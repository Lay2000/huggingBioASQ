A plant cytosine methyltransferase cDNA was isolated using degenerate oligonucleotides, based on homology between prokaryote and mouse methyltransferases, and PCR to amplify a short fragment of a methyltransferase gene. A fragment of the predicted size was amplified from genomic DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana. Overlapping cDNA clones, some with homology to the PCR amplified fragment, were identified and sequenced. The assembled nucleic acid sequence is 4720 bp and encodes a protein of 1534 amino acids which has significant homology to prokaryote and mammalian cytosine methyltransferases. Like mammalian methylases, this enzyme has a C terminal methyltransferase domain linked to a second larger domain. The Arabidopsis methylase has eight of the ten conserved sequence motifs found in prokaryote cytosine-5 methyltransferases and shows 50% homology to the murine enzyme in the methyltransferase domain. The amino terminal domain is only 24% homologous to the murine enzyme and lacks the zinc binding region that has been found in methyltransferases from both mouse and man. In contrast to mouse where a single methyltransferase gene has been identified, a small multigene family with homology to the region amplified in PCR has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana."

Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, fragile and soft skin, delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars, easy bruising, and generalized joint hypermobility. It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity. It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the \u03b11 and the \u03b12-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. No treatment for the underlying defect is presently available for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, a series of preventive guidelines are applicable."

The preparative regimen consisted of fludarabine, Ara-C and amsacrine (FLAMSA) chemotherapy, followed by reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 3 days later. In vivo T-cell depletion by anti-thymocyte globulin was used to protect from early GvHD, and prophylactic donor lymphocyte transfusion was given from day+120 to augment the GvL effect, once tolerance was established.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Recent studies showed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) are significantly upregulated in both the tumor and its microenvironment, and act as key regulators of proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Our previous study showed that IL-8 overexpression in colorectal cancer cells triggers the upregulation of the CXCR2-mediated proliferative pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the CXCR2 antagonist, SCH-527123, inhibits colorectal cancer proliferation and if it can sensitize colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin both in vitro and in vivo. SCH-527123 showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects in HCT116, Caco2, and their respective IL-8-overexpressing variants colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, SCH-527123 was able to suppress CXCR2-mediated signal transduction as shown through decreased phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/AKT pathway. These findings corresponded with decreased cell migration and invasion, while increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines. In vivo results verified that SCH-527123 treatment decreased tumor growth and microvessel density when compared with vehicle-treated tumors. Importantly, these preclinical studies showed that the combination of SCH-527123 and oxaliplatin resulted in a greater decrease in cell proliferation, tumor growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis that was superior to single-agent treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that targeting CXCR2 may block tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. In addition, CXCR2 blockade may further sensitize colorectal cancer to oxaliplatin treatment."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognosis of liver disease in Aagenaes syndrome (lymphoedema cholestasis syndrome 1 (LCS1)), which is an autosomal recessive inherited syndrome consisting of neonatal cholestasis with intermittent cholestatic episodes in childhood into adulthood and development of lymphoedema. Forty Norwegian patients are known to have this condition, 25 of whom are alive. A clinical description of the liver disease is supplied with a case-control study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper we review the course of the liver disease in the Norwegian cohort of patients and present results from a case-control study in the patients above 10 years of age. The case-control study was performed on 15 patients without clinical cholestasis (itching and sometimes jaundice) at the time of the study. An evaluation of 11 patients above 15 years of age without chronic biochemical cholestasis (increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and/or serum bile acids) was also carried out. For each patient one randomly identified control person was included (15 in one study, 11 in the other). RESULTS: Cirrhosis with either transplantation or death in infancy or early childhood occurred in six patients; slowly developing cirrhosis occurred in three patients. Two patients may be in the process of developing cirrhosis. Significantly increased ALP and GGT levels were found in patients with normal liver biochemistry in the preceding years when compared with the case control group. Additionally, albumin was found to be lower in older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with that for other types of hereditary neonatal cholestasis, patients with LCS1 have a relatively good prognosis. More than 50% can expect a normal life span."

Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase with tumor grade, and elevated serum IL-6 correlates with poor breast cancer patient survival. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes such as impaired E-cadherin expression or aberrant Vimentin induction are associated with enhanced metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Despite this fact, few tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular signaling factors capable of provoking such a phenotypic transition have been identified. In this study, we showed that IL-6 promoted E-cadherin repression among a panel of estrogen receptor-alpha-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic stable IL-6 expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7(IL-6)) exhibited an EMT phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin expression and induction of Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail and Twist. MCF-7(IL-6) cells formed xenograft tumors that displayed loss of E-cadherin, robust Vimentin induction, increased proliferative indices, advanced tumor grade and undifferentiated histology. Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis."

Increasing evidence indicates that such problems are related to abnormal pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors and that treatments providing more continuous stimulation reduce the risk of motor complications. It is possible that administering levodopa with a reversible catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor at frequent intervals might reduce the risk of these complications. Stalevo (Orion) combines levodopa, the dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa and the catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor entacapone in a single tablet.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) predominantly establishes latent infection in B cells, and the reactivation of the virus from latency is dependent on the expression of the viral BZLF1 protein. The BZLF1 promoter (Zp) normally exhibits only low basal activity but is activated in response to chemical or biological inducers, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), calcium ionophores, or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. In some cell lines latently infected with EBV, an HDAC inhibitor alone can induce BZLF1 transcription, while the treatment does not enhance expression in other cell lines, such as B95-8 or Raji cells, suggesting unknown suppressive mechanisms besides histone deacetylation in those cells. Here, we found the epigenetic modification of the BZLF1 promoter in latent Raji cells by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), H3K9me2/me3, and H4K20me3. Levels of active markers such as histone acetylation and H3K4me3 were low in latent cells but increased upon reactivation. Treatment with 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), an inhibitor of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, significantly enhanced the BZLF1 transcription in Raji cells when in combination with an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). The knockdown of Ezh2 or Suv420h1, histone methyltransferases for H3K27me3 or H4K20me3, respectively, further proved the suppression of Zp by the methylations. Taken together, the results indicate that H3K27 methylation and H4K20 methylation are involved, at least partly, in the maintenance of latency, and histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation correlate with the reactivation of the virus in Raji cells."

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial. We further evaluated the efficacy of tofacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

Heterozygous activating mutations in the gene encoding for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) have recently been shown to be a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. Kir6.2 is expressed in muscle, neuron and brain as well as the pancreatic beta-cell, so patients with KCNJ11 mutations could have a neurological phenotype in addition to their diabetes. It is proposed that some patients with KCNJ11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes (DEND), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes. We identified KCNJ11 mutations in four of 10 probands with permanent neonatal diabetes and one affected parent; this included the novel C166F mutation and the previously described V59M and R201H. Four of the five patients with mutations had neurological features: the patient with the C166F mutation had marked developmental delay, severe generalised epilepsy, hypotonia and muscle weakness; mild developmental delay was present in the patient with the V59M mutation; one patient with the R201H mutation had acute and chronic neurological consequences of cerebral oedema and another had diabetic neuropathy from chronic hyperglycaemia. In conclusion, the clinical features in these patients support the existence of a discrete neurological syndrome with KCNJ11 mutations. The severe DEND syndrome was seen with the novel C166F mutation and mild developmental delay with the V59M mutation. These features differ markedly from the neurological consequences of acute or chronic diabetes."

Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a noncollagenous extracellular protein, plays critical roles in bone mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in DMP1 gene have been identified as the molecular cause of ARHR. Here, we describe a Japanese family that includes two ARHR-affected siblings carrying a novel mutation of the DMP1 gene. The patients were a 53-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man with short stature and skeletal deformities who were the offspring of a first-cousin marriage. Biochemical examination revealed hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate excretion and low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D. Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium excretion were within the normal range, leading to clinical diagnosis of ARHR. Sequence analysis of peripheral leukocytes from the patients revealed that they carried a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene (98G>A, W33X), which leads to a truncated DMP protein with no putative biological function. Unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation. This is the first report of a Japanese family with ARHR carrying a novel mutation of the DMP1 gene."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several mutations in the apoB, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and MTP genes result in low or absent levels of apoB and LDL-cholesterol in plasma, which cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia. Mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene cause familial combined hypolipidemia. Clinical manifestations range from none to severe, debilitating, and life-threatening disorders. This review summarizes recent genetic, metabolic, and clinical findings and presents an update on management strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma have now been identified in heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia probably because of decreased triglyceride transport capacity from the liver. ANGPTL3 mutations cause low levels of LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol in compound heterozygotes and homozygous individuals, decrease reverse cholesterol transport, and lower glucose levels. The effect on atherosclerosis is unknown; however, severe fatty liver has been identified. Loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, which appears to lower risk for coronary artery disease and has no adverse sequelae. Phase III clinical trials are now underway examining the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on cardiovascular events in combination with statin drugs. SUMMARY: Mutations causing low LDL-cholesterol and apoB have provided insight into lipid metabolism, disease associations, and the basis for drug development to lower LDL-cholesterol in disorders causing high levels of cholesterol. Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent adverse sequelae from familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia."

Moreover, the spatial and longitudinal relationship of tau distribution compared with \u03b2 - amyloid and other pathologies in these diseases can be mapped. In this review, we discuss the role of aggregated tau in tauopathies, the challenges posed in developing selective tau ligands as biomarkers, the state of development in tau tracers, and the new clinical information that has been uncovered, as well as the opportunities for improving diagnosis and designing clinical trials in the future."

Oral anticoagulants of the 4-hydroxycoumarin class, typified by warfarin, are used worldwide to treat thromboembolic disease. These drugs show the beneficial attributes of high efficacy and low cost, but patient management can be complicated by their narrow therapeutic index and wide inter-individual variability in dosing. Our understanding of the latter complication has improved significantly in recent years due to intense investigation of genetic factors influencing drug pharmacokinetics (CYP2C9) and pharmacodynamic response (VKORC1). In particular, the discovery of polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene that strongly impact oral anticoagulant dose has heightened expectations that genetic testing for a relatively small cadre of warfarin-response genes might substantially enhance patient care in this area, especially during the initiation phase of therapy. However, enthusiasm for genotype-based dosing of oral anticoagulants must be balanced against the ready availability of both a simple phenotypic test (prothrombin time) and an antidote to over-anticoagulation (vitamin K). Wide-spread acceptance of genetically based tests for establishing therapy with warfarin and its congeners will likely require additional evidence that such an approach offers protection against a variety of negative anticoagulation outcomes, especially severe bleeding, as well as offering utility across many racial populations. This article will review recent events in these and other related areas."

In this study, we show that both the RII receptor Punt (Put) and the R-Smad Smad2 are strongly required for cell and tissue growth. Knocking down the expression of Put or Smad2 in salivary glands causes alterations in nucleolar structure and functions. Cells with decreased TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling accumulate intermediate pre-rRNA transcripts containing internal transcribed spacer 1 regions accompanied by the nucleolar retention of ribosomal proteins. Thus, our results show that TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling is required for ribosomal biogenesis, a key aspect of cellular growth control. Importantly, overexpression of Put enhanced cell growth induced by Drosophila Myc, a well-characterized inducer of nucleolar hypertrophy and ribosome biogenesis."

For this latter property, the median survival has not been improved since 1990 despite preoperative administration of chemotherapeutic agents. The prediction of tumor response before chemotherapy treatment would constitute a major progress for this pathology. We assessed in this study if miRNA profiling could surpass the current limitations for osteosarcoma diagnosis. We measured the miRNA expression in different osteosarcoma samples: (i) 27 osteosarcoma paraffin-embedded tumors from patients, (ii) human osteosarcoma cell lines, and (iii) tumors from a syngeneic rat osteosarcoma model, recapitulating human osteosarcoma. miRNA profiles were determined using microfluidic cards performing high-throughput TaqMan(\u00ae) -based PCR assays, called TaqMan(\u00ae) Low Density Arrays. Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR-92a, miR-99b, miR-132, miR-193a-5p and miR-422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis. These discriminating miRNAs, as well as those identified in rat, targeted the TGF\u03b2, the Wnt and the MAP kinase pathways. These results indicate that our platform constitutes a potent diagnostic tool to predict tumor sensitivity to a drug in attempt to better adapt treatment to tumor biological specificities and also to identify new potential therapeutic strategies."

Top-down analysis of intact proteins by mass spectrometry provides an ideal platform for comprehensive proteoform characterization, in particular, for the identification and localization of post-translational modifications (PTM) co-occurring on a protein. One of the main bottlenecks in top-down proteomics is insufficient protein sequence coverage caused by incomplete protein fragmentation. Based on previous work on peptides, increasing sequence coverage and PTM localization by combining sequential ETD and HCD fragmentation in a single fragmentation event, we hypothesized that protein sequence coverage and phospho-proteoform characterization could be equally improved by this new dual fragmentation method termed EThcD, recently been made available on the Orbitrap Fusion. Here, we systematically benchmark the performance of several (hybrid) fragmentation methods for intact protein analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion, using as a model system a 17.5 kDa N-terminal fragment of the mitotic regulator Bora. During cell division Bora becomes multiply phosphorylated by a variety of cell cycle kinases, including Aurora A and Plk1, albeit at distinctive sites. Here, we monitor the phosphorylation of Bora by Aurora A and Plk1, analyzing the generated distinctive phospho-proteoforms by top-down fragmentation. We show that EThcD and ETciD on a Fusion are feasible and capable of providing richer fragmentation spectra compared to HCD or ETD alone, increasing protein sequence coverage, and thereby facilitating phosphosite localization and the determination of kinase specific phosphorylation sites in these phospho-proteoforms.

It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins. Fused genes have been identified as non-transitive patterns of similarity in triplets of genes. To be computationally tractable, this approach usually imposes an a priori distinction between a dataset in which fused genes are searched for, and a dataset that may have provided genetic material for fusion. This reduces the 'genetic space' in which fusion can be discovered, as only a subset of triplets of genes is investigated. Moreover, this approach may have a high-false-positive rate, and it does not identify gene families descending from a common fusion event. RESULTS: We represent similarities between sequences as a network. This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python program FusedTriplets. Furthermore, we propose a new characterization of families of fused genes, as clique minimal separators of the sequence similarity network. This well-studied graph topology provides a robust and fast method of detection, well suited for automatic analyses of big datasets. We implemented this method in the C++ program MosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false-positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. The grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction errors from real biological fusions, and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes.

Backmasking is a recording technique used to hide a sound or message in a music track in reverse, meaning that it is only audible when the record is played backwards. Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary DNA strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable ncRNAs (CUTs), so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable ncRNAs (SUTs), presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense RNA in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome."

Campath-1H is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 expressed on lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. It has been tested extensively in lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation. Although its use in children has been limited to date, so far it appears to be well tolerated in children. Currently, studies are being implemented to further assess its safety and efficacy in pediatric organ transplantation. Immune cell depletion using Campath-1H appears to be particularly useful in organ transplantation in that lower doses of maintenance immunosuppressive drugs are needed. This feature is particularly attractive in children."

The organization of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin makes it inaccessible to the factors required for gene transcription and DNA replication, recombination, and repair. In addition to histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which play key roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering the chromatin structure, cells have developed a mechanism of modulating chromatin structure by incorporating histone variants. These variants are incorporated into specific regions of the genome throughout the cell cycle. H2A.Z, which is an evolutionarily conserved H2A variant, performs several seemingly unrelated and even contrary functions. Another H2A variant, H2A.X, plays a very important role in the cellular response to DNA damage. This review summarizes the recent developments in our understanding of the role of H2A.Z and H2A.X in the regulation of chromatin structure and function, focusing on their functional links with chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes."

BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an idiopathic steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease that represents an important cause of stroke. However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3."

In malignancies, these signaling pathways are often exploited to optimize tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, they represent attractive targets for cancer therapy. This review will summarize current knowledge of the small-molecule multiple-kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. These inhibitors generally hinder the phosphorylation of several protein kinases of membrane receptors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, and cytoplasmic receptors such as c-Kit, Raf kinase, and FLT3.

Backmasking is a recording technique used to hide a sound or message in a music track in reverse, meaning that it is only audible when the record is played backwards. Analogously, the compact yeast genome encodes for diverse sources of information such as overlapping coding and non-coding transcripts, and protein-binding sites on the two complementary DNA strands. Examples are the consensus binding site sequences of the RNA-binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 that target non-coding transcripts for degradation. Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies. They are always depleted in the sense direction of protein-coding genes, thus avoiding degradation of the transcript. However in the antisense direction, predicted binding sites occur at high frequencies in genes with overlapping unstable ncRNAs (CUTs), so limiting the availability of non-functional transcripts. In contrast they are depleted in genes with overlapping stable ncRNAs (SUTs), presumably to avoid degrading the non-coding transcript. The protein-coding genes maintain similar amino-acid contents, but they display distinct codon usages so that Nrd1 and Nab3-binding sites can arise at differing frequencies in antisense depending on the overlapping transcript type. Our study demonstrates how yeast has evolved to encode multiple layers of information-protein-coding genes in one strand and the relative chance of degrading antisense RNA in the other strand-in the same regions of a compact genome."

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare the maternal outcome of pregnancies complicated by HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome, partial HELLP syndrome, or severe preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study we reviewed the maternal charts of 316 women with HELLP syndrome or severe preeclampsia managed at our perinatal center between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1995. HELLP syndrome was strictly defined by previously published laboratory criteria. Women were divided into three groups: HELLP syndrome (n = 67), partial HELLP syndrome (one or two but not all three features of HELLP syndrome, n = 71), and severe preeclampsia (no features of HELLP syndrome, n = 178). Results were compared by chi 2 analysis and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean gestational ages at delivery in the HELLP, partial HELLP, and severe preeclampsia groups were, respectively, 31.7, 32.7, and 34.5 weeks (p < 0.001 between HELLP and severe preeclampsia). There was one maternal death from intracerebral hemorrhage in the HELLP group. In women with HELLP syndrome there was a higher incidence of cesarean section (p < 0.05), disseminated intravascular coagulation (p < 0.001), and need for transfusion (p < 0.001) than in the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Higher incidences of maternal complications in women with HELLP syndrome stress the importance of strict criteria for the definition of HELLP syndrome. Women with partial HELLP syndrome should be studied and managed separately from women with complete HELLP syndrome."

The aim of this prospective study was to compare triple test screening (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-chorionic gonadotrophin and unconjugated oestriol) with amniocentesis in the detection of fetuses with Down's syndrome in women of 35 years of age or more. Between 1992 and 1996, maternal serum markers were evaluated in 1406 women who had amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities related to a maternal age of 35 or more years. Sixteen fetuses with Down's syndrome were identified in the whole group by amniocentesis and karyotyping. The group with negative triple test screening consisted of 919 pregnancies and included two fetuses with trisomy-21 (false negatives). With triple test screening in the age group over 35, there was a detection rate of 87.5% for cut-off points ranging from 1:200 up to 1:350, with corresponding false positive rates ranging between 23% and 34%. In our population, if we had practiced the policy of offering amniocentesis only to women screening positive for the ages of 35 and 36 and to all pregnant women of 37 or more, we would have carried out 30% less amniocenteses. In this group of 1406 women, 33 abnormal karyotypes were detected with amniocentesis (16 Down's syndrome included) and equal number of elective abortions were carried out. Nevertheless, 19 healthy fetuses and neonates were lost after amniocentesis. Considering the high detection rates that can be achieved with triple test screening, the existing procedure related risk of amniocentesis (0.5-1.0%), and the facts that conception in women over 35 years of age is usually more difficult and the background loss usually higher than in younger women, we believe that in the future women over 35 should be offered a choice between non-invasive and invasive procedures after being thoroughly informed."

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial. We further evaluated the efficacy of tofacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

Since dovitinib is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and targets brain tumor-relevant pathways, we conducted a phase I trial to demonstrate its safety in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with first or second GBM recurrence started treatment with the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) previously established in systemic cancer patients (500\u00a0mg/d, 5\u00a0days on/2\u00a0days off). A modified 3\u00a0+\u00a03 design in three cohorts (500, 400, 300\u00a0mg) was used. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled. Seventy-two adverse events (AEs) occurred and 16.7\u00a0% of AEs were classified as > CTC grade 3 toxicity, mainly including hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity. Only one out of six patients of the 300-mg cohort showed grade 3 toxicity. The PFS-6 rate was 16.7\u00a0%, and it was not associated with detection of the FGFR-TACC gene fusion in the tumor. CONCLUSION: Dovitinib is safe in patients with recurrent GBM and showed efficacy in only some patients unselected for target expression. The recommended phase II dose of 300\u00a0mg would be substantially lower than the recently established MTD in systemic cancer patients. Further personalized trials are recommended."

Research in bioinformatics primarily involves collection and analysis of a large volume of genomic data. Naturally, it demands efficient storage and transfer of this huge amount of data. In recent years, some research has been done to find efficient compression algorithms to reduce the size of various sequencing data. One way to improve the transmission time of large files is to apply a maximum lossless compression on them. In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available. In order to achieve this, we exploit the prior knowledge of the file format and specifications. Our experimental results show that our encoding scheme improves compression ratio, thereby reducing overall transmission time significantly."

Past medical history revealed hearing loss and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Routine karyotype demonstrated extra chromosomal material on 6p. Single nucleotide polymorphism microarray revealed a previously unreported complex de novo genetic rearrangement involving subtelomeric segments on chromosomes 6p and 12q. The duplicated/deleted regions included several known OMIM-annotated genes. This novel phenotype and genotype provides information about a possible association of genomic copy number variation and moyamoya syndrome. Dosage-sensitive genes in the deleted and duplicated segments may be involved in aberrant vascular proliferation. Our case also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive evaluation of both developmental delay and congenital anomalies such as moyamoya."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression levels of miR-146a and miR -16 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their correlation to the disease activity. METHODS: The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-16 in the in PBMCs were measured using real-time RT-PCR in 40 RA patients and 16 healthy individuals. The correlations of miR-146a and miR-16 expressions to the disease activity of RA were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-16 in the PBMCs of RA patients increased significantly compared to those in the healthy individuals (P<0.05). Their expression levels was significantly higher in active RA patients than in patients with disease remission (P<0.05) and healthy individuals (P<0.01). The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-16 were positively correlated to ESR, CRP and the disease activity scores in 28 joints (DAS28) (P<0.01), but not to RF (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The elevated expression levels of miR-146a and miR-16 are correlated to RA disease activity, suggesting their value in assessment of the clinical disease activity of RA."

T4, T3, 3,5-T2, and DIT (10 n m) all increased current density relative to control to a similar degree: to 1.22+/-0.2, 1.21+/-0.03, 1.16+/-0.02 and 1.16+/-0.03, respectively, P<0.05. In contrast, thyroid hormone analogs with an altered side group of the inner iodophenyl ring, including tetrac, triac, and D-T3, had no effect on INa nor did rT3, MIT or tyrosine. Pretreatment with rT3 inhibited the effects of T4, T3, 3,5-T2, and DIT. Conversely, the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative that antagonizes thyroid hormone actions, on INa was blocked when myocytes were pretreated with T3(100 n m, n=3), suggesting an interaction of T3 with amiodarone. The enhancement of INa by T3 and 3, 5-T2 could not be blocked by propranolol, suggesting that the effects are not mediated through beta -adrenergic signaling pathways. In conclusion, the present results suggest that the acute effects of thyroid hormone and analogs on cardiac INa are mediated by a non-genomic thyroid hormone receptor with a unique structure-activity relationship."

Adult skeletal muscle is a very stable tissue containing a small population of myofiber-associated quiescent satellite cells compared with late embryonic/neonatal skeletal muscle, which contains highly proliferating myoblasts and small actively growing myofibers, suggesting that specific regulatory pathways may control myogenesis at distinct developmental stages. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway is central for myogenesis, based on studies using immortalized and neonatal primary myoblasts in vitro. However, the contribution of this pathway to adult myogenesis has never been investigated. Four p38 isoforms (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta) exist in mammalian cells, being p38alpha and p38gamma the most abundantly expressed isoforms in adult skeletal muscle. Given the embryonic/neonatal lethality of p38alpha-deficient mice, here we investigate the relative contribution of p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta to adult myogenesis. Regeneration and myofiber growth of adult muscle proceeds with similar efficiency in mice lacking p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta as in wild-type control mice. In agreement with this, there is no difference in adult primary myoblasts behavior in vitro among the different genotypes. Importantly, the pattern of p38 activation (ascribed to p38alpha) remains unperturbed during satellite cell-mediated myogenesis in vitro and adult muscle regeneration in wild type and p38beta-, p38gamma- and p38delta-deficient mice, rendering p38alpha as the essential p38 isoform sustaining adult myogenesis. This study constitutes the first analysis addressing the functionality of p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta in satellite cell-dependent adult muscle regeneration and growth."

The pathophysiological bases of the disorder(s) are elusive. We performed a mutational analysis of NEFL in a series of 177 index cases with CMT and without mutations in the genes for peripheral myelin protein zero (MPZ), peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) and connexin 32 (GJB1); the motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) at the median nerve was below 38 m/s in 76 cases and above 38 m/s in 101. We identified five new pedigrees with four mutations in the head and rod domains of NF-L, including a novel Leu268Pro substitution and a novel del322Cys_326Asn deletion. Several examined affected members exhibited marked variability in the severity of disease and age at onset. Nerve conduction alterations were consistent with an axonal neuropathy often associated with demyelinating features, such as prolonged distal latencies (DL). Pathological examination of sural nerve biopsies in the probands detected in four cases a chronic axonal neuropathy dominated by focal accumulations of NF with axonal swellings (giant axons) and significant secondary demyelination; in the fifth case no NFs accumulations were evident but many myelinated fibres consisted exclusively of microtubules with few or absent NF. The pathological phenotype correlated with the pattern of nerve conduction alterations and indicated that NEFL mutations cause a profound alteration of the cytoskeleton possibly related to defective targeting of NF."

The expression of circadian clock genes in peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes from 38 patients with SSNHL and 71 healthy subjects was accessed using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and validated using immunocytochemical staining.We found that 61.8% of patients with SSNHL suffered from insomnia before the insult of hearing loss. Besides, significantly decreased expression of PER1, CRY1, CRY2, CLOCK, BMAL1, and CKl\u03b5 was found in PB leukocytes of patients with SSNHL when compared with healthy subjects. SSNHL patients with vertigo had significantly lower expression of CRY1 and CKl\u03b5 than patients without vertigo symptoms.

Large genomic rearrangements in SCN5A have been associated with conduction disease, but its prevalence in BS is unknown. Seventy-six non-related patients with BS were studied. Clinical characteristics and family risk profile were recorded. Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively. Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X). Patients with mutations had a trend toward a higher proportion of spontaneous type I Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) (87.5% vs 52.9%, p = 0.06) and had evidence of familial disease (62.5%, vs 23.5%, p = 0.03). The symptoms and risk profile of the carriers were not different from wild-type probands. There were non-significant differences in the prevalence of type I ECG, syncope and history of arrhythmia in carriers of selected polymorphisms. None of the patients had any deletion/duplication in the SCN5A gene. In conclusion, 10.5% of our patients had mutations in the SCN5A gene. Patients with mutations seemed to have more spontaneous type I ECG, but no differences in syncope or arrhythmic events compared with patients without mutations. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the SCN5A in the expression of the phenotype and prognosis. Large rearrangements were not identified in the SCN5A gene using the MLPA technique."

During cell division, segregation of sister chromatids to daughter cells is achieved by the poleward pulling force of microtubules, which attach to the chromatids by means of a multiprotein complex, the kinetochore. Kinetochores assemble at the centromeric DNA organized by specialized centromeric nucleosomes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, which typically have large repetitive centromeric regions, budding yeast CEN DNA is defined by a 125 bp sequence and assembles a single centromeric nucleosome. In budding yeast, as well as in other eukaryotes, the Cse4 histone variant (known in vertebrates as CENP-A) is believed to substitute for histone H3 at the centromeric nucleosome. However, the exact composition of the CEN nucleosome remains a subject of debate. We report the use of a novel ChIP approach to reveal the composition of the centromeric nucleosome and its localization on CEN DNA in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed a strong interaction of H3, as well as Cse4, H4, H2A, and H2B, but not histone chaperone Scm3 (HJURP in human) with the centromeric DNA. H3 localizes to centromeric DNA at all stages of the cell cycle. Using a sequential ChIP approach, we could demonstrate the co-occupancy of H3 and Cse4 at the CEN DNA. Our results favor a H3-Cse4 heterotypic octamer at the budding yeast centromere. Whether or not our model is correct, any future model will have to account for the stable association of histone H3 with the centromeric DNA."

RESULTS: Girls with the high-activity allele had significantly lower body mass index (BMI; \u03b2 = -0.25 \u00b1 0.98, P = 0.011) compared to those with the low activity allele. Experience of negative familial stressors (e.g., death or illness of family members, hit or scolded by parents and increased quarrelling with parents, parents argued frequently) significantly weakened this protective genetic effect on BMI (P for interaction = 0.043). Stratified analyses showed a significant protective genetic effect on BMI only within the stratum of low stress level (\u03b2 = -0.44 \u00b1 0.14, P = 0.002). No similar effect was observed among boys. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the genetic effects of MAOA uVNTR polymorphism on BMI in a Chinese adolescent population and suggest potential genetic interactions with negative familial stressors."

BACKGROUND: Pathogen-specific metabolic pathways may be detected by breath tests based on introduction of stable isotopically-labeled substrates and detection of labeled products in exhaled breath using portable infrared spectrometers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested whether mycobacterial urease activity could be utilized in such a breath test format as the basis of a novel biomarker and diagnostic for pulmonary TB. Sensitized New-Zealand White Rabbits underwent bronchoscopic infection with either Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rabbits were treated with 25 mg/kg of isoniazid (INH) approximately 2 months after infection when significant cavitary lung pathology was present. [(13)C] urea was instilled directly into the lungs of intubated rabbits at selected time points, exhaled air samples analyzed, and the kinetics of delta(13)CO(2) formation were determined. Samples obtained prior to inoculation served as control samples for background (13)CO(2) conversion in the rabbit model. (13)CO(2), from metabolic conversion of [(13)C]-urea by mycobacterial urease activity, was readily detectable in the exhaled breath of infected rabbits within 15 minutes of administration. Analyses showed a rapid increase in the rate of (13)CO(2) formation both early in disease and prior to treatment with INH. Following INH treatment, all evaluable rabbits showed a decrease in the rate of (13)CO(2) formation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Urea breath testing may provide a useful diagnostic and biomarker assay for tuberculosis and for treatment response. Future work will test specificity for M. tuberculosis using lung-targeted dry powder inhalation formulations, combined with co-administering oral urease inhibitors together with a saturating oral dose of unlabeled urea, which would prevent the delta(13)CO(2) signal from urease-positive gastrointestinal organisms."

BACKGROUND: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 5 (CMTX5), Arts syndrome, and non-syndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2) are allelic syndromes, caused by reduced activity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS-I) due to loss-of-function mutations in PRPS1. As only few families have been described, knowledge about the relation between these syndromes, the phenotypic spectrum in patients and female carriers, and the relation to underlying PRS-I activity is limited. METHODS: We investigated a family with a novel PRPS1 mutation (c.830A > C, p.Gln277Pro) by extensive phenotyping, MRI, and genetic and enzymatic tests. RESULTS: The male index subject presented with an overlap of CMTX5 and Arts syndrome features, whereas his sister presented with prelingual DFN2. Both showed mild parietal and cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Enzymatically, PRS-I activity was undetectable in the index subject, reduced in his less affected sister, and normal in his unaffected mother. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CMTX5, Arts syndrome and DFN2 are phenotypic clusters on an intrafamilial continuum, including overlapping phenotypes even within individuals. The respective phenotypic presentation seems to be determined by the exact PRPS1 mutation and the residual enzyme activity, the latter being largely influenced by the degree of skewed X-inactivation. Finally, our findings show that brain atrophy might be more common in PRPS1-disorders than previously thought."

OBJECTIVE: To identify and categorize the variety of current mobile apps available in dermatology for patients and providers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Dermatology-related search terms were queried in the online app stores of the most commonly used mobile platforms developed by Apple, Android, Blackberry, Nokia, and Windows. Applications were assigned to categories based on description. Popularity, price, and reviews were recorded and target audiences were determined through websites offering online mobile apps. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number, type, and price of mobile apps in dermatology. RESULTS: A total of 229 dermatology-related apps were identified in the following categories: general dermatology reference (61 [26.6%]), self-surveillance/diagnosis (41 [17.9%]), disease guide (39 [17.0%]), educational aid (20 [8.7%]), sunscreen/UV recommendation (19 [8.3%]), calculator (12 [5.2%]), teledermatology (8 [3.5%]), conference (6 [2.6%]), journal (6 [2.6%]), photograph storage/sharing (5 [2.2%]), dermoscopy (2 [0.9%]), pathology (2 [0.9%]), and other (8 [3.5%]). The most reviewed apps included Ultraviolet ~ UV Index (355 reviews), VisualDx (306), SPF (128), iSore (61), and SpotMole (50). There were 209 unique apps, with 17 apps existing on more than 1 operating system. More than half of the apps were offered free of charge (117 [51.1%]). Paid apps (112 [48.9%]) ranged from $0.99 to $139.99 (median, $2.99). Target audiences included patient (117 [51.1%]), health care provider (94 [41.0%]), and both (18 [7.9%]).

Attachment of ubiquitin to proteins represents a central mechanism for the regulation of protein metabolism and function. In the NF-kappaB pathway, binding of NEMO to polyubiquitinated substrates initiates the pathway in response to cellular stimuli. Other polyubiquitin binding proteins can antagonize this pathway by competing with NEMO for polyubiquitin. We have used protein arrays to identify polyubiquitin binding proteins that regulate NF-kappaB activity. Using polyubiquitin as bait, protein arrays were screened and polyubiquitin binders identified. Novel polyubiquitin binders AWP1, CALCOCO2, N4BP1, RIO3, TEX27, TTC3, UBFD1 and ZNF313 were identified using this approach, while known NF-kappaB regulators including NEMO, A20, ABIN-1, ABIN-2, optineurin and p62 were also identified. Overexpressed AWP1 and RIO3 repressed NF-kappaB activity in a manner similar to optineurin, while siRNAs directed against AWP1 and RIO3 also reduced NF-kappaB activity. TNFalpha-dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha was also suppressed by overexpression of AWP1 and RIO3, possibly due to the polyubiquitin binding activity of these proteins. Protein array screening using polyubiquitin enabled rapid identification of many known and novel polyubiquitin binding proteins and the identification of novel NF-kappaB regulators."

BACKGROUND: Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS) is a developmental disorder characterised by reduced growth, microcephaly, ocular anomalies (microcornea, strabismus, myopia, and pale optic disk), distinctive facial features (narrow palpebral fissures, telecanthus, sparse and laterally broad eyebrows, preauricular tags, and micrognathia), mental retardation, and generalised hypotonia. KOS is a rare, possibly underestimated condition, with fewer than 10 cases reported to date. Here we investigate the molecular cause underlying KOS. METHODS: An exome sequencing approach was used on a single affected individual of an Italian consanguineous family coupled with mutation scanning using Sanger sequencing on a second unrelated subject with clinical features fitting the disorder. RESULTS: Exome sequencing was able to identify homozygosity for a novel truncating mutation (c.556C>T, p.Arg186stop) in UBE3B, which encodes a widely expressed HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Homozygosity for a different nonsense lesion affecting the gene (c.1166G>A, p.Trp389stop) was documented in the second affected subject, supporting the recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder. Mutation scanning of the entire UBE3B coding sequence on a selected cohort of subjects with features overlapping, in part, those recurring in KOS did not reveal disease-causing mutations, suggesting phenotypic homogeneity of UBE3B lesions. DISCUSSION: Our data provide evidence that KOS is caused by UBE3B loss of function, and further demonstrate the impact of misregulation of protein ubiquitination on development and growth. The available clinical records, including those referring to four UBE3B mutation-positive subjects recently described as belonging to a previously unreported entity, which fits KOS, document the clinical homogeneity of this disorder."

Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcription coactivator, is the major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, which plays a critical role in organ size control and cancer development. However, how YAP is regulated by extracellular stimuli in tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Netrin-1, a laminin-related secreted protein, displays proto-oncogenic activity in cancers. Nonetheless, the downstream signaling mediating its oncogenic effects is not well defined. Here we show that netrin-1 via its transmembrane receptors, deleted in colorectal cancer and uncoordinated-5 homolog, up-regulates YAP expression, escalating YAP levels in the nucleus and promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration. Inactivating netrin-1, deleted in colorectal cancer, or uncoordinated-5 homolog B (UNC5B) decreases YAP protein levels, abrogating cancer cell progression by netrin-1, whereas knockdown of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) or large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (Lats1/2), two sets of upstream core kinases of the Hippo pathway, has no effect in blocking netrin-1-induced up-regulation of YAP. Netrin-1 stimulates phosphatase 1A to dephosphorylate YAP, which leads to decreased ubiquitination and degradation, enhancing YAP accumulation and signaling. Hence, our findings support that netrin-1 exerts oncogenic activity through YAP signaling, providing a mechanism coupling extracellular signals to the nuclear YAP oncogene."

Discriminant analysis was applied to the construction of recognition functions for various components of gene structure. Linear discriminant functions for splice sites, 5'-coding, internal exon, and 3'-coding region recognition have been developed. A gene structure prediction system FGENE has been developed based on the exon recognition functions. We compute a graph of mutual compatibility of different exons and present a gene structure models as paths of this directed acyclic graph. For an optimal model selection we apply a variant of dynamic programming algorithm to search for the path in the graph with the maximal value of the corresponding discriminant functions. Prediction by FGENE for 185 complete human gene sequences has 81% exact exon recognition accuracy and 91% accuracy at the level of individual exon nucleotides with the correlation coefficient (C) equals 0.90. Testing FGENE on 35 genes not used in the development of discriminant functions shows 71% accuracy of exact exon prediction and 89% at the nucleotide level (C = 0.86). FGENE compares very favorably with the other programs currently used to predict protein-coding regions.

To detect cells just after division, we used colchicine, which inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division. Although normal Closterium cells had two chloroplasts before and after cell division, cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Electron microscopic observation showed that irregular-shaped chloroplasts existed in ampicillin-treated Closterium cells. Because antibiotic treatments resulted in the appearance of long cells with irregular chloroplasts and cell death, we counted cell types in the culture.

Based on molecular aberrations, in particular the NPM1 mutation (NPM1(mut)) and the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (Flt3-ITD), prognostic subgroups have been defined among patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype. Whereas these subgroups are known to play an important role in outcome in first complete remission, and also in the indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, data are limited on their role after transplantation in advanced disease. To evaluate the role of molecular subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype after allogeneic stem cell transplantation beyond first complete remission, we analyzed the data from 141 consecutive adults (median age: 51.0 years, range 18.4-69.3 years) who had received an allogeneic transplant either in primary induction failure or beyond first complete remission. A sequential regimen of cytoreductive chemotherapy (fludarabine, high-dose AraC, amsacrine) followed by reduced intensity conditioning (FLAMSA-RIC), was uniformly used for conditioning. After a median follow up of three years, overall survival from transplantation was 64 \u00b1 4%, 53 \u00b1 4% and 44 \u00b1 5% at one, two and four years, respectively. Forty patients transplanted in primary induction failure achieved an encouraging 2-year survival of 69%. Among 101 patients transplanted beyond first complete remission, 2-year survival was 81% among patients with the NPM1(mut)/FLT3(wt) genotype in contrast to 43% in other genotypes. Higher numbers of transfused CD34(+) cells (hazard ratio 2.155, 95% confidence interval 0.263-0.964, P=0.039) and favorable genotype (hazard ratio 0.142, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.898, P=0.048) were associated with superior overall survival in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype can frequently be rescued after primary induction failure by allogeneic transplantation following FLAMSA-RIC.

Protein citrullination, a once-obscure post-translational modification (PTM) of peptidylarginine, has recently become an area of significant interest because of its suspected role in human disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and also because of its newfound role in gene regulation. One protein isozyme responsible for this modification, protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), has also been proposed to \"reverse\" epigenetic histone modifications made by the protein arginine methyltransferases. Here, we review the in vivo and in vitro studies of transcriptional regulation by PAD4, evaluate conflicting evidence for its ability to use methylated peptidylarginine as a substrate, and highlight promising areas of future work. Understanding the interplay of multiple arginine PTMs is an emerging area of importance in health and disease and is a topic best addressed by novel tools in proteomics and chemical biology."

The mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) is a conserved large hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, crucial for the maintenance of cristae morphology. MINOS has been suggested to represent the core of an extended protein network that controls mitochondrial function and structure, and has been linked to several human diseases. The spatial arrangement of MINOS within mitochondria is ill-defined, however. Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy, we determined the distribution of three known human MINOS subunits (mitofilin, MINOS1, and CHCHD3) in mammalian cells. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that all three subunits form similar clusters within mitochondria, and that MINOS is more abundant in mitochondria around the nucleus than in peripheral mitochondria. At the submitochondrial level, mitofilin, a core MINOS subunit, is preferentially localized at cristae junctions. In primary human fibroblasts, mitofilin labeling uncovered a regularly spaced pattern of clusters arranged in parallel to the cell growth surfaces. We suggest that this array of MINOS complexes might explain the observed phenomenon of largely horizontally arranged cristae junctions that connect the inner boundary membrane to lamellar cristae. The super-resolution images demonstrate an unexpectedly high level of regularity in the nanoscale distribution of the MINOS complex in human mitochondria, supporting an integrating role of MINOS in the structural organization of the organelle."

PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathy caused by mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene. It is characterized by insidious onset with a selective degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, variable loss of visual acuity, temporal optic nerve pallor, tritanopia, and development of central, paracentral, or cecocentral scotomas. Here we describe the clinical and molecular findings in a large Italian family with ADOA. METHODS: Routine ophthalmologic examination and direct sequencing of all coding regions of the OPA1 gene were performed. Further characterization of a new OPA1 gene insertion was performed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of RNA from patients and control subjects. RESULTS: We identified an Alu-element insertion located in intron 7 of OPA1 causing an in-frame deletion of exon 8 in 18 family members. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted consequence of this mutation is the loss of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of OPA1. Alu insertions have been reported in the literature as causing human genetic disease. However, this is the first report of a pathogenic OPA1 gene mutation resulting from an Alu insertion."

We screened 12 Finnish CPVT probands for mutations in these genes and identified three novel RYR2 mutations (V2306I, P4902L, R4959Q), which were absent in unaffected and control individuals. Although no obvious disease-causing mutations were identified in the CASQ2 gene, the molecular screening revealed two novel amino-acid polymorphisms (T66A and V76M). The frequencies of these polymorphisms in 185 unrelated probands with long QT syndrome and in 280 healthy blood donors were not significantly different. These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT."

The 'accuracy' of age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration and diabetes (ABCD(2)) scoring by non-stroke specialists referring patients to a daily Rapid Access Stroke Prevention (RASP) service is unclear, as is the accuracy of ABCD(2) scoring by trainee residents. In this prospective study, referrals were classified as 'confirmed TIAs' if the stroke specialist confirmed a clinical diagnosis of possible, probable or definite TIA, and 'non-TIAs' if patients had a TIA mimic or completed stroke. ABCD(2) scores from referring physicians were compared with scores by experienced stroke specialists and neurology/geriatric medicine residents at a daily RASP clinic; inter-observer agreement was examined. Data from 101 referrals were analysed (mean age=60.0years, 58% male). The median interval between referral and clinic assessment was 1day. Of 101 referrals, 52 (52%) were 'non-TIAs': 45 (86%) of 52 were 'TIA mimics' and 7 (14%) of 52 were completed strokes. There was only 'fair' agreement in total ABCD(2) scoring between referring physicians and stroke specialists (\u03ba=0.37). Agreement was 'excellent' between residents and stroke specialists (\u03ba=0.91). Twenty of 29 patients scored as 'moderate to high risk' (score 4-6) by stroke specialists were scored 'low risk' (score 0-3) by referring physicians. ABCD(2) scoring by referring doctors is frequently inaccurate, with a tendency to underestimate stroke risk. These findings emphasise the importance of urgent specialist assessment of suspected TIA patients, and that ABCD(2) scores by non-stroke specialists cannot be relied upon in isolation to risk-stratify patients. Inter-observer agreement in ABCD(2) scoring was 'excellent' between residents and stroke specialists, indicating short-term training may improve accuracy."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence. METHODS: We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with ICH at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score > or = 4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort. RESULTS: At 90 days, 162 (26%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, ICH location, volume (all P<0.0001), and pre-ICH cognitive impairment (P=0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score > or = 4. The FUNC score was developed as a sum of individual points (0-11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score > or = 4 increased steadily with FUNC score. No patient assigned a FUNC score < or = 4 achieved functional independence, whereas > 80% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the FUNC score remained unchanged when restricted to ICH survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care. CONCLUSIONS: FUNC score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with ICH who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials."

Transmembrane beta barrel (TMB) proteins are found in the outer membranes of bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. TMBs are involved in a variety of functions such as mediating flux of metabolites and active transport of siderophores, enzymes and structural proteins, and in the translocation across or insertion into membranes. We present here TMBHMM, a computational method based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of putative TMBs from sequence. In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands. The training of the TMBHMM was performed on a non-redundant data set of 19 TMBs. The self-consistency test yielded Q(2) accuracy of 0.87, Q(3) accuracy of 0.83, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.74 and SOV for beta strand of 0.95. In this self-consistency test the method predicted 83% of transmembrane residues with correct exposure status. On an unseen, non-redundant test data set of 10 proteins, the 2-state and 3-state TMBHMM prediction accuracies are around 73% and 72%, respectively, and are comparable to other methods from the literature. The TMBHMM web server takes an amino acid sequence or a multiple sequence alignment as an input and predicts the exposure status and the structural topology as output.

In A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, TGF-\u03b2 elicited EMT in Smad-dependent manner and TNF-\u03b1 accelerated this process, as confirmed by cell morphology, expression of EMT markers, capacity of gelatin lysis and cell invasion. TNF-\u03b1 stimulated the phosphorylation of Smad2 linker region, and this effect was attenuated by inhibiting MEK or JNK pathway. Comprehensive expression analysis unraveled genes differentially regulated by TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and ECM (extracellular matrices), suggesting the drastic change in autocrine/paracrine signals as well as cell-to-ECM interactions. Integrated analysis of microRNA signature enabled us to identify a subset of genes, potentially regulated by microRNAs. Among them, we confirmed TGF-\u03b2-mediated induction of miR-23a in lung epithelial cell lines, target genes of which were further identified by gene expression profiling. Combined with in silico approaches, we determined HMGN2 as a downstream target of miR-23a. These findings provide a line of evidence that the effects of TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were partially mediated by microRNAs, and shed light on the complexity of molecular events elicited by TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1."

BACKGROUND: Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is one of the most severe forms of preeclampsia and aggravates both maternal and perinatal prognosis. The systematic review available in Cochrane Library compared corticosteroid (dexamethasone, betamethasone, or prednisolone) given during pregnancy, just after delivery or in the postnatal period, or both before and after birth, with placebo or no treatment. Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. There was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. These benefits appear to be greater in Class I HELLP syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of dexamethasone for accelerating postpartum recovery in patients with Class I HELLP syndrome in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a triple blind randomized controlled trial including women with class I HELLP syndrome, and exclusion criteria were dexamethasone use in the last 15 days before diagnosis of HELLP syndrome; chronic use of corticosteroids; chronic diseases that alter laboratory parameters of HELLP Syndrome, such as chronic liver disease or purpura, patients unable to consent (coma or critical clinical condition) and without accompanying persons that may consent to study participation.Eligible patients will be invited to participate and those who agree will be included in the study and receive placebo or dexamethasone according to a random list of numbers and subjects will receive the study medication every 12 hours for two days.During the study the women will be subject to strict control of blood pressure and urine output. Laboratory tests will be performed at regular intervals during treatment and 24 hours and 48 hours after its suspension. If worsening of clinical or laboratory variables is observed, a rescue scheme of dexamethasone will be administrated. This proposal has already obtained approval of the local Institutional Review Board of the coordinating center (IMIP, Recife, Brazil), all other participating centers and of the National Council for Ethics in Research (CONEP) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients, who face an elevated risk of stroke but difficulty sustaining warfarin treatment. The oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). This prespecified secondary analysis compares outcomes in older and younger patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: There were 6229 patients (44%) aged > 75 years with atrial fibrillation and > 2 stroke risk factors randomized to warfarin (target international normalized ratio=2.0-3.0) or rivaroxaban (20 mg daily; 15 mg if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), double blind. The primary end point was stroke and systemic embolism by intention to treat. Over 10 866 patient-years, older participants had more primary events (2.57% versus 2.05%/100 patient-years; P=0.0068) and major bleeding (4.63% versus 2.74%/100 patient-years; P<0.0001). Stroke/systemic embolism rates were consistent among older (2.29% rivaroxaban versus 2.85% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.02) and younger patients (2.00% versus 2.10%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.19; interaction P=0.313), as were major bleeding rates ( > 75 years: 4.86% rivaroxaban versus 4.40% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.34; <75 years: 2.69% versus 2.79%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.19; interaction P=0.336). Hemorrhagic stroke rates were similar in both age groups; there was no interaction between age and rivaroxaban response. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had higher stroke and major bleeding rates than younger patients, but the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban relative to warfarin did not differ with age, supporting rivaroxaban as an alternative for the elderly."

MOTIVATION: Transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins are embedded in the outer membranes of mitochondria, Gram-negative bacteria and chloroplasts. These proteins perform critical functions, including active ion-transport and passive nutrient intake. Therefore, there is a need for accurate prediction of secondary and tertiary structure of TMB proteins. Traditional homology modeling methods, however, fail on most TMB proteins since very few non-homologous TMB structures have been determined. Yet, because TMB structures conform to specific construction rules that restrict the conformational space drastically, it should be possible for methods that do not depend on target-template homology to be applied successfully. RESULTS: We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. Using the transFold dataset TMBpro predicts secondary structure with per-residue accuracy (Q(2)) of 77.8%, a correlation coefficient of 0.54, and TMBpro predicts beta-contacts with precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.67. Using the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts secondary structure with Q(2) of 88.3% and a correlation coefficient of 0.75. All of these performance results exceed previously published results by 4% or more. Working with the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts the tertiary structure of transmembrane segments with RMSD <6.0 A for 9 of 14 proteins. For 6 of 14 predictions, the RMSD is <5.0 A, with a GDT_TS score greater than 60.0. AVAILABILITY: http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/psss.html."

In the last decade, new therapeutic approaches targeting \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) have been discovered and developed with the hope of modifying the natural history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The most revolutionary of these approaches consists in the removal of brain A\u03b2 via anti-A\u03b2 antibodies. After an active vaccine (AN1792) was discontinued in 2002 due to occurrence of meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of patients, several other second-generation active A\u03b2 vaccines and passive A\u03b2 immunotherapies have been developed and are under clinical investigation with the aim of accelerating A\u03b2 clearance from the brain of AD patients. The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, which is composed of humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies that has been tested in two Phase II trials. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce A\u03b2 burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE \u03b54 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use. The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab will provide answers regarding whether passive anti-A\u03b2 immunization is able to alter the course of this devastating disease."

Through the ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc, human somatic cells can be converted to a pluripotent state, generating so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)(1-4). Patient-specific iPSCs lack the ethical concerns that surround embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and would bypass possible immune rejection. Thus, iPSCs have attracted considerable attention for disease modeling studies, the screening of pharmacological compounds, and regenerative therapies(5). We have shown the generation of transgene-free human iPSCs from patients with different lung diseases using a single excisable polycistronic lentiviral Stem Cell Cassette (STEMCCA) encoding the Yamanaka factors(6). These iPSC lines were generated from skin fibroblasts, the most common cell type used for reprogramming. Normally, obtaining fibroblasts requires a skin punch biopsy followed by expansion of the cells in culture for a few passages. Importantly, a number of groups have reported the reprogramming of human peripheral blood cells into iPSCs(7-9). In one study, a Tet inducible version of the STEMCCA vector was employed(9), which required the blood cells to be simultaneously infected with a constitutively active lentivirus encoding the reverse tetracycline transactivator. In contrast to fibroblasts, peripheral blood cells can be collected via minimally invasive procedures, greatly reducing the discomfort and distress of the patient. A simple and effective protocol for reprogramming blood cells using a constitutive single excisable vector may accelerate the application of iPSC technology by making it accessible to a broader research community. Furthermore, reprogramming of peripheral blood cells allows for the generation of iPSCs from individuals in which skin biopsies should be avoided (i.e. aberrant scarring) or due to pre-existing disease conditions preventing access to punch biopsies. Here we demonstrate a protocol for the generation of human iPSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using a single floxed-excisable lentiviral vector constitutively expressing the 4 factors. Freshly collected or thawed PBMCs are expanded for 9 days as described(10,11) in medium containing ascorbic acid, SCF, IGF-1, IL-3 and EPO before being transduced with the STEMCCA lentivirus. Cells are then plated onto MEFs and ESC-like colonies can be visualized two weeks after infection. Finally, selected clones are expanded and tested for the expression of the pluripotency markers SSEA-4, Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. This protocol is simple, robust and highly consistent, providing a reliable methodology for the generation of human iPSCs from readily accessible 4 ml of blood."

The mechanism of DNA replication is one of the driving forces of genome evolution. Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC contains two domains, the 3'-5'exonuclease domain and the polymerase domain, while DnaE only possesses the polymerase domain. Accordingly, DnaE does not have the proofreading function; in Escherichia coli, another enzyme DnaQ performs this function. In most bacteria, the fidelity of DNA replication is maintained by 3'-5' exonuclease and a mismatch repair (MMR) system. However, we found that most Actinobacteria (a group of Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content) appear to have lost the MMR system and chromosomes may be replicated by DnaE-type DNA polymerase III with DnaQ-like 3'-5' exonuclease. We tested the mutation bias of Bacillus subtilis, which belongs to the Firmicutes and found that the wild type strain is AT-biased while the mutS-deletant strain is remarkably GC-biased. If we presume that DnaE tends to make mistakes that increase GC content, these results can be explained by the mutS deletion (i.e., deletion of the MMR system). Thus, we propose that GC content is regulated by DNA polymerase and MMR system, and the absence of polC genes, which participate in the MMR system, may be the reason for the increase of GC content in Gram-positive bacteria such as Actinobacteria."

Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a multifunctional serine protease, involved in infection defense, inflammatory process regulation, and physiopathological processes of several diseases. We developed aptamer-capture based assays for human neutrophil elastase with different substrates and solid supports to meet different demands, such as simplicity, sensitivity, and high throughput. Aptamers against HNE were immobilized on magnetic beads or microplates as affinity ligands to capture HNE, and then the enriched HNE catalyzed the conversion of chromogenic substrates or fluorogenic substrates to products. The measurement of the generated enzymatic products enabled the final detection of HNE. In the assay using chromogenic substrates and aptamer modified magnetic beads, 0.4 pM HNE could be successfully detected. The sensitivity of the assay was further improved by using fluorogenic substrates, and a detection limit of HNE at 20 fM was achieved. The use of aptamer-coated microplates instead of aptamer modified magnetic beads in the assays also allowed the sensitive detection of HNE, offering advantages in fast sample handling and measurement. The established assays for HNE displayed good specificity, and proteins including serum albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin G, thrombin, porcine pancreatic elastase, trypsin, proteinase K, chymotrypsin, lysozyme, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 did not cause interference in the detection of HNE."

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis function.

The topic of this review is how Tibetans have adapted genetically to high altitude, particularly with reference to altitude-induced changes in metabolism. What advances does it highlight? It highlights recent work on metabolic phenotyping in Tibetans and demonstrates that selected genetic haplotypes influence their metabolism of fats and glucose. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude. Consistent with the phenotype, EGLN1 in Tibetans has a gain-of-function mutation that confers a higher affinity for oxygen, hence less sensitivity to hypoxia. Considering the demands imposed upon metabolism in meeting energy demands despite limitations on fuel oxidation, we hypothesized that other selected genes might alter metabolism to allow adaptation to altitude despite the desensitization of the upstream hypoxia sensing caused by the EGLN1 mutation that results in the failure to sense hypoxia. A shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would provide adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Measurements of serum metabolites from Tibetans living at high altitude are consistent with this hypothesis; the EPAS1 haplotype is significantly associated with increased lactate levels (suggesting increased anaerobic metabolism), and the PPARA haplotype and serum free fatty acids are positively related (suggesting decreased fat oxidation). These data suggest that the high-altitude adaptations may offer protection from diabetes at high altitude but increase the risk of diabetes at lower elevations and/or with adoption of a non-traditional diet. It should also be considered in future work in the field that because iron is a cofactor for EGLN1, there may be significant associations of phenotypes with the significant degrees of variation seen in tissue iron among human populations."

OBJECTIVES: Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) modulates metabolism of serotonin and dopamine metabolism, neurotransmitters involved in regulation of appetite and food intake. The gene coding for MAOA contains a 30-bp tandem repeat (uVNTR) polymorphism in its promoter region that has been previously identified to be associated with obesity with mixed findings in the literature. Our goals were to replicate the population effects of this functional polymorphism on obesity risk, and to further explore gender differences and interaction effects with negative stressors. METHODS: Analyses were conducted with data on genotypes, measured weight and height, and self-reported behavioural characteristics among 1101 Chinese adolescents 11-15 years old living in Wuhan, China. RESULTS: Girls with the high-activity allele had significantly lower body mass index (BMI; \u03b2 = -0.25 \u00b1 0.98, P = 0.011) compared to those with the low activity allele. Experience of negative familial stressors (e.g., death or illness of family members, hit or scolded by parents and increased quarrelling with parents, parents argued frequently) significantly weakened this protective genetic effect on BMI (P for interaction = 0.043). Stratified analyses showed a significant protective genetic effect on BMI only within the stratum of low stress level (\u03b2 = -0.44 \u00b1 0.14, P = 0.002). No similar effect was observed among boys. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the genetic effects of MAOA uVNTR polymorphism on BMI in a Chinese adolescent population and suggest potential genetic interactions with negative familial stressors."

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The decision for operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases is dependent on the patient's predicted survival. Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution. PATIENT SAMPLE: The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patients. The potential prognostic factors that are known to influence survival such as general condition, extraspinal bone metastases, vertebral bone metastases, visceral metastases, and neurologic assessment based on Frankel score were also studied. METHODS: The predicted survival according to the four scoring systems were calculated and labeled as \"A\" scores. These patients were then rescored by assigning NPC as a good prognostic tumor and labeled as \"B\" scores. The predicted survival of scores A and B were compared with actual survival. Potential prognostic factors of survival were investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. For all scoring systems, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests were done; the predictive values were calculated using postestimation after Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The median overall survival for the whole cohort was 13 (range 1-120) months. In multivariate analysis, general condition (p<.01), visceral metastases (p<.01), and vertebral metastases (p<.01) showed significant association with survival. The absolute score of all scoring systems was significantly associated with actual survival, which extended to the different prognostic subgroups of each scoring systems. Log-rank test revealed significant differences in survival between the different prognostic subgroups of all scoring systems (p<.01). Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosis. All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so."

Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the CD52 protein present at high levels on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. In clinical trials, alemtuzumab has shown a clinical benefit superior to that of interferon-\u03b2 in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. Treatment with alemtuzumab leads to the depletion of circulating lymphocytes followed by a repopulation process characterized by alterations in the number, proportions and properties of lymphocyte subsets. Of particular interest, an increase in the percentage of T cells with a regulatory phenotype (Treg cells) has been observed in multiple sclerosis patients after alemtuzumab. Since Treg cells play an important role in the control of autoimmune responses, the effect of alemtuzumab on Treg cells was further studied in vitro. Alemtuzumab effectively mediated complement-dependent cytolysis of human T lymphocytes and the remaining population was enriched in T cells with a regulatory phenotype. The alemtuzumab-exposed T cells displayed functional regulatory characteristics including anergy to stimulation with allogeneic dendritic cells and ability to suppress the allogeneic response of autologous T cells. Consistent with the observed increase in Treg cell frequency, the CD25(hi) T-cell population was necessary for the suppressive activity of alemtuzumab-exposed T cells. The mechanism of this suppression was found to be dependent on both cell-cell contact and interleukin-2 consumption. These findings suggest that an alemtuzumab-mediated increase in the proportion of Treg cells may play a role in promoting the long-term efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with multiple sclerosis."

In its classic form, it is characterized by mucocutaneous abnormalities, BM failure, and a predisposition to cancer. BM failure is the principal cause of premature mortality. Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized. Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2). DC is therefore principally a disease of defective telomere maintenance and patients usually have very short telomeres. The genetic advances have led to the unification of DC with several other disorders, including the severe multisystem disorders Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classic DC to aplastic anemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance-\"the telomereopathies.\" These advances have increased our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and highlighted the important role of telomerase and telomeres in human biology. They are also facilitating the diagnosis (especially when presentation is atypical) and management of DC."

The purpose of our prospective single-center study was to examine the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following a sequential conditioning regimen as first-line therapy for previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS or sAML. Between November 2003 and June 2010, 30 patients (20 high-risk MDS, 10 sAML) received fludarabine (4 \u00d7 30 mg/m(2)), amsacrine (4 \u00d7 100 mg/m(2)), and Ara-C (4 \u00d7 2 g/m(2), FLAMSA). After 2 to 3 days of rest, patients received high-dose melphalan alone (200 mg/m(2) for patients with an age <50 years, 150 mg/m(2) for patients with an age between 50 and 60 years, and 100 mg/m(2) for patients with an age >60 years; n = 24) or melphalan and thiotepa (10 mg/kg, Mel/Thio, n = 6).

Antithymocyte globulin (Fresenius 30-60 mg/kg) as well as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. All patients except 1 with primary graft failure achieved complete remission after HSCT. After a median follow-up time of 28 months (range: 7-81), 21 patients (70%) were alive and free of disease. Overall, 4 patients relapsed. At 2 years, overall survival, event-free survival, and treatment-related mortality were 70%, 63%, and 30%, respectively.

Despite the success of anti-TNF therapies in the treatment of IBD, a considerable proportion of patients are refractory to treatment, highlighting an unmet medical need for new therapies. Molecules that direct the trafficking of inflammatory cells, such as the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin, are attractive targets for new drug candidates. The \u03b14\u03b27 integrin is involved in lymphocyte recruitment to the normal and inflamed gut mucosa, and the lymphoid tissue. The pan-\u03b14 integrin neutralizing mAb, natalizumab, is not gut-selective but has demonstrated efficacy in IBD. However, treatment was associated with the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which has limited its use, especially in Europe. Vedolizumab (MNL-0002), Millennium Pharmaceutical's gut-specific, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin-neutralizing mAb, does not affect peripheral blood cell counts and appears to lack systemic effects.

Enterobacteriaceae isolates from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2000-2004) demonstrating decreased susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], > or =2 mg/L) were evaluated for the production of metallo-beta-lactamases and serine carbapenemases using disk approximation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Carbapenemase-producing strains were epidemiologically typed by automated riboprinting and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to establish clonality. Among 37,557 Enterobacteriaceae (5 genus groups) evaluated, 119 (0.32%) had increased carbapenem MIC values, and a carbapenemase was identified in 51 (42.9%) of these strains. KPC-2 and KPC-3 were the most frequently occurring carbapenemases (24 isolates, 20.2%) in the United States and were detected in Klebsiella spp, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens strains isolated in New York, Arkansas, and Virginia.

Clonal dissemination of carbapenemase-producing strains was observed in several medical centers on both continents. The occurrence of carbapenemases in various Enterobacteriaceae remains rare but appears to be spreading geographically (not in Latin America), mainly with metallo-beta-lactamases being found in Mediterranean Europe and KPC enzymes in the New York City area."

Rictor is upregulated via the repression of the miR-424/503 cluster in human prostate and colon cancer cell lines that harbor c-Src upregulation and in Src-transformed cells. The tumorigenicity and invasive activity of these cells were suppressed by re-expression of miR-424/503. Rictor upregulation promotes formation of mTORC2 and induces activation of mTORC2, resulting in promotion of tumor growth and invasion. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-424/503 is associated with Rictor upregulation in colon cancer tissues.

Using a stepwise pre-RC assembly assay, we investigated the fate of pre-RC components during later stages of the reaction. We determined that helicase loading is accompanied by dissociation of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 from origin DNA. This dissociation requires ATP hydrolysis at a late stage of pre-RC assembly.

Recent findings have shown that the blood vessels of different organs exert an active role in regulating organ function. In detail, the endothelium that aligns the vasculature of most organs is fundamental in maintaining organ homeostasis and in promoting organ recovery following injury. Mechanistically, endothelial cells (EC) of tissues such as the liver, lungs or the bone marrow (BM) have been shown to produce \"angiocrine\" factors that promote organ recovery and restore normal organ function. Controlled production of angiocrine factors following organ injury is therefore essential to promote organ regeneration and to restore organ function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated production and function of such \"angiocrine\" factors are largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study. In detail, we identified for the first time a microRNA (miRNA) expressed by BM EC that regulates the expression of angiocrine genes involved in BM recovery following irradiation. Using a microarray-based approach, we identified several miRNA expressed by irradiated BMEC. After validating the variations in miRNA expression by semi-quantitative PCR, we chose to study further the ones showing consistent variations between experiments, and those predicted to regulate (directly or indirectly) angiogenic and angiocrine factors. Of the mi-RNA that were chosen, miR-363-5p (previously termed miR-363*) was subsequently shown to modulate the expression of numerous EC-specific genes including some angiocrine factors. By luciferase reporter assays, miR-363-5p is shown to regulate the expression of angiocrine factors tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp-1) and thrombospondin 3 (THBS3) at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, miR-363-5p reduction using anti-miR is shown to affect EC angiogenic properties (such as the response to angiogenic factors stimulation) and the interaction between EC and hematopoietic precursors (particularly relevant in a BM setting). miR-363-5p reduction resulted in a significant decrease in EC tube formation on matrigel, but increased hematopoietic precursor cells adhesion onto EC, a mechanism that is shown to involve kit ligand-mediated cell adhesion. Taken together, we have identified a miRNA induced by irradiation that regulates angiocrine factors expression on EC and as such modulates EC properties. Further studies on the importance of miR-363-5p on normal BM function and in disease are warranted."

          "context": "Evidence for a diagnostic window in fourth generation assays for HIV. BACKGROUND: The routine HIV screening essentially depends on the detection of HIV specific antibodies. However, HIV p24 antigen can be detected in individuals with recent HIV infection about 2-18 days prior to seroconversion. New fourth generation HIV screening assays combine the detection of anti-HIV antibodies with the simultaneous detection of HIV p24 antigen. This may result in a reduction of the diagnostic window after primary infection. OBJECTIVES: The performance of two novel fourth generation assays in routine diagnostic was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: We compared two third generation, two fourth generation and one antigen HIV assays in a case with acute primary HIV infection. RESULTS: In our case, the HIV infection was detected 11 days earlier with the fourth generation assays compared to third generation assays. Interestingly, after the initial reactive results the fourth generation assays became negative resulting in a second diagnostic window. During this second diagnostic window neither third nor fourth generation HIV assays were reactive. This second diagnostic window was caused by the absence of HIV specific antibodies and the decline of HIV p24 antigen concentrations below the detection limits of the fourth generation assays. CONCLUSIONS: Fourth generation assays markedly improve the diagnosis of recent HIV infections but the possibility of a second diagnostic window must be considered."

          "context": "[Warfarin resistance and related pharmacogenetic information]. Warfarin is the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy worldwide. Its clinical use, however, is complicated by the fact that it has a narrow therapeutic index with potential bleeding complications. The dosage requirement of warfarin to produce therapeutic anticoagulation varies widely among patients. Recently genetic factors such as the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes have been demonstrated to be determinants of warfarin response. CYP2C9 is the enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolic clearance of the S-enantiomer of warfarin. VKORC1 is the target protein of warfarin which recycles the reduced form of vitamin K, an essential cofactor in the formation of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. There is strong evidence to support an association between these genetic variants and a therapeutic dose of warfarin. On the basis of these observations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a labeling change for warfarin that includes the genetic information of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as factors influencing interindividual variability in warfarin dosing. The package insert as of August 2007 states that \"lower initiation doses should be considered for patients with certain genetic variations in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 enzymes.\" The FDA has also approved clinical tests for these genetic variants. However, at this time, validated dosing algorithm and evidence to support the clinical utility of genotyping and reliable economic analysis are lacking to recommend for routine CYP2C9 and VKORC1 testing in every patiens before the initiation of warfarin therapy. In this review, we present the results of several prospective randomised controlled trials conducted to test the impact of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in Caucasian and Asian patients initiating warfarin."

          "context": "Widespread bidirectional promoters are the major source of cryptic transcripts in yeast. Pervasive and hidden transcription is widespread in eukaryotes, but its global level, the mechanisms from which it originates and its functional significance are unclear. Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These transcripts are targeted for degradation immediately after synthesis by the action of the Nrd1-exosome-TRAMP complexes. Although CUT degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of CUTs are unknown. Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters. An RNA fraction highly enriched in CUTs was analysed by a 3' Long-SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) approach adapted to deep sequencing. The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise. Moreover, the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes. Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end. Our study of glycolysis genes, as well as recent results from the literature, indicate that such concurrent transcription is potentially associated with regulatory mechanisms. Our data reveal numerous new CUTs with such a potential regulatory role. However, most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters. Eukaryotic promoter regions are thus intrinsically bidirectional, a fundamental property that escaped previous analyses because in most cases divergent transcription generates short-lived unstable transcripts present at very low steady-state levels."

Sequential use of chemotherapy and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been proposed to improve the treatment outcomes in patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we present our experience with this procedure in a cohort of 60 AML patients with primary induction failure (n = 9); early, refractory, or > second relapse (n = 41); or unfavorable cytogenetics (n = 10). A combination of fludarabine (30 mg/m\u00b2/day), cytarabine (2 g/m\u00b2/day), and amsacrine (100 mg/m\u00b2/day) for 4 days was used. After 3 days of rest, RIC was carried out, consisting of 4 Gy total body irradiation, antithymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius), and cyclophosphamide (fludarabine, amsacrine, and cytarabine (FLAMSA)-RIC protocol). Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (pDLIs) were given in patients with complete remission (CR) and without evidence of graft-versus-host disease > 120 days after SCT. The median time of neutrophil engraftment was 17 days. CR was achieved in 47 of 60 patients (78%). Eleven patients received pDLIs resulting in long-term CR in eight of them. Non-relapse mortality after 1 and 3 years was 25 and 28%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 10-69), 3-year overall survival and 3-year progression-free survival were 42 and 33%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, dose of CD34(+) cells >5 \u00d7 10\u2076/kg (p = 0.005; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.276), remission of AML before SCT (p = 0.044; HR = 0.421), and achievement of complete chimerism after SCT (p = 0.001; HR = 0.205) were significant factors of better overall survival. The use of the FLAMSA-RIC protocol in suitable high-risk AML patients results in a long-term survival rate of over 40%."

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal white matter visible by brain imaging. It is estimated that at least 30% to 40% of individuals remain without a precise diagnosis despite extensive investigations. We mapped tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH) to 10q22.3-23.1 in French-Canadian families and sequenced candidate genes within this interval. Two missense and one insertion mutations in five individuals with TACH were uncovered in POLR3A, which codes for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Because these families were mapped to the same locus as leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) and presented clinical and radiological overlap with individuals with hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome, we sequenced this gene in nine individuals with 4H and eight with LO. In total, 14 recessive mutations were found in 19 individuals with TACH, 4H, or LO, establishing that these leukodystrophies are allelic. No\u00a0individual was found to carry two nonsense mutations. Immunoblots on 4H fibroblasts and on the autopsied brain of an individual diagnosed with 4H documented a significant decrease in POLR3A levels, and there was a more significant decrease in the cerebral white\u00a0matter compared to that in the cortex. Pol III has a wide set of target RNA transcripts, including all nuclear-coded tRNA. We hypothesize that the decrease in POLR3A leads to dysregulation of the expression of certain Pol III targets and thereby perturbs cytoplasmic protein synthesis. This type of broad alteration in protein synthesis is predicted to occur in other leukoencephalopathies such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3, caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1)."

The epithelium to mesenchyme transition is thought to play a fundamental role during embryonic development and tumor progression. Loss of cell-cell adhesion and modification of both cell morphology and gene expression are the main events associated with this transition. There is a large amount of evidence suggesting that growth factors can initiate these events. Yet, the connection from growth factor induction to changes in cell adhesion and morphology is largely unknown. To elucidate this connection, we have investigated the action of IGF-II on E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex-mediated cell-cell adhesion and on beta-catenin/TCF-3 mediated gene expression. We can show that (1) IGF-II induces a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition; (2) IGF1R, the receptor for IGF-II, belongs to the same membrane complex as E-cadherin and beta-catenin; (3) IGF-II induces a redistribution of beta-catenin from the plasma membrane to the nucleus and an intracellular sequestration and degradation of E-cadherin; (4) IGF-II induces the transcription of beta-catenin/TCF-3 target genes. Based on the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell adhesion during EMT."

To better understand the microbial functional diversity changes with subsurface redox conditions during in situ uranium bioremediation, key functional genes were studied with GeoChip, a comprehensive functional gene microarray, in field experiments at a uranium mill tailings remedial action (UMTRA) site (Rifle, CO). The results indicated that functional microbial communities altered with a shift in the dominant metabolic process, as documented by hierarchical cluster and ordination analyses of all detected functional genes. The abundance of dsrAB genes (dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes) and methane generation-related mcr genes (methyl coenzyme M reductase coding genes) increased when redox conditions shifted from Fe-reducing to sulfate-reducing conditions. The cytochrome genes detected were primarily from Geobacter sp. and decreased with lower subsurface redox conditions. Statistical analysis of environmental parameters and functional genes indicated that acetate, U(VI), and redox potential (E(h)) were the most significant geochemical variables linked to microbial functional gene structures, and changes in microbial functional diversity were strongly related to the dominant terminal electron-accepting process following acetate addition. The study indicates that the microbial functional genes clearly reflect the in situ redox conditions and the dominant microbial processes, which in turn influence uranium bioreduction. Microbial functional genes thus could be very useful for tracking microbial community structure and dynamics during bioremediation."

We describe analytic performance characteristics of the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, the test used to select patients for the pivotal vemurafenib trials.

Sensitivity was assessed using blends of cell lines or tumor DNA, and tumor specimens with low levels of mutant alleles, as determined by 454 sequencing (a quantitative next-generation pyrosequencing method). A >96% hit rate was obtained across all specimen types with 5% mutant alleles at a DNA input of 125 ng, an amount readily obtained from one 5-\u03bcm section. The cobas test showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than direct bidirectional sequencing in a panel of 219 melanoma specimens. Cross reactivity with V600K and V600D was observed. Repeated testing of 5 specimens by 2 operators, using different instruments and reagent lots, yielded correct calls in 158/160 tests (98.8%). A set of 26 highly pigmented samples were identified that gave invalid test results. A simple 1:2 dilution resulted in a valid test result of 76% in such cases.

          "context": "The exosome component Rrp6 is required for RNA polymerase II termination at specific targets of the Nrd1-Nab3 pathway. The exosome and its nuclear specific subunit Rrp6 form a 3'-5' exonuclease complex that regulates diverse aspects of RNA biology including 3' end processing and degradation of a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and unstable transcripts. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism. NNS-dependent termination is coupled to RNA 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of ncRNA transcripts including CUTs. To determine the role of Rrp6 in NNS termination globally, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on total RNA and perform ChIP-exo analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) localization. Deletion of RRP6 promotes hyper-elongation of multiple NNS-dependent transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in RNAPII termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known NNS targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at CUTs. Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the NNS complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end RNA processing and/or degradation at specific targets."

Long-term, in vitro propagation of tumor-specific endothelial cells (TEC) allows for functional studies and genome-wide expression profiling of clonally derived, well-characterized subpopulations. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of mammary adenocarcinoma, we have optimized an isolation procedure and defined growth conditions for long-term propagation of mammary TEC. The isolated TEC maintain their endothelial specification and phenotype in culture. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of multiple TEC subpopulations revealed striking, persistent overexpression of several candidate genes including Irx2 and Zfp503 (transcription factors), Alcam and Cd133 (cell surface markers), Ccl4 and neurotensin (Nts) (angiocrine factors), and Gpr182 and Cnr2 (G protein-coupled receptors). Taken together, we have developed an effective method for isolating and culture-expanding mammary TEC, and uncovered several new TEC-selective genes whose overexpression persists even after long-term in vitro culture. These results suggest that the tumor microenvironment may induce changes in vascular endothelium in vivo that are stably transmittable in vitro."

PURPOSE: The available clinical data on target-specific oral anticoagulant (TSOAC) reversal agents that are currently in development or have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewed. SUMMARY: The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration. Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within 10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well tolerated in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs."

We have recently described the presence of a high proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (20%) with an increased mutation frequency (mutators) in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In four out of 11 independent P. aeruginosa strains, the high mutation frequency was found to be complemented with the wild-type mutS gene from P. aeruginosa PAO1. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of two additional P. aeruginosa mismatch repair genes and the characterization, by complementation of deficient strains, of these two putative P. aeruginosa mismatch repair genes (mutL and uvrD). We also describe the alterations in the mutS, mutL and uvrD genes responsible for the mutator phenotype of hypermutable P. aeruginosa strains isolated from CF patients. Seven out of the 11 mutator strains were found to be defective in the MMR system (four mutS, two mutL and one uvrD). In four cases (three mutS and one mutL), the genes contained frameshift mutations. The fourth mutS strain showed a 3.3 kb insertion after the 10th nucleotide of the mutS gene, and a 54 nucleotide deletion between two eight nucleotide direct repeats. This deletion, involving domain II of MutS, was found to be the main one responsible for mutS inactivation. The second mutL strain presented a K310M mutation, equivalent to K307 in Escherichia coli MutL, a residue known to be essential for its ATPase activity. Finally, the uvrD strain had three amino acid substitutions within the conserved ATP binding site of the deduced UvrD polypeptide, showing defective mismatch repair activity. Interestingly, cells carrying this mutant allele exhibited a fully active UvrABC-mediated excision repair. The results shown here indicate that the putative P. aeruginosa mutS, mutL and uvrD genes are mutator genes and that their alteration results in a mutator phenotype."

Some miRNAs as miR-1, miR-133 and miR-208a are highly expressed in the heart and strongly associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. The differential regulation of miRNAs in response to exercise suggests a potential value of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers of physiological mediators of the cardiovascular adaptation induced by exercise. Likewise, serum levels of c-miRNAs such as miR-423-5p have been evaluated as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. On the other hand, the manipulation of miRNAs levels using techniques such as 'miR mimics' and 'antagomiRs' is becoming evident the enormous potential of miRNAs as promising therapeutic strategies in heart failure."

Here, we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans. We show by RNA interference (RNAi) and biochemical depletion that NDC1 plays an important role in NPC and NE assembly in vivo and in vitro. RNAi experiments suggest a functional link between NDC1 and the soluble nucleoporins Nup93, Nup53, and Nup205. Importantly, NDC1 interacts with Nup53 in vitro.

Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Imatinib-induced changes were blocked with the EGFR antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of EGFR in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with imatinib demonstrated activation of EGFR and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and EGFR, but not Her2/ErbB2. An in vitro kinase assay showed that imatinib did not directly affect EGFR kinase activity, suggesting involvement of EGFR-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and to a lesser extent transforming growth factor-alpha, reduced imatinib-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Imatinib stimulated the rapid release of soluble HB-EGF and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound HB-EGF, which correlated with biphasic MAPK activation. Together, these results suggested that imatinib affects EGFR activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous EGFR-activating ligands. Although, imatinib primarily inhibits tyrosine kinases, it also stimulates the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients."

Seventy-nine % (27 of 34) of primary tumors and 100% (8 of 8) of medulloblastoma cell lines displayed extensive tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation across the RASSF1A promoter-associated CpG island. Hypermethylation was associated with epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A transcription in medulloblastoma cell lines, and RASSF1A expression in these lines was restored after treatment with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. No evidence was found of RASSF1A inactivation by genetic mechanisms (gene mutation or deletion) in either cases with no evidence of RASSF1A hypermethylation or paired normal/tumor cases and cell lines with evidence of total RASSF1A CpG island hypermethylation. Epigenetic inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma.

Importantly, these data demonstrate that comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma development."

Weaver syndrome, first described in 1974, is characterized by tall stature, a typical facial appearance, and variable intellectual disability. In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome. To date, we have identified 48 individuals with EZH2 mutations. The mutations were primarily missense mutations occurring throughout the gene, with some clustering in the SET domain (12/48). Truncating mutations were uncommon (4/48) and only identified in the final exon, after the SET domain. Through analyses of clinical data and facial photographs of EZH2 mutation-positive individuals, we have shown that the facial features can be subtle and the clinical diagnosis of Weaver syndrome is thus challenging, especially in older individuals. However, tall stature is very common, reported in >90% of affected individuals. Intellectual disability is also common, present in ~80%, but is highly variable and frequently mild. Additional clinical features which may help in stratifying individuals to EZH2 mutation testing include camptodactyly, soft, doughy skin, umbilical hernia, and a low, hoarse cry. Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes. As mutation testing becomes increasingly accessible and larger numbers of EZH2 mutation-positive individuals are identified, knowledge of the clinical spectrum and prognostic implications of EZH2 mutations should improve."

H-ras, N-ras, and K-ras are canonical ras gene family members frequently activated by point mutation in human cancers and coding for 4 different, highly related protein isoforms (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B). Their expression is nearly ubiquitous and broadly conserved across eukaryotic species, although there are quantitative and qualitative differences of expression depending on the tissue and/or developmental stage under consideration. Extensive functional studies have determined during the last quarter century that these Ras gene products are critical components of signaling pathways that control eukaryotic cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, because of their homology and frequent coexpression in various cellular contexts, it remained unclear whether the different Ras proteins play specific or overlapping functional roles in physiological and pathological processes. Initially, their high degree of sequence homology and the observation that all Ras isoforms share common sets of downstream effectors and upstream activators suggested that they were mostly redundant functionally. In contrast, the notion of functional specificity for each of the different Ras isoforms is supported at present by an increasing body of experimental observations, including 1) the fact that different ras isoforms are preferentially mutated in specific types of tumors or developmental disorders; 2) the different transforming potential of transfected ras genes in different cell contexts; 3) the distinct sensitivities exhibited by the various Ras family members for modulation by different GAPs or GEFs; 4) the demonstration that different Ras isoforms follow distinct intracellular processing pathways and localize to different membrane microdomains or subcellular compartments; 5) the different phenotypes displayed by genetically modified animal strains for each of the 3 ras loci; and 6) the specific transcriptional networks controlled by each isoform in different cellular settings."

Mice expressing the mutant thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1R384C, which has a 10-fold reduced affinity to the ligand T(3), exhibit hypermetabolism due to an overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. To define the consequences in the liver, we analyzed hepatic metabolism and the regulation of liver genes in the mutant mice. Our results showed that hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase was up-regulated and pyruvate kinase mRNA down-regulated, contrary to what observed after T(3) treatment. In contrast, mice expressing a mutant TRalpha1L400R specifically in the liver did not show a dysregulation of these genes; however, when the TRalpha1L400R was expressed ubiquitously, the hepatic phenotype differed from TRalpha1R384C animals, suggesting that the localization of the mutation plays an important role for its consequences on glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we observed that glycogen stores were completely depleted in TRalpha1R384C animals, despite increased gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Exposure of the mutant mice to high maternal levels of thyroid hormone during fetal development leads to a normal liver phenotype in the adult. Our results show how genetic and maternal factors interact to determine the metabolic setpoint of the offspring and indicate an important role for maternal thyroid hormone in the susceptibility to metabolic disorders in adulthood."

We studied 18 Taiwan Chinese patients with various types of craniosynostosis to evaluate if this mutation is also prevalent in the Chinese population. Genomic DNA was analysed by polymerase chain reaction based restriction analysis and direct sequencing to identify the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3. Five (28%) of 18 probands were heterozygous for the Pro250Arg mutation. Only those patients with coronal synostosis carried this mutation.

The centromeres and short arms of the human acrocentric chromosomes have in common several families of tandemly repeated DNA. Recent analyses have revealed that, within some of these families, clearly distinct subfamilies have evolved that are unique to one or a subset of the different acrocentric chromosomes. The existence and maintenance of subfamilies common to different chromosomes entail a process of regular exchange between the non-homologous chromosomes. This process is suggested for the evolution of an alpha satellite subfamily recently found on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21. The presence of this alpha subfamily may allow pairing between these chromosomes leading to the observed non-random participation of these chromosomes in t(13q14q) and t(14q21q) Robertsonian translocations. The available data also indicate a very similar molecular organisation of the cen-pter region for chromosomes 13 and 21. This latter feature may further allow the two chromosomes to undergo a relatively extensive degree of meiotic pairing (in a manner analogous to that seen in the pseudoautosomal regions of the X and Y chromosomes), thus predisposing these two chromosomes to errors in meiotic segregation and non-disjunction."

BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common health problems for children and adolescents. If not successfully treated, it can impact patients and families with significant disability due to loss of school, work, and social function. When headaches become frequent, it is essential to try to prevent the headaches. For children and adolescents, this is guided by extrapolation from adult studies, a limited number of small studies in children and adolescents and practitioner preference. The aim of the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) study is to determine the most effective preventive agent to use in children and adolescents. METHODS: CHAMP is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, comparative effectiveness study of amitriptyline and topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, designed to mirror real-world practice, sponsored by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institutes of Health (U01NS076788). The study will recruit 675 subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years old, inclusive, who have migraine with or without aura or chronic migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, with at least 4 headaches in the 28 days prior to randomization. The subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 (amitriptyline: topiramate: placebo) ratio. Doses are weight based and will be slowly titrated over an 8-week period to a target dose of 1 mg/kg of amitriptyline and 2 mg/kg of topiramate. The primary outcome will be a 50% reduction in headache frequency between the 28-day baseline and the final 28 days of treatment (weeks 20-24). CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the CHAMP study is to obtain level 1 evidence for the effectiveness of amitriptyline and topiramate in the prevention of migraine in children and adolescents. If this study proves to be positive, it will provide information to the practicing physician as how to best prevent migraine in children and adolescents and subsequently improve the disability and outcomes."

Recently, a potential association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and AF development has been proposed due to the close anatomic vicinity of the oesophagus and the left atrium. As an understanding of the association between acid reflux disease and AF may be important in the global multimodal treatment strategy to further improve outcomes in a subset of patients with AF, we discuss potential atrial arrhythmogenic mechanisms in patients with GERD, such as gastric and subsequent systemic inflammation, impaired autonomic stimulation, mechanical irritation due to anatomical proximity of the left atrium and the oesophagus, as well as common comorbidities like obesity and sleep-disordered breathing. Data on GERD and oesophageal lesions after AF-ablation procedures will be reviewed. Treatment of GERD to avoid AF or to reduce AF burden might represent a future treatment perspective but needs to be scrutinized in prospective trials."

By comparing the metabolic profiles of unstressed and stressed staphylococcal cells in a time-dependent manner, we found far-ranging effects within the metabolome. For each antibiotic compound, accumulation as well as depletion of metabolites was detected, often comprising whole biosynthetic pathways, such as central carbon and amino acid metabolism and peptidoglycan, purine, and pyrimidine synthesis. Ciprofloxacin altered the pool of (deoxy)nucleotides as well as peptidoglycan precursors, thus linking stalled DNA and cell wall synthesis. Erythromycin tended to increase the amounts of intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway and lysine. Fosfomycin inhibited the first enzymatic step of peptidoglycan synthesis, which was followed by decreased levels of peptidoglycan precursors but enhanced levels of substrates such as UDP-GlcNAc and alanine-alanine. In contrast, vancomycin and ampicillin inhibited the last stage of peptidoglycan construction on the outer cell surface. As a result, the amounts of UDP-MurNAc-peptides drastically increased, resulting in morphological alterations in the septal region and in an overall decrease in central metabolite levels. Moreover, each antibiotic affected intracellular levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates."

Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 4 (H3K4me1) and acetylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27ac) are histone modifications that are highly enriched over the body of actively transcribed genes and on enhancers. Although in yeast all H3K4 methylation patterns, including H3K4me1, are implemented by Set1/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1), there are three classes of COMPASS-like complexes in Drosophila that could carry out H3K4me1 on enhancers: dSet1, Trithorax, and Trithorax-related (Trr). Here, we report that Trr, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Mll3/4 COMPASS-like complexes, can function as a major H3K4 monomethyltransferase on enhancers in vivo. Loss of Trr results in a global decrease of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac levels in various tissues. Assays with the cut wing margin enhancer implied a functional role for Trr in enhancer-mediated processes. A genome-wide analysis demonstrated that Trr is required to maintain the H3K4me1 and H3K27ac chromatin signature that resembles the histone modification patterns described for enhancers. Furthermore, studies in the mammalian system suggested a role for the Trr homolog Mll3 in similar processes. Since Trr and mammalian Mll3/4 complexes are distinguished by bearing a unique subunit, the H3K27 demethylase UTX, we propose a model in which the H3K4 monomethyltransferases Trr/Mll3/Mll4 and the H3K27 demethylase UTX cooperate to regulate the transition from inactive/poised to active enhancers."

Upc2p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family, is an important regulator of sterol biosynthesis and azole drug resistance in Candida albicans. To better understand Upc2p function in C. albicans, we used genomewide location profiling to identify the transcriptional targets of Upc2p in vivo. A triple hemagglutinin epitope, introduced at the C terminus of Upc2p, conferred a gain-of-function effect on the fusion protein. Location profiling identified 202 bound promoters (P < 0.05). Overrepresented functional groups of genes whose promoters were bound by Upc2p included 12 genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (NCP1, ERG11, ERG2, and others), 18 genes encoding ribosomal subunits (RPS30, RPL32, RPL12, and others), 3 genes encoding drug transporters (CDR1, MDR1, and YOR1), 4 genes encoding transcription factors (INO2, ACE2, SUT1, and UPC2), and 6 genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism (MET6, SAM2, SAH1, and others). Bioinformatic analyses suggested that Upc2p binds to the DNA motif 5'-VNCGBDTR that includes the previously characterized Upc2p binding site 5'-TCGTATA. Northern blot analysis showed that increased binding correlates with increased expression for the analyzed Upc2p targets (ERG11, MDR1, CDR1, YOR1, SUT1, SMF12, and CBP1). The analysis of ERG11, MDR1, and CDR1 transcripts in wild-type and upc2Delta/upc2Delta strains grown under Upc2p-activating conditions (lovastatin treatment and hypoxia) showed that Upc2p regulates its targets in a complex manner, acting as an activator or as a repressor depending upon the target and the activating condition. Taken together, our results indicate that Upc2p is a key regulator of ergosterol metabolism. They also suggest that Upc2p may contribute to azole resistance by regulating the expression of drug efflux pump-encoding genes in addition to ergosterol biosynthesis genes."

Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4) Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO). Due to the clinical heterogeneity, time-dependent evolution of symptoms, overlapping phenotypes, and inconsistencies in muscle pathology findings, definitive diagnosis relies on the molecular finding of deleterious mutations. We sequenced the exons and flanking intron region from approximately 350 patients displaying a phenotype consistent with POLG related mitochondrial disease and found informative mutations in 61 (17%). Two mutant alleles were identified in 31 unrelated index patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders. Among them, 20 (67%) had Alpers syndrome, 4 (13%) had arPEO, and 3 (10%) had ANS. In addition, 30 patients carrying one altered POLG allele were found. A total of 25 novel alterations were identified, including 6 null mutations. We describe the predicted structural/functional and clinical importance of the previously unreported missense variants and discuss their likelihood of being pathogenic. In conclusion, sequence analysis allows the identification of mutations responsible for POLG-related disorders and, in most of the autosomal recessive cases where two mutant alleles are found in trans, finding deleterious mutations can provide an unequivocal diagnosis of the disease."

Activated oncogenes induce premature cellular senescence, a permanent state of proliferative arrest in primary rodent and human fibroblasts. Recent studies suggest that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in oncogenic Ras-induced premature senescence. However, the signaling mechanism controlling this oxidant-mediated irreversible growth arrest is not fully understood. Here, we show that through the Ras/MEK pathway, Ras oncogene up-regulated the expression of superoxide-generating oxidases, Nox1 in rat REF52 cells and Nox4 in primary human lung TIG-3 cells, leading to an increase in intracellular level of ROS. Ablation of Nox1 and Nox4 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) blocked the RasV12 senescent phenotype including \u03b2-galactosidase activity, growth arrest and accumulation of tumor suppressors such as p53 and p16Ink4a. This suggests that Nox-generated ROS transduce senescence signals by activating the p53 and p16Ink4a pathway. Furthermore, Nox1 and Nox4 siRNAs inhibited both Ras-induced DNA damage response and p38MAPK activation, whereas overexpression of Nox1 and Nox4 alone was able to induce senescence. The involvement of Nox1 in Ras-induced senescence was also confirmed with embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nox1 knockout mice. Together, these findings suggest that Nox1- and Nox4-generated ROS play an important role in Ras-induced premature senescence, which may involve DNA damage response and p38MAPK signaling pathways."

BACKGROUND: The monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA) gene plays a vital role in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, e.g, serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. A polymorphism in the promoter region (MAOA-uVNTR) affects transcriptional efficiency. Allelic variation in MAOA-uVNTR has been associated with body mass index (BMI). We extended previous work by examining relations among this polymorphism and serum lipid levels. MATERIAL/METHODS: The sample consisted of 74 males enrolled in a study of caregivers for relatives with dementia. Regression models, adjusted for age, race, group status (caregiver/control), and cholesterol lowering medication (yes/no), were used to examine associations between high verses low MAOA-uVNTR activity alleles and total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, LDL/HDL ratio, triglycerides, and BMI. RESULTS: Higher total cholesterol (p<0.03), LDL/HDL ratio (p<0.01), triglycerides (p<0.02), and VLDL (p<0.02) were associated with low activity MAOA-uVNTR alleles. HDL and LDL were modestly related to MAOA-uVNTR activity, however, they did not reach the conventional significance level (p<0.07 and p<0.10, respectively). BMI (p<0.74) was unrelated to MAOA-uVNTR transcription. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that MAOA-uVNTR may influence lipid levels and individuals with less active alleles are at increased health risk."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are intracellular mediators of essential biological functions. Recently, plasma-based 'circulating' miRNAs (c-miRNAs) have been shown to control cellular processes, but the c-miRNA response to human exercise remains unknown. We sought to determine whether c-miRNAs are dynamically regulated in response to acute exhaustive cycling exercise and sustained rowing exercise training using a longitudinal, repeated measures study design. Specifically, c-miRNAs involved in angiogenesis (miR-20a, miR-210, miR-221, miR-222, miR-328), inflammation (miR-21, miR-146a), skeletal and cardiac muscle contractility (miR-21, miR-133a), and hypoxia/ischaemia adaptation (miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-210) were measured at rest and immediately following acute exhaustive cycling exercise in competitive male rowers (n = 10, age = 19.1 \u00b1 0.6 years) before and after a 90 day period of rowing training. Distinct patterns of c-miRNA response to exercise were observed and adhered to four major profiles: (1) c-miRNA up-regulated by acute exercise before and after sustained training (miR-146a and miR-222), (2) c-miRNA responsive to acute exercise before but not after sustained training (miR-21 and miR-221), (3) c-miRNA responsive only to sustained training (miR-20a), and (4) non-responsive c-miRNA (miR-133a, miR-210, miR-328). Linear correlations were observed between peak exercise levels of miR-146a and VO2max (r = 0.63, P = 0.003) and between changes in resting miR-20a and changes in VO2max (pre-training vs. post-training, r = 0.73; P = 0.02). Although future work is required, these results suggest the potential value of c-miRNAs as exercise biomarkers and their possible roles as physiological mediators of exercise-induced cardiovascular adaptation."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear. DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation of three patient groups. SETTINGS: Disease-specific symptoms were reviewed among referred patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Finland and in members of a Finnish M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Association in Finland. The MRI of a separate group of patients was undertaken in a tertiary referral centre in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 340 patients were reviewed in the referral hospital along with 740 members of the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Association. MRI was undertaken in 224 patients in Japan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Latency and symptom development in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and the appearance of EH of the inner ear in monosymptomatic patients and in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. RESULTS: The mean age of the first symptom was 43.8 years, with 10% of the patients being older than 65 years. The time delay between hearing loss and vertigo was more than 5 years in 20% of the members and of the patients. Gadolinium-contrasted MRI demonstrated EH in 90% of the patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, in which 75% was bilateral among patients with unilateral symptoms. In monosymptomatic patients with vertigo, tinnitus or hearing loss; EH was demonstrated in 55-90% of the patients either in the cochlea and/or the vestibulum of the symptomatic ear. CONCLUSIONS: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease often shows bilateral EH and comprises a continuum from a monosymptomatic disease to the typical symptom complex of the disease. We suggest that a 3T MRI measurement should be carried out in patients with sensory-neural hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus, 4 h after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-contrast agent to verify the inner ear pathology. This may lead to a better management of the condition."

The molecular mechanism of thyroid hormone (TH) effects to fatty acid metabolism in liver is yet to be clear. The carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) as well as sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c plays a pivotal role in hepatic lipogenesis. Both SREBP-1c and ChREBP are target genes of liver X receptors (LXRs). Because LXRs and TH receptors (TRs) cross talk mutually in many aspects of transcription, we examined whether TRs regulate the mouse ChREBP gene expression. In the current study, we demonstrated that TH up-regulated mouse ChREBP mRNA and protein expression in liver. Run-on and luciferase assays showed that TH and TR-beta1 positively regulated the ChREBP gene transcription. The mouse ChREBP gene promoter contains two direct repeat-4 sites (LXRE1 and LXRE2) and EMSAs demonstrated that LXR-alpha and TR-beta1 prefer to bind LXRE1 and LXRE2, respectively. The direct repeat-4 deletion and LXRE2 mutants of the promoter deteriorate the positive regulation by TR-beta1, indicating that LXRE2 is functionally important for the regulation. We also showed that human ChREBP gene expression and promoter activities were up-regulated by TH. These data suggest that ChREBP mRNA expression is positively regulated by TR-beta1 and TH at the transcriptional level in mammals. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally."

Let-7 is shown in vitro to sensitize cancer cells to platinum, but induce ovarian cancer resistance to paclitaxel. This study aims to investigate the effect of let-7a expression on survival outcomes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with different chemotherapy. METHODS: Let-7a expression was measured with qRT-PCR in ovarian tumors of 178 EOC patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy with and without paclitaxel after surgery. Survival analysis was performed to assess the effects of let-7a and chemotherapy on disease outcomes. RESULTS: Let-7a expression was detectable in the EOC samples, but the expression was not associated with disease stage, tumor grade, histology and debulking results. Patients who responded to platinum with paclitaxel had significantly lower let-7a than those who did not. Survival analyses showed that patients with high let-7a had better survival compared to those with low let-7a when they were treated with platinum without paclitaxel. The hazards ratios (HRs) for death and disease progression were 0.52 (95% CI: 0.29-0.96) and 0.48 (0.26-0.89) for high let-7a when compared to low let-7a, respectively. However, when patients were treated with platinum and paclitaxel, high let-7a was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival. The HRs for death and disease progression were 3.87 (95% CI: 1.28-11.66) and 3.48 (95% CI: 1.25-9.67) for high let-7a when compared to low let-7a, respectively. Further studies showed that among patients with low let-7a, those treated with paclitaxel in addition to platinum survived better than those treated without paclitaxel [adjusted-HRs were 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15-0.66) for death and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22-0.75) for disease], while among those with high let-7a, the two types of treatment made no difference in patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the beneficial impact of the addition of paclitaxel on EOC survival was significantly linked to let-7a levels, and that miRNAs such as let-7a may be a useful marker for selection of chemotherapeutic agents in EOC management."

Methylation of CpG sites in the control regions of tumor suppressor genes may be an important mechanism for their heritable, yet reversible, transcriptional inactivation. These changes in methylation may impair the proper expression and/or function of cell cycle regulatory genes and confer a selective growth advantage to affected cells. Detailed methylation analysis using genomic bisulfite sequencing was performed on a series of subclones of a bladder cancer cell line in which a hypermethylated p16 gene had been reactivated by transient treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. Furthermore, we show that reactivant clones that expressed p16 at varying levels contained heterogeneous methylation patterns, suggesting that p16 expression can occur even in the presence of a relatively heavily methylated coding region. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation."

RESULTS: After a 131-month median follow-up, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.4%, 42.5%, and 43.6% (P =.05) in the three arms, respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was superior both to 3 FEC 50 (P =.02) and to 3 FEC 75 (P =.05). The 10-year overall survival (OS) for the 6 FEC 50 arm was 64.3%, for the 3 FEC 50 arm it was 56.6%, and for the 3 FEC 75 arm, it was 59.7% (P =.25), respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was more effective than 3 FEC 50 (P =.10). Cox regression analysis demonstrates that OS was significantly better in the 6 FEC 50 than in the 3 FEC 50 arm (P =.046). No severe infections (grade 3 to 4), acute cardiac toxicity, or deaths from toxicity have been observed. Only five patients developed delayed cardiac dysfunctions, and three patients developed acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: After a long-term follow-up in an adjuvant setting, the benefit of six cycles of FEC 50 compared with three cycles, whatever the dose, is highly significant in terms of DFS. As regards OS, the group receiving six cycles of FEC 50 has significantly better results than the group receiving three cycles of FEC 50."

The mammalian genome contains numerous regions known as facultative heterochromatin, which contribute to transcriptional silencing during development and cell differentiation. We have analyzed the pattern of histone modifications associated with facultative heterochromatin within the mouse imprinted Snurf-Snrpn cluster, which is homologous to the human Prader-Willi syndrome genomic region. We show here that the maternally inherited Snurf-Snrpn 3-Mb region, which is silenced by a potent transcription repressive mechanism, is uniformly enriched in histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, such as H4K20me3, H3K9me3, and H3K79me3. Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3-Mb imprinted region. We show that H3K36me3 deposition within this large heterochromatin domain does not correlate with transcription events, suggesting the existence of an alternative pathway for the deposition of this histone modification. In addition, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 is markedly enriched at the level of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. This result indicates that H3K36me3 is associated with both facultative and constitutive heterochromatin. Our data suggest that H3K36me3 function is not restricted to actively transcribed regions only and may contribute to the composition of heterochromatin, in combination with other histone modifications."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) in the detection of acquired complete and partial deletion of chromosome 5(-5/5q-) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: Marrow cells from 48 MDS patients and 10 normal controls were studied by interphase FISH using SpectrumRed directly labelled DNA specific probe for 5q31, 200 to 300 cells were scored for each case and cells with a red hybridization signal > 6% were defined as -5/5q- positive. RESULTS: In 48 MDS patients, 13 were positive for interphase FISH, of whom, 7 were positive and 6 were negative for conventional cytogenetics (CC). The difference in the percentage of positive cells detected by the two methods was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Interphase FISH is more sensitive than CC for the detection of -5/5q- in MDS."

PURPOSE: To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. METHODS: Patients underwent detailed ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal examination. This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae. Echocardiography and skeletal examination revealed no sign of systemic disorders associated with EL, in particular Marfan syndrome (MFS). Nine patients (52.9%) were found to have mutations in ADAMTSL4, including four novel nonsense mutations. Four patients (25%) were found to have novel FBN1 mutations, not previously reported as causing classical Marfan syndrome. One additional patient was found to have an FBN1 mutation previously reported in classical MFS. Four patients (25%) were found to have no mutations in either gene. Median age of diagnosis of EL was 35 years in patients with FBN1 mutations and 2 years in patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations (P < 0.01). Mean axial length was 22.74 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.3-24.2) (FBN1) and 27.54 mm (95% CI: 24.2-30.9) (ADAMTSL4) (P < 0.01). Other ophthalmic features, including corneal thickness and power, foveal thickness, visual acuity, and direction of lens displacement, were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene."

In three forms, caused by mutations in parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), or DJ-1 (PARK7), the phenotype is usually characterized by levodopa-responsive parkinsonism without atypical features. Parkin mutations are most frequent, explaining -50% of the cases with a clinical diagnosis of familial Parkinson's disease compatible with recessive inheritance and onset <45 years, and -15% of the sporadic cases with onset <45. Mutations in PINK1 and DJ-1 are less common, accounting for -1-8%, and -1-2% of the sporadic cases with early-onset. Since point mutations and genomic rearrangements can be present, sequencing and exon dosage are both required for accurate mutational screening of these genes. The phenotype of parkin mutations is characterized by early-onset parkinsonism, good response to levodopa, and benign course. The average onset age is in the 30s, but late-onset cases have been described. The phenotype associated with PINK1 and DJ-1 mutations has been studied in a smaller number of patients but it is overall indistinguishable from that of parkin. Mutations in other genes, including ATP13A2 (PARK9), PLA2G6 (PARK14), and FBX07 (PARK15), cause more rare forms of recessive parkinsonism with very early-onset (<30 years) and usually additional, atypical features (pyramidal, dystonic, ocular movement, and cognitive disturbances). Yet, it is expected that other monogenic forms of parkinsonism will be identified in the future, as mutations in the above-mentioned genes are not found in other patients with similar phenotypes."

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an almost invariably fatal, asbestos-related malignancy arising from the mesothelial membrane lining the thoracic cavities. Despite some improvements in treatment, therapy is not considered curative and median survival following diagnosis is less than 1 year. Although still classed as a rare cancer, the incidence of MPM is increasing, and the limited progress in treating the disease makes the identification of new therapies a priority. As there is evidence for expression of the integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin \u03b1v heterodimer with high specificity for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. In mesothelial cells (MC) and 7 MPM cell lines, growth inhibition by cilengitide was associated with the expression level of its target integrins. Furthermore, cilengitide caused cell detachment and subsequent death of anoikis-sensitive cells. It also suppressed invasion of MPM cells in monolayer and three-dimensional cultures. Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25."

Although regulation of histone methylation is believed to contribute to embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal, the mechanisms remain obscure. We show here that the histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me3) demethylase, KDM5B, is a downstream Nanog target and critical for ESC self-renewal. Although KDM5B is believed to function as a promoter-bound repressor, we find that it paradoxically functions as an activator of a gene network associated with self-renewal. ChIP-Seq reveals that KDM5B is predominantly targeted to intragenic regions and that it is recruited to H3K36me3 via an interaction with the chromodomain protein MRG15. Depletion of KDM5B or MRG15 increases intragenic H3K4me3, increases cryptic intragenic transcription, and inhibits transcriptional elongation of KDM5B target genes. We propose that KDM5B activates self-renewal-associated gene expression by repressing cryptic initiation and maintaining an H3K4me3 gradient important for productive transcriptional elongation."

BACKGROUND: The combined inhibition of BRAF and MEK is hypothesized to improve clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma by preventing or delaying the onset of resistance observed with BRAF inhibitors alone. This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. METHODS: We randomly assigned 495 patients with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma to receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib (combination group) or vemurafenib and placebo (control group). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination group and 6.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.68; P<0.001). The rate of complete or partial response in the combination group was 68%, as compared with 45% in the control group (P<0.001), including rates of complete response of 10% in the combination group and 4% in the control group. Progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was similar to investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Interim analyses of overall survival showed 9-month survival rates of 81% (95% CI, 75 to 87) in the combination group and 73% (95% CI, 65 to 80) in the control group. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib was associated with a nonsignificantly higher incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher, as compared with vemurafenib and placebo (65% vs. 59%), and there was no significant difference in the rate of study-drug discontinuation. The number of secondary cutaneous cancers decreased with the combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib was associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival among patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma, at the cost of some increase in toxicity.

We reviewed electrophysiological data in 20 patients with POEMS syndrome and 36 matched patients with CIDP to compare the electrophysiological features of POEMS syndrome and CIDP. Compared with CIDP controls, POEMS patients demonstrated (1) less prolonged distal motor latency and less reduced motor nerve and sensory nerve conduction velocities, (2) greater reduction of amplitudes of compound motor action potentials (CMAP) in distal stimulation, and similar reduction of amplitudes of CMAP in proximal stimulation, (3) similar reduction of amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) in median and ulnar nerves, and a greater reduction of amplitudes of SNAP in tibial and peroneal nerves, (4) less temporal dispersion, (5) less frequent conduction block, (6) more frequent neurogenic injury in the muscles of the upper and lower limbs, and more frequent neurogenic injury in the muscles of the lower than upper limbs, (7) similar F wave and H reflex abnormalities, and (8) less frequent skin sympathetic response abnormalities. We concluded that before development of typical clinical manifestations, POEMS neuropathy can be distinguished from CIDP by neural electrophysiological examination.

The chromatin organizer modifier domain (chromodomain) is present in proteins that contribute to chromatin organization and mediates their binding to methylated histone H3. Despite a high level of sequence conservation, individual chromodomains manifest substantial differences in binding preference for methylated forms of histone H3, suggesting that posttranslational modification of the chromodomain might be an important determinant of binding specificity. We now show that mouse Cbx2 (also known as M33), a homolog of Drosophila Polycomb protein, is highly phosphorylated in some cell lines. A low-mobility band of Cbx2 observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was thus converted to a higher-mobility band by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine-42, a conserved amino acid in the chromodomain, as a phosphorylation site of Cbx2. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory."

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the different fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis in adult Spanish patients with chronic periodontitis, patients with gingivitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and the relationship between these genotypes and other periodontopathogenic bacteria. STUDY DESIGN: Samples of subgingival plaque were taken from 86 patients (33 with chronic periodontitis, 16 with gingivitis, and 37 periodontally healthy) in the course of a full periodontal examination. PCR was employed to determine the presence of the 6 fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (I-V and Ib) and of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola. RESULTS: Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes II and Ib were present in significantly higher percentages in periodontal patients (39.4% and 12.1% respectively) than in healthy or gingivitis subjects. The prevalence of Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotype IV was significantly higher in the group that presented bleeding greater than 30%. A positive correlation was found between Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotype IV and Treponema denticola. CONCLUSIONS: A strong association between Porphyromonas gingivalis fimA genotypes II and Ib and chronic periodontitis exists in the Spanish population. The most prevalent genotype in periodontal patients is II."

BACKGROUND: Modifications to the age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, duration of symptoms, and diabetes (ABCD2) score, which incorporate history of hypertension and acute hyperglycemia in addition to acute blood pressure (BP) elevation and history of diabetes, have been proposed to increase the predictive value of the score. In addition, the timing of acute BP measurement may be important in the emergency department (ED) setting, given the phenomenon of \"ED triage hypertension\". METHODS: The standard ABCD2 score was compared to modified scores incorporating various combinations of acute BP elevation or hyperglycemia, history of hypertension or diabetes, and subsequent versus initial ED BP measurements. The number of patients reclassified into an alternate risk category (low/moderate/high) with different schemes was determined. Predictive value using the composite outcome of stroke, death, or high-risk transient ischemic attack mechanism was assessed using c statistics. RESULTS: Modified ABCD2 scores resulted in few patients shifting risk categories (between 2% and 10% for six alternate schemes), and did not improve the performance of the ABCD2 score (c-statistics, 0.61-0.65, compared to 0.63 for the standard score). ED triage hypertension was frequent (mean systolic blood pressure [SBP]/diastolic blood pressure [DBP] decrease of 8/9 mm Hg on subsequent measurement; P < .001), but the use of second BP did not reclassify many patients (10%) nor did it improve score performance (c-statistic, 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of the ABCD2 score changed the risk category for few patients and did not improve the overall predictive value of the score."

          "context": "The exosome component Rrp6 is required for RNA polymerase II termination at specific targets of the Nrd1-Nab3 pathway. The exosome and its nuclear specific subunit Rrp6 form a 3'-5' exonuclease complex that regulates diverse aspects of RNA biology including 3' end processing and degradation of a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and unstable transcripts. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism. NNS-dependent termination is coupled to RNA 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of ncRNA transcripts including CUTs. To determine the role of Rrp6 in NNS termination globally, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on total RNA and perform ChIP-exo analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) localization. Deletion of RRP6 promotes hyper-elongation of multiple NNS-dependent transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in RNAPII termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known NNS targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at CUTs. Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the NNS complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end RNA processing and/or degradation at specific targets."

The test performance of this microarray was evaluated with 95 Enterobacteriaceae isolates suspected of being carbapenemase producers, i.e. with meropenem MICs > 0.5 mg l(-1). The collection of isolates contained 70 carbapenemase-producing isolates, including 37 bla(KPC)-, 20 bla(VIM)-, five bla(OXA-48)-, four bla(KPC)/bla(VIM)- and four bla(NDM)-positive isolates; and 25 carbapenemase-gene-negative isolates. ESBLs were produced by 51 of the isolates. PCR and sequencing of \u03b2-lactamase genes was used as reference test. For detection of carbapenemases, the sensitivity of the microarray was 97% (68/70), with 100% specificity. The two negative isolates tested positive when the microarray test was repeated; these isolates were an OXA-48- and a KPC-producing isolate. For ESBL detection, the sensitivity was 100% (51/51) and the specificity was 98% (43/44), although 20% of the SHV-12 ESBLs were categorized as SHV-2-like ESBLs. In conclusion, the CDT102 microarray is a rapid and accurate tool for the detection of carbapenemase and ESBL genes, although the array seems less suitable for epidemiology of ESBL genes."

They are present in the form of specialized organs, such as the pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, and adrenal gland, or in the form of the diffuse neuroendocrine system in the respiratory and digestive tracts. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, yet they present certain unifying features. These include frequent hormonal overproduction that leads to specific symptoms and a typical immunohistochemical staining profile with chromogranin A and synaptophysin reactivity. Over the past decades, many neuroendocrine tumors have been described in the context of heritable tumor syndromes, and there exist several syndromes that are almost entirely composed of neuroendocrine tumors. Tumors occurring as part of these hereditary syndromes are characterized by specific genetic abnormalities that have helped our understanding of tumorigenesis, and they frequently appear at a young age. It is therefore important for the pediatric pathologist to be aware of specific histologic characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors in childhood and of their association with specific tumor syndromes. This may alert other clinicians to the possibility of multiple tumors in the patient or his family members. This review focuses on hereditary syndromes with neuroendocrine tumors, including multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Carney complex, pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome, and familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma. In addition, several individual neuroendocrine tumors are described, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, gastroenteropancreatic tumors, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma, emphasizing specific histopathologic characteristics."

BACKGROUND: Clinical data showed promising antitumour activity with feasible tolerability for matuzumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) chemotherapy in untreated advanced oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of matuzumab plus ECX versus ECX alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised open-label phase II study, 72 patients with metastatic OG cancer were randomly assigned to either 800 mg matuzumab weekly plus epirubicin 50 mg/m\u00b2, cisplatin 60 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1 and capecitabine 1250 mg/m\u00b2 daily in a 21-day cycle (ECX) or the same ECX regimen alone. The primary end point was objective response. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life, safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Following random assignment, 35 patients (median age 59 years) received ECX/matuzumab and 36 patients (median age 64 years) ECX. The addition of matuzumab to ECX did not improve objective response: 31% for ECX/matuzumab [95% confidence interval (CI) 17-49] compared with 58% for the ECX arm (95% CI 41-74) P = 0.994 (one sided). There was no significant difference in median PFS: 4.8 months (95% CI 2.9-8.1) for ECX/matuzumab versus 7.1 months (95% CI 4.4-8.5) for ECX, or in median OS: 9.4 months (95% CI 7.5-16.2), compared with 12.2 months (95% CI 9.8-13.8 months). Grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicity was observed in 27 and 25 patients in the ECX/matuzumab and ECX groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Matuzumab 800 mg weekly combined with ECX chemotherapy does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced OG cancer. Therefore, ECX/matuzumab should not be examined further in phase III trials."

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA (miRNA) are recognized as important regulators of a variety of fundamental biologic processes. Previously, we described increased expression of miR-155 and miR-146a in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and showed a repressive effect of miR-155 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). The present study was undertaken to examine alterations in expression of miR-203 in RASFs and analyze its role in fibroblast activation. METHODS: Differentially expressed miRNA in RASFs versus osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening of 260 individual miRNA. Transfection of miR-203 precursor was used to analyze the function of miR-203 in RASFs. Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and MMPs were measured by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RASFs were stimulated with IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and 5-azacytidine (5-azaC). Activity of I\u03baB kinase 2 was inhibited with SC-514. RESULTS: Expression of miR-203 was higher in RASFs than in OASFs or fibroblasts from healthy donors. Levels of miR-203 did not change upon stimulation with IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, or LPS; however, DNA demethylation with 5-azaC increased the expression of miR-203. Enforced expression of miR-203 led to significantly increased levels of MMP-1 and IL-6. Induction of IL-6 by miR-203 overexpression was inhibited by blocking of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Basal expression levels of IL-6 correlated with basal expression levels of miR-203. CONCLUSION: The current results demonstrate methylation-dependent regulation of miR-203 expression in RASFs. Importantly, they also show that elevated levels of miR-203 lead to increased secretion of MMP-1 and IL-6 via the NF-\u03baB pathway and thereby contribute to the activated phenotype of synovial fibroblasts in RA."

BACKGROUND: Deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures (DOORS) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of unknown cause. We aimed to identify the genetic basis of this syndrome by sequencing most coding exons in affected individuals. METHODS: Through a search of available case studies and communication with collaborators, we identified families that included at least one individual with at least three of the five main features of the DOORS syndrome: deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures. Participants were recruited from 26 centres in 17 countries. Families described in this study were enrolled between Dec 1, 2010, and March 1, 2013. Collaborating physicians enrolling participants obtained clinical information and DNA samples from the affected child and both parents if possible. We did whole-exome sequencing in affected individuals as they were enrolled, until we identified a candidate gene, and Sanger sequencing to confirm mutations. We did expression studies in human fibroblasts from one individual by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, and in mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. FINDINGS: 26 families were included in the study. We did exome sequencing in the first 17 enrolled families; we screened for TBC1D24 by Sanger sequencing in subsequent families. We identified TBC1D24 mutations in 11 individuals from nine families (by exome sequencing in seven families, and Sanger sequencing in two families). 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations. More information is needed to understand the cellular roles of TBC1D24 and identify the genes responsible for DOORS phenotypes in individuals who do not have a mutation in TBC1D24.

Thus, we investigated whether blockage of the ETR pathways using the dual ETR antagonist macitentan combined with taxol or cisplatinum can produce therapy for orthotopically growing multidrug-resistant (MDR) human ovarian carcinoma. In several studies, nude mice were injected in the peritoneal cavity with HeyA8-MDR human ovarian cancer cells. Ten days later, mice were randomized to receive vehicle (saline), macitentan (oral, daily), taxol (intraperitoneal, weekly), cisplatinum (intraperitoneal, weekly), macitentan plus taxol, or macitentan plus cisplatinum. Moribund mice were killed, and tumors were collected, weighed, and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. The HeyA8-MDR tumors did not respond to taxol, cisplatinum, or macitentan administered as single agents. In contrast, combination therapy with macitentan and taxol or macitentan and cisplatinum significantly decreased the tumor incidence and weight and significantly increased the survival of mice and their general condition. Multiple immunohistochemical analyses revealed that treatment with macitentan and macitentan plus taxol or cisplatinum inhibited the phosphorylation of ETRs, decreased the levels of pVEGFR2, pAkt, and pMAPK in tumor cells after 2 weeks of treatment and induced a first wave of apoptosis in tumor-associated endothelial cells followed by apoptosis in surrounding tumor cells. Our study shows that ovarian cancer cells, which express the endothelin axis and are multidrug resistant, are exquisitely sensitive to treatment with a dual ET antagonist and can be resensitized to both taxol and cisplatinum. This combined therapy led to a significant reduction in tumor weight."

The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets. We detected a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome. Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome, is key to megakaryocyte and platelet development."

We conducted a retrospective review of 111 patients with REF DLBCL treated between 1999 and 2007. Primary treatment consisted of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP; 66%) and rituximab with CHOP (R-CHOP; 33%); 14% received involved field radiation.

Outcomes in patients with REF DLBCL after CHOP or R-CHOP appear equally poor. Second-generation platinum-containing regimens (ESHAP, GDP) may be superior to DHAP in this setting. Novel, prospectively evaluated treatment approaches should be pursued in REF DLBCL."

The rapidly growing collection of diverse genome-scale data from multiple tumor types sheds light on various aspects of the underlying tumor biology. With the objective to identify genes of importance for breast tumorigenesis in men and to enable comparisons with genes important for breast cancer development in women, we applied the computational framework COpy Number and EXpression In Cancer (CONEXIC) to detect candidate driver genes among all altered passenger genes. Unique to this approach is that each driver gene is associated with several gene modules that are believed to be altered by the driver. Thirty candidate drivers were found in the male breast cancers and 67 in the female breast cancers. We identified many known drivers of breast cancer and other types of cancer, in the female dataset (e.g. GATA3, CCNE1, GRB7, CDK4). In contrast, only three known cancer genes were found among male breast cancers; MAP2K4, LHP, and ZNF217. Many of the candidate drivers identified are known to be involved in processes associated with tumorigenesis, including proliferation, invasion and differentiation. One of the modules identified in male breast cancer was regulated by THY1, a gene involved in invasion and related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, men with THY1 positive breast cancers had significantly inferior survival. THY1 may thus be a promising novel prognostic marker for male breast cancer. Another module identified among male breast cancers, regulated by SPAG5, was closely associated with proliferation. Our data indicate that male and female breast cancers display highly different landscapes of candidate driver genes, as only a few genes were found in common between the two. Consequently, the pathobiology of male breast cancer may differ from that of female breast cancer and can be associated with differences in prognosis; men diagnosed with breast cancer may consequently require different management and treatment strategies than women."

Although regulation of histone methylation is believed to contribute to embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal, the mechanisms remain obscure. We show here that the histone H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (H3K4me3) demethylase, KDM5B, is a downstream Nanog target and critical for ESC self-renewal. Although KDM5B is believed to function as a promoter-bound repressor, we find that it paradoxically functions as an activator of a gene network associated with self-renewal. ChIP-Seq reveals that KDM5B is predominantly targeted to intragenic regions and that it is recruited to H3K36me3 via an interaction with the chromodomain protein MRG15. Depletion of KDM5B or MRG15 increases intragenic H3K4me3, increases cryptic intragenic transcription, and inhibits transcriptional elongation of KDM5B target genes. We propose that KDM5B activates self-renewal-associated gene expression by repressing cryptic initiation and maintaining an H3K4me3 gradient important for productive transcriptional elongation."

IMPORTANCE: Narrowband UV-B (NB-UV-B) phototherapy is used extensively to treat vitiligo. Afamelanotide, an analogue of \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, is known to induce tanning of the skin. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy for generalized vitiligo consisting of afamelanotide implant and NB-UV-B phototherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was performed in 2 academic outpatient dermatology centers and 1 private dermatology practice. We enrolled men and women 18 years or older with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (SPTs) III to VI and a confirmed diagnosis of nonsegmental vitiligo that involved 15% to 50% of total body surface area. Vitiligo was stable or slowly progressive for 3 months. Patients were randomized to combination therapy (n = 28) vs NB-UV-B monotherapy (n = 27). After 1 month of NB-UV-B phototherapy, 16 mg of afamelanotide was administered subcutaneously to the combination therapy group monthly for 4 months while NB-UV-B phototherapy continued; the other group continued to receive NB-UV-B monotherapy. INTERVENTIONS: Narrowband UV-B monotherapy vs combined NB-UV-B phototherapy and afamelanotide. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Response on the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index and Vitiligo European Task Force scoring system. RESULTS: Response in the combination therapy group was superior to that in the NB-UV-B monotherapy group (P < .05) at day 56. For the face and upper extremities, a significantly higher percentage of patients in the combination therapy group achieved repigmentation, and at earlier times (face, 41.0 vs 61.0 days [P = .001]; upper extremities, 46.0 vs 69.0 days [P = .003]). In the combination therapy group, repigmentation was 48.64% (95% CI, 39.49%-57.80%) at day 168 vs 33.26% (95% CI, 24.18%-42.33%) in the NB-UV-B monotherapy group. Notable adverse events included erythema in both groups and minor infections and nausea in the combination therapy group. Comparison between Fitzpatrick SPTs showed patients with SPTs IV to VI in the combination therapy group had improvement in the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index at days 56 and 84 (P < .05); no significant difference was noted in patients with SPT III. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A combination of afamelanotide implant and NB-UV-B phototherapy resulted in clinically apparent, statistically significant superior and faster repigmentation compared with NB-UV-B monotherapy. The response was more noticeable in patients with SPTs IV to VI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01430195."

INTRODUCTION: For more than 50 years the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide has been the drug of choice in the symptomatic therapy for myasthenia gravis. The sustained-release dosage form of pyridostigmine (SR-Pyr) is only available in a limited number of countries (e.g. in the United States and Germany). Astonishingly, the therapeutic usefulness of SR-Pyr has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: In this non-interventional prospective open-label trial, 72 patients with stable myasthenia gravis were switched from instant-release dosage forms of pyridostigmine bromide to SR-Pyr. The results from the 37 patients younger than 60 years were separately analyzed. RESULTS: The initial daily dose of SR-Pyr was 288.1 \u00b1 171.0mg. The drug switch was unproblematic in all patients. The number of daily doses was significantly reduced from 4.3 to 3.6 (p=0.011). The switch to SR-Pyr ameliorated the total quantified myasthenia gravis (QMG) score from 0.9 \u00b1 0.5 to 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 (p<0.001) in all patients and in the younger subgroup. This was accompanied by a significant improvement in the quality of life parameters. The health status valued by EuroQoL questionnaire improved from 0.626 \u00b1 0.286 to 0.782 \u00b1 0.186 (p<0.001). After switching to SR-Pyr, 28 adverse reactions disappeared and 24 adverse reactions occurred less frequent or weaker, however, 17 new adverse reactions were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the usefulness of SR-Pyr in an individualized therapeutic regimen to improve quality of life regardless of the patient's age in myasthenia gravis."

With the exception of a FKBP10 mutation in the BS case, all changes are novel. Of note, insertion of an AluYb8 repetitive element was detected in exon 6 of SERPINF1.

The classical triad of recurrent facial paralysis, swelling of the face, lips and deep furrowed tongue (Lingua Plicata) is seen in very few cases, majority of the patients often present with one or two symptoms only, which often leads to misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Clinically these symptoms vary from days to years, which further delay the definitive diagnosis and symptoms may eventually become permanent. The cause of this entity is not very well understood, but thought to be attributable to multiple entities including genetic and Infectious. As this entity has been associated with numerous other clinical entities, diagnosis often remains an exclusion process. METHODS: A middle age male with a chronic history of heavy eyelids with skin indurations predominately around left eye was presented to ophthalmology clinic. Physical examination revealed a deep furrowed tongue. The skin biopsy from left eyelid revealed a non-specific granulomatous lesion. The clinical correlation of facial swelling and deep plicated tongue prompted the differential of MRS Results: Histologically a non-specific granulomatous lesion was seen in dermis. As a rule, other causes of granulomatous diseases were ruled out especially Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis. Polarization failed to reveal any foreign body. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of granulomatous lesion and clinical picture led to the definite diagnosis of Melkerrson-Rosenthal syndrome. Association with rosacea was other findings.

Therefore, iPS cells represent a powerful tool for the study of gene function. In this study, we have investigated whether iPS cells derived from Cdyl-/- and Cdyl+/+ fibroblasts have different characteristics. Our results showed that both Cdyl-/- and Cdyl+/+ fibroblasts could be induced to become iPS cells, but the spontaneous neuronal differentiation capacity of Cdyl-/- iPS cells was much greater than that of the Cdyl+/+ iPS cells. These results provide some insight into the molecular function of the Cdyl gene, showing that it inhibited the neuronal differentiation of iPS cells."

PURPOSE: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, progressive, frequently lethal cystic lung disease that almost exclusively affects women. Prognostic information in LAM has been limited by small numbers and heterogeneous study methodology. Early retrospective cohorts cited 5- and 10-year mortality of 40 and 80 %, respectively. More recently, mortality at 10 years has been estimated to be approximately 10-20 % from the onset of symptoms and 30 % at 10 years from the time of lung biopsy but varies widely in individual patients. Given the heterogeneous disease course, it would be useful to establish which clinical characteristics are associated with survival to develop prediction models for disease outcome. METHODS: The LAM Foundation maintains a population-based registry of 1,149 registered self-identified LAM patients. Of these, 590 have completed a \"General Information/Clinical History Questionnaire\" with limited demographic and clinical data, 410 of whom were identified as U.S. residents and provided date of birth. Vital status was obtained on all 410 participants through December 31, 2007 by linking patient identifiers and the National Death Index. Survival time was calculated as the time since first lung-related symptom or physician diagnosis until censoring (still alive, received lung transplant, or died). Cox proportional hazard analysis evaluated the association of demographic and clinical features with survival. RESULTS: Among the 410 subjects, there were 50 deaths and 55 lung transplantations during a median of 10.4 years of observation time. The estimated median transplant-free survival time for LAM patients in the United States is 29 years from symptom onset and 23 years from diagnosis. The estimated 10-year survival transplant-free was 86 %. Age at disease onset, smoking status, race, presence of tuberous sclerosis, occurrence of pneumothorax, and pregnancy did not demonstrate an association with survival or transplant. Greater age at presentation and presence of angiomyolipoma were associated with less risk of mortality. Treatment with hormonal therapy was associated with an increased risk of death/transplant (hazard ratio (HR) 2.93; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.54-5.58; p = 0.001), particularly progesterone therapy (HR 2.17; 95 % CI 1.26-3.75, p = 0.005), and may represent confounding by indication. Patients who required oxygen therapy had a worse outcome (HR 4.53; 95 % CI 2.76-7.42; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based study showed that the median survival in patients with LAM from the onset of symptoms or diagnosis is much longer than previously described. This has important implications for life choices and treatment decisions regarding medication use and lung transplantation for patients with LAM."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs representing one of the most exciting areas of modern medical science. miRNAs modulate a large and complex regulatory network of gene expression of the majority of the protein-coding genes. Currently, evidences suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Some miRNAs as miR-1, miR-133 and miR-208a are highly expressed in the heart and strongly associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. The differential regulation of miRNAs in response to exercise suggests a potential value of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers of physiological mediators of the cardiovascular adaptation induced by exercise. Likewise, serum levels of c-miRNAs such as miR-423-5p have been evaluated as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. On the other hand, the manipulation of miRNAs levels using techniques such as 'miR mimics' and 'antagomiRs' is becoming evident the enormous potential of miRNAs as promising therapeutic strategies in heart failure."

Recent publications suggest that the Parkinson's disease- (PD-) related PINK1/Parkin pathway promotes elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy. We used tandem affinity purification (TAP), SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry as a first step towards identification of possible substrates for PINK1. The cellular abundance of selected identified interactors was investigated by Western blotting. Furthermore, one candidate gene was sequenced in 46 patients with atypical PD. In addition to two known binding partners (HSP90, CDC37), 12 proteins were identified using the TAP assay; four of which are mitochondrially localized (GRP75, HSP60, LRPPRC, and TUFM). Western blot analysis showed no differences in cellular abundance of these proteins comparing PINK1 mutant and control fibroblasts. When sequencing LRPPRC, four exonic synonymous changes and 20 polymorphisms in noncoding regions were detected. Our study provides a list of putative PINK1 binding partners, confirming previously described interactions, but also introducing novel mitochondrial proteins as potential components of the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway."

An important SOL feature is the single- or multi-processor performance for up to hundreds of CPUs. DISCORE improves the binding energy scoring by the local energy optimization of the ligand docked pose and a simple linear regression on the base of available experimental data. The docking program SOL has demonstrated a good ability for correct ligand positioning in the active sites of the tested proteins in most cases of CSAR exercises.

We screened for the presence of LVNC and related clinical characteristics in a 5-generation Chinese family. METHODS: Comprehensive medical history was obtained from 40 members in a 5-generation Chinese family. Systemic clinical investigations including echocardiography (UCG), routine and ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), X-rays were performed in 33 family members. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance image (MRI) was carried out in 2 family members. RESULTS: Sudden cardiac death (including 1 occurred while following-up) was reported in 7 family members (17.5%, 7/40). LVNC was diagnosed in 10 out of the 33 family members (30.3%) and heart enlargement was evidenced in 3, heart failure in 2, complete left branch conductive block in 3, serious sick sinus syndrome (SSS) treated with permanent pacemaker implantation in 1 and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation procedure in 1 out of these 10 LVNC patients. Primary pedigree analysis revealed that offspring from female patients were at the highest risk to be affected by LVNC (15/18, 83.3%) while LVNC was absent in offspring of male LVNC patients (0/8). Moreover, clinical heart failure symptoms and arrhythmias were more severe in female LVNC patients than in male LVNC patients. CONCLUSION: Primary familial investigation reveals the matrilineal inheritance of familial LVNC in this 5-generation Chinese family, further investigations are warranted to explore the potential mutations in the mitochondrial genome responsible for LVNC in this family."

Members of the 2-aminobenzamide class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors show promise as therapeutics for the neurodegenerative diseases Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and Huntington's disease (HD). While it is clear that HDAC3 is one of the important targets of the 2-aminobenzamide HDAC inhibitors, inhibition of other class I HDACs (HDACs 1 and 2) may also be involved in the beneficial effects of these compounds in FRDA and HD, and other HDAC interacting proteins may be impacted by the compound. To this end, we synthesized activity-based profiling probe (ABPP) versions of one of our HDAC inhibitors (compound 106), and in the present study we used a quantitative proteomic method coupled with multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to identify the proteins captured by the ABPP 106 probe. Nuclear proteins were extracted from FRDA patient iPSC-derived neural stem cells, and then were reacted with control and ABPP 106 probe. After reaction, the bound proteins were digested on the beads, and the peptides were modified using stable isotope-labeled formaldehyde to form dimethyl amine. The selectively bound proteins determined by mass spectrometry were subjected to functional and pathway analysis. Our findings suggest that the targets of compound 106 are involved not only in transcriptional regulation but also in posttranscriptional processing of mRNA."

Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin. To better understand the role of triadin 1 in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive protein expression. The protein was overexpressed 5-fold in mouse ventricles, and overexpression was accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy. The levels of two other junctional SR proteins, the ryanodine receptor and junctin, were reduced by 55% and 73%, respectively, in association with triadin 1 overexpression, whereas the levels of calsequestrin, the Ca(2+)-binding protein of junctional SR, and of phospholamban and SERCA2a, Ca(2+)-handling proteins of the free SR, were unchanged. Cardiac myocytes from triadin 1-overexpressing mice exhibited depressed contractility; Ca(2+) transients decayed at a slower rate, and cell shortening and relengthening were diminished. The extent of depression of cell shortening of triadin 1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes was rate-dependent, being more depressed under low stimulation frequencies (0.5 Hz), but reaching comparable levels at higher frequencies of stimulation (5 Hz). Spontaneously beating, isolated work-performing heart preparations overexpressing triadin 1 also relaxed at a slower rate than control hearts, and failed to adapt to increased afterload appropriately. The fast time inactivation constant, tau(1), of the l-type Ca(2+) channel was prolonged in transgenic cardiomyocytes. Our results provide evidence for the coordinated regulation of junctional SR protein expression in heart independent of free SR protein expression, and furthermore suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling."

BACKGROUND: Proliferation markers and profiles have been recommended for guiding the choice of systemic treatments for breast cancer. However, the best molecular marker or test to use has not yet been identified. We did this study to identify factors that drive proliferation and its associated features in breast cancer and assess their association with clinical outcomes and response to chemotherapy. METHODS: We applied an artificial neural network-based integrative data mining approach to data from three cohorts of patients with breast cancer (the Nottingham discovery cohort (n=171), Uppsala cohort (n=249), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium [METABRIC] cohort; n=1980). We then identified the genes with the most effect on other genes in the resulting interactome map. Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) featured prominently in our interactome map of proliferation and we chose to take it forward in our analysis on the basis of its fundamental role in the function and dynamic regulation of mitotic spindles, mitotic progression, and chromosome segregation fidelity. We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), Nottingham early stage oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT; n=697), the Nottingham anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-NeoACT; n=200), the MD Anderson taxane plus anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (MD Anderson-NeoACT; n=508), and the multicentre phase 2 neoadjuvant clinical trial cohort (phase 2 NeoACT; NCT00455533; n=253). FINDINGS: In the METABRIC cohort, we detected SPAG5 gene gain or amplification at the Ch17q11.2 locus in 206 (10%) of 1980 patients overall, 46 (19%) of 237 patients with a PAM50-HER2 phenotype, and 87 (18%) of 488 patients with PAM50-LumB phenotype. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b750, 95% CI 1\u00b718-1\u00b792, p=0\u00b700010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b740-2\u00b701, p<0\u00b70001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b732-2\u00b712, p<0\u00b70001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020). In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b720-0\u00b760, p=0\u00b70010). Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7031). In multivariable analysis, both high SPAG5 transcript and high SPAG5 protein concentrations were independent predictors for a higher proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response after combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: OR 1\u00b771, 95% CI, 1\u00b707-2\u00b774, p=0\u00b7024; Nottingham-ACT: 8\u00b775, 2\u00b742-31\u00b762, p=0\u00b70010). INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA (miRNA) is an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs that act as gene regulators. Recent studies have suggested that miRNA deregulation is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancer. However, information about cancer-related miRNA is mostly limited to tissue miRNA. The aim of this study was to find specific profiles of serum-derived miRNAs of ovarian cancer based on a comparative study using a miRNA microarray of serum, tissue, and ascites. METHODS: From 2 ovarian cancer patients and a healthy control, total RNA was isolated from their serum, tissue, and ascites, respectively, and analyzed by a microarray. Under the comparative study of each miRNA microarray, we sorted out several miRNAs showing a consistent regulation tendency throughout all 3 specimens and the greatest range of alteration in serum as potential biomarkers. The availability of biomarkers was confirmed by qRT-PCR of 18 patients and 12 controls. RESULTS: Out of 2222 kinds of total miRNAs that were identified in the microarray analysis, 95 miRNAs were down-regulated and 88 miRNAs were up-regulated, in the serum, tissue, and ascites of cancer patients. Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls. Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145) out of 5 selected miRNAs were significantly underexpressed in the serum of ovarian cancer patients in qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer. Also, serum miRNAs is a promising and useful tool for discriminating between controls and patients with serous ovarian cancer."

Despite some improvements in treatment, therapy is not considered curative and median survival following diagnosis is less than 1 year. Although still classed as a rare cancer, the incidence of MPM is increasing, and the limited progress in treating the disease makes the identification of new therapies a priority. As there is evidence for expression of the integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin \u03b1v heterodimer with high specificity for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. In mesothelial cells (MC) and 7 MPM cell lines, growth inhibition by cilengitide was associated with the expression level of its target integrins. Furthermore, cilengitide caused cell detachment and subsequent death of anoikis-sensitive cells. It also suppressed invasion of MPM cells in monolayer and three-dimensional cultures. Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25."

METHODS: We conducted two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of subcutaneous implants containing 16 mg of afamelanotide. Patients in the European Union (74 patients) and the United States (94 patients) were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a subcutaneous implant containing either afamelanotide or placebo every 60 days (a total of five implants in the European Union study and three in the U.S study). The type and duration of sun exposure, number and severity of phototoxic reactions, and adverse events were recorded over the respective 180-day and 270-day study periods. Quality of life was assessed with the use of validated questionnaires. A subgroup of U.S. patients underwent photoprovocation testing. The primary efficacy end point was the number of hours of direct exposure to sunlight without pain. RESULTS: In the U.S. study, the duration of pain-free time after 6 months was longer in the afamelanotide group (median, 69.4 hours, vs. 40.8 hours in the placebo group; P=0.04). In the European Union study, the duration of pain-free time after 9 months was also longer in the afamelanotide group than in the placebo group (median, 6.0 hours vs. 0.8 hours; P=0.005), and the number of phototoxic reactions was lower in the the afamelanotide group (77 vs. 146, P=0.04). In both trials, quality of life improved with afamelanotide therapy. Adverse events were mostly mild; serious adverse events were not thought to be related to the study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Afamelanotide had an acceptable side-effect and adverse-event profile and was associated with an increased duration of sun exposure without pain and improved quality of life in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria.

One hundred and thirty-six women were randomly allocated, to one of three treatment regimens: DTX 100 plus FEC 75, alternated for eight courses (ALT); four courses of DTX 100 followed by four courses of FEC 75 (SEQ T); or four courses of FEC 75 followed by four courses of DTX 100 (SEQ F). One hundred and thirty-one women were evaluable for tumour response. Although the treatment outcome was equivalent in the two sequential arms and the alternating regimen (P=0.110, not significant), the response rate was less encouraging in the SEQ F arm (52.3%) than in the other two arms (71.1% for ALT and 70.5% for SEQ T), in which docetaxel was administered first. Time to progression was similar in the ALT, SEQ T and SEQ F arms (9.5, 9.3 and 10.4 months respectively). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in nearly all patients; febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% (ALT), 16% (SEQ T) and 2% (SEQ F) of patients. Few patients (< or =9%) developed grade 3-4 non-haematological toxicities. Relative dose intensity was 97-99% for all regimens. All treatment regimens were active and well tolerated."

Ear, nose and throat symptoms and signs were studied in 15 patients with Kartagener's syndrome: a triad consisting of chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic bronchitis with bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. The triad is caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia and characterized by absent or considerably reduced mucociliary transport. Daily accumulation of secretions in the nose, chronic recurrent secretory otitis media and sinusitis occurred in all subjects. Characteristically, nasal discharge started at birth or was first detected in early childhood. Apparently, the frequency of common colds and of acute purulent otitis media was not increased. As primary ciliary dyskinesia can occur without situs inversus, knowledge of the typical ENT symptoms is essential for making an early diagnosis, which is important for the correct management of the disease. While a conservative surgical approach to treatment of the ENT symptoms is recommended, early and active treatment of the bronchial symptoms is probably important for prevention of further lung damage and development of bronchiectasis."

Over the prior 4 months, she had had a productive cough, fevers, night sweats, and an unintentional 30-pound weight loss. Physical examination revealed a left facial droop involving the forehead, cheek, and chin with an inability to close the left eyelid. Her serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was twice the upper limit of normal. Prominent hilar markings were identified on chest x-ray, but no focal opacity was seen. Fine-needle aspiration of a preauricular lymph node revealed noncaseating granulomas consistent with granulomatous lymphangitis. The patient was given a diagnosis of Heerfordt-Waldenstr\u00f6m syndrome, or uveoparotid fever.

MOTIVATION: Transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins are embedded in the outer membranes of mitochondria, Gram-negative bacteria and chloroplasts. These proteins perform critical functions, including active ion-transport and passive nutrient intake. Therefore, there is a need for accurate prediction of secondary and tertiary structure of TMB proteins. Traditional homology modeling methods, however, fail on most TMB proteins since very few non-homologous TMB structures have been determined. Yet, because TMB structures conform to specific construction rules that restrict the conformational space drastically, it should be possible for methods that do not depend on target-template homology to be applied successfully. RESULTS: We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. Using the transFold dataset TMBpro predicts secondary structure with per-residue accuracy (Q(2)) of 77.8%, a correlation coefficient of 0.54, and TMBpro predicts beta-contacts with precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.67. Using the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts secondary structure with Q(2) of 88.3% and a correlation coefficient of 0.75. All of these performance results exceed previously published results by 4% or more. Working with the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts the tertiary structure of transmembrane segments with RMSD <6.0 A for 9 of 14 proteins. For 6 of 14 predictions, the RMSD is <5.0 A, with a GDT_TS score greater than 60.0. AVAILABILITY: http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/psss.html."

Balanced carriers of t(11;22) usually manifest no clinical symptoms, and are often identified after the birth of offspring with an unbalanced form of this translocation, known as Emanuel syndrome. To determine the prevalence of the disorder, we sent surveillance questionnaires to 735 core hospitals in Japan. The observed number of Emanuel syndrome cases was 36 and that of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 40. On the basis of the de novo t(11;22) translocation frequency in sperm from healthy men, we calculated the frequency of the translocations in the general population. Accordingly, the prevalence of Emanuel syndrome was estimated at 1 in 110,000. Based on this calculation, the estimated number of Emanuel syndrome cases in Japan is 1063 and of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 16,604, which are much higher than the numbers calculated from the questionnaire responses. It is possible that this discordance is partly attributable to a lack of disease identification. Further efforts should be made to increase the awareness of Emanuel syndrome to ensure a better quality of life for affected patients and their families."

UNLABELLED: H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras regulate cellular growth and survival and are often activated by somatic mutation in human tumors. Although oncogenic lesions occur in a single Ras isoform within individual tumors, it is unclear whether the remaining wild-type isoforms play supporting roles in tumor growth. Here, we show that oncogenic and wild-type Ras isoforms play independent and nonredundant roles within the cell. Oncogenic Ras regulates basal effector pathway signaling, whereas wild-type Ras mediates signaling downstream of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). We show that both are necessary for exponential growth of Ras-mutant cell lines. Furthermore, we show that oncogenic Ras desensitizes signaling from EGF receptor (EGFR). Depletion of oncogenic Ras with siRNA oligonucleotides relieves this negative feedback, leading to the hyperactivation of EGFR and wild-type Ras signaling. Consistent with this model, combining oncogenic Ras depletion with EGFR inhibition potently increases cell death. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study highlight a novel role for wild-type Ras signaling in cancer cells harboring oncogenic RAS mutations. Furthermore, these findings reveal that therapeutically targeting oncogenic Ras signaling alone may be ineffective owing to feedback activation of RTKs, and suggest that blocking upstream RTKs in combination with downstream effector pathways may be beneficial in the treatment of Ras-mutant tumors."

There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. The features of the speech disturbance of these six major types of dysarthria are distinctive and can assist with diagnosis. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom of many neurological conditions and is commonly associated with progressive neurological disease. It has a profound effect upon the patient and their families as communication is integrally related with expressing personality and social relationships. Speech and language therapy can be used to encourage the person to use the speech that is already available to them more effectively, can increase the range and consistency of sound production, can teach strategies for improving intelligibility and communicative effectiveness, can guide the individual to use methods that are less tiring and more successful, and can introduce the appropriate Augmentative and Alternative Communication approaches as and when required."

METHODS: Data were extracted from the original reports (study level) and a meta-analysis was carried out. RESULTS: When compared with warfarin, XOAC therapy was associated with a decrease in haemorrhagic stroke, with a similar pattern for all regimens and meta-analysis showing a risk ratio of 0.488 (95% CI 0.396 to 0.601). Regarding total mortality, a favourable pattern was seen for all four regimens and meta-analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.892 (95% CI 0.840 to 0.947). Major bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding provided two examples regarding which heterogeneity would seem to exist, when XOAC drugs are compared with warfarin. In what concerns the incidence of myocardial infarction, the primary end point (stroke plus systemic embolism) and ischaemic stroke, the situation is less clear. These results are inconsistent with a putative 'group effect' for all the seven parameters under study, and for some of them it would probably be best to look at each of the individual trial data rather than at the meta-analysis data (which seem to lack a clear biological meaning). CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban have shown interesting effects, when compared with warfarin in clinical trials, in patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly with regard to haemorrhagic stroke and to the mortality rate. No other consistent conclusions concerning a putative 'group effect' can be reached at the present stage. Concerns regarding adherence to therapy, possible drug interactions, cost and current absence of antidotes may be taken into consideration when choosing an anticoagulant drug."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents the most prevalent cause of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal infections in health care facilities in the developed world. Disease symptoms are caused by the two homologous exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Standard therapy for CDI involves administration of antibiotics that are associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment paradigms that target the toxins rather than the organism itself. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the antitoxin antibodies are protective in multiple murine models of CDI, including systemic and local (gut) toxin challenge models, as well as primary and recurrent models of infection in mice. Systemically administered actoxumab-bezlotoxumab prevents both the damage to the gut wall and the inflammatory response, which are associated with C. difficile in these models, including in mice challenged with a strain of the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Furthermore, mutant antibodies (N297Q) that do not bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors provide a level of protection similar to that of wild-type antibodies, demonstrating that the mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins and does not involve host effector functions. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the prevention of recurrent disease observed in CDI patients in clinical trials."

P., Parvatiyar, M. S., Pinto, J. R., Marquardt, M. L., Bos, J. M., Tester, D. J., Ommen, S. R., Potter, J. D., and Ackerman, M. J. (2008) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 45, 281-288). We performed actomyosin ATPase and spectroscopic solution studies to investigate the molecular properties of these mutations. Actomyosin ATPase activity was measured as a function of [Ca(2+)] utilizing reconstituted thin filaments (TFs) with 50% mutant and 50% wild type (WT) and 100% mutant cardiac troponin (cTn) complexes: A8V, C84Y, and D145E increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity with only A8V demonstrating lowered Ca(2+) sensitization at the 50% ratio when compared with 100%; E134D was the same as WT at both ratios. Of these four mutants, only D145E showed increased ATPase activation in the presence of Ca(2+). None of the mutants affected ATPase inhibition or the binding of cTn to the TF measured by co-sedimentation. Only D145E increased the Ca(2+) affinity of site II measured by 2-(4'-(2''-iodoacetamido)phenyl)aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid fluorescence in isolated cTnC or the cTn complex. In the presence of the TF, only A8V was further sensitized to Ca(2+). Circular dichroism measurements in different metal-bound states of the isolated cTnCs showed changes in the secondary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E, whereas E134D was the same as WT. PyMol modeling of each cTnC mutant within the cTn complex revealed potential for local changes in the tertiary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E. Our results indicate that 1) three of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cTnC mutants increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilament; 2) the effects of the mutations on the Ca(2+) affinity of isolated cTnC, cTn, and TF are not sufficient to explain the large Ca(2+) sensitivity changes seen in reconstituted and fiber assays; and 3) changes in the secondary structure of the cTnC mutants may contribute to modified protein-protein interactions along the sarcomere lattice disrupting the coupling between the cross-bridge and Ca(2+) binding to cTnC."

Ten clinically and polysomnographically proven IH patients were recruited from the department of sleep medicine of the University Hospital of Muenster. Clinical diagnosis was done by two consecutive polysomnographies (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Fourteen clinical healthy volunteers served as control group. Dermal fibroblasts were obtained via punch biopsy and grown in cell culture. The expression of circadian clock genes was investigated by semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR qRT-PCR analysis, confirming periodical oscillation of expression of the core circadian clock genes BMAL1, PER1/2 and CRY1/2. The amplitude of the rhythmically expressed BMAL1, PER1 and PER2 was significantly dampened in dermal fibroblasts of IH compared to HC over two circadian periods whereas the overall expression of only the key transcriptional factor BMAL1 was significantly reduced in IH. Our study suggests for the first time an aberrant dynamics in the circadian clock in IH. These findings may serve to better understand some clinical features of the pathophysiology in sleep - wake rhythms in IH."

Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus."

Here, we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans. We show by RNA interference (RNAi) and biochemical depletion that NDC1 plays an important role in NPC and NE assembly in vivo and in vitro. RNAi experiments suggest a functional link between NDC1 and the soluble nucleoporins Nup93, Nup53, and Nup205. Importantly, NDC1 interacts with Nup53 in vitro. This suggests that NDC1 function involves forming a link between the NE membrane and soluble nucleoporins, thereby anchoring the NPC in the membrane."

In bacteria, extensive studies have been conducted with the MutH-dependent MMR in Escherichia coli and its close relatives. The picture of MutH-independent MMR in other bacteria is less clear, as MMR components other than MutS and MutL have not been identified in the majority of bacteria. Bacillus anthracis is one of the MutH-less Gram(+) bacteria in the phylum of Firmicutes. We used papillation as a tool to search for B. anthracis new mutator strains and identified a spontaneous mutator that carries a minitransposon insertion in the BAS4289 locus. The mutational frequency and specificity exhibited in this mutant were comparable to that of MMR-deficient strains with knockouts of mutL or mutS. It retained a similar UV sensitivity profile as that of the wild type. BAS4289 encodes a putative DNA helicase RecD2 that shares 30% sequence identity with Deinococcus radiodurans RecD2, a well characterized superfamily 1B helicase whose homologs are widely present in Firmicutes complete genomes. We demonstrated that the N-terminal region of RecD2, a unique sequence extension used to distinguish RecD2 from RecD1, was important for B. anthracis RecD2, as mutations in the N-terminal conserved motifs affected its DNA repair function. This is the first report of a RecD2 helicase being associated with MMR. RecD2 and our recently described YycJ protein are likely to be two additional components in the B. anthracis MutH-independent MMR system."

DATA SOURCE: An English-language literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed (1966-June 2013), using the keywords GSK2118436, dabrafenib, vemurafenib, selective BRAF inhibitor, and advanced melanoma, was conducted. Data were also obtained from package inserts, meeting abstracts, and clinical registries. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All relevant published articles on dabrafenib and vemurafenib were reviewed. Clinical trial registries and meeting abstracts were used for information about ongoing studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib. Dabrafenib has been approved to treat patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma based on its clinical benefit demonstrated in a randomized phase III study. It has also been shown to be safe and effective in patients with BRAF mutant advanced melanoma involving the brain. Dabrafenib is well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, and arthralgia. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that one BRAF inhibitor is superior to the other. With similar efficacy, therapy selection will likely be influenced by differential tolerability and cost. CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib joins vemurafenib to confirm the superior clinical outcome of the BRAF inhibitors when compared with dacarbazine in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive advanced melanoma. Active research is ongoing to expand its utility into the adjuvant setting and to circumvent rapid emergence of drug resistance."

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-17-92 contributes to the activated phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). METHODS: RASFs were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and the expression and regulation of the miR-17-92 cluster were studied using real-time quantitative PCR (PCR) and promoter activity assays. RASFs were transfected with single precursor molecules of miRNAs from miR-17-92 and the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytokines was measured by quantitative PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Potential miRNA targets were identified by computational prediction and were validated using reporter gene assays and Western blotting. The activity of NF-\u03baB signaling was determined by reporter gene assays. RESULTS: We found that TNF\u03b1 induces the expression of miR-17-92 in RASFs in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Transfection of RASFs with precursor molecules of single members of miR-17-92 revealed significantly increased expression levels of matrix-degrading enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in precursor miR-18a (pre-miR-18a)-transfected RASFs. Using reporter gene assays, we identified the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor TNF\u03b1-induced protein 3 as a new target of miR-18a. In addition, pre-miR-18a-transfected RASFs showed stronger activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, both constitutively and in response to TNF\u03b1 stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the miR-17-92-derived miR-18a contributes to cartilage destruction and chronic inflammation in the joint through a positive feedback loop in NF-\u03baB signaling, with concomitant up-regulation of matrix-degrading enzymes and mediators of inflammation in RASFs."

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical cardiac manifestations and temporal evolution of Marfan syndrome in children; to estimate the incidence of annuloaortic ectasia and mitral valve prolapse; and to evaluate tolerability and efficacy of beta-blockers in these patients. METHODS: During one year, 21 children with Marfan syndrome underwent serial clinical and echocardiographic examinations. Echocardiograms assessed: the presence of mitral valve prolapse, aortic root diameter, mitral and aortic valves regurgitation, and aortic enlargement during beta-blocker therapy. Eleven patients had two measurements of the aortic root taken one year apart. RESULTS: The children were asymptomatic throughout the study. Mitral prolapse was found in 11 (52%) children. Annuloaortic ectasia occurred in 16 (76%) patients and found to be mild in 42.8%, moderate in 9.5%, and severe in 23.8%. One of these patients underwent aortic valve replacement and repair of the ascending aorta by the Bentall-De Bono technique, with good results. Heart rate decreased by 13.6% (from 85 to 73 bpm; p < 0.009) with the use of beta-blockers; however, aortic root diameter increased by 1.4 mm/year (p < 0.02). One child could not be given beta-blockers due to bronchial asthma, and no significant side effects were observed in the remaining children, including one who also had bronchial asthma. CONCLUSION: The children remained asymptomatic throughout the study, the use of beta-blockers led to a significant decrease in heart rate, and no significant adverse effects were observed. Contrary to the literature, incidence of annuloaortic ectasia was high among the study population, greater than that of mitral valve prolapse, even during beta-blocker therapy."

Loss of function of p15INK4b and p16INK4a (multiple tumor suppressor-I and CDK4 inhibitor) determines impairment in the control of the cell cycle and contributes to the transformation of several cell types. METHODS: The authors examined 20 thyroid neoplasms (12 papillary carcinomas and 8 follicular adenomas) and 4 human thyroid carcinoma cell lines for gene mutations and epigenetic modifications of the p15INK4b and p16INK4a genes by Southern blot analysis, single strand conformation polymorphism, and a polymerase chain reaction-based methylation assay. RESULTS: Abnormalities of p16 were found in the four cell lines studied. In follicular carcinoma (WRO) cells, both the p15 and p16 genes were homozygously deleted. Undifferentiated carcinoma (FRO) cells had a nonsense point mutation at codon 72 (CGA-TGA, Arg-Stop) of p16, whereas the poorly differentiated papillary carcinoma (NPA) line harbored a point mutation at the exon 1-intron 1 boundary that altered the donor splicing site and caused an aberrantly spliced form of p16INK4a. Furthermore, p16 allelic loss was evident in the DNA of both FRO and NPA cells. Finally, p16 expression was absent in the ARO cell line, likely due to a de novo methylation of exon 1 of p16INK4a. Regarding the primary thyroid tumors, a missense point mutation at codon 91 was found in 1 of 12 papillary thyroid carcinomas (GCC-GTC, Ala-Val). No mutations were found in follicular adenomas. However, in 6 of 20 primary tumors there was hypermethylation at exon 1 of p16. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of p15 and p16 mutations in the cell lines described suggests involvement of these genes in immortalization in vitro. The p16 defects may have preexisted in a small subclone of the primary tumor that were selected for in vitro. Alternatively, p16 mutations may have arisen de novo during cell culture. Mutations of p15INK4b and p16INK4a do not appear to be critical events in the development of follicular adenomas or papillary carcinomas. However, de novo methylation of the 5' CpG island of p16 is common in primary tumors, indicating that the function of this gene may be lost as an epigenetic event during disease progression."

Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins are transcriptional regulators that mediate many aspects of plant responses to auxin. While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family."

OBJECTIVE: Anesthetic preconditioning appears to be a viable strategy to treat ischemic cerebral injury. Here we investigated 1) whether the protection conferred by sevoflurane preconditioning sustains in time; 2) whether sevoflurane preconditioning diminishes mitochondrial dysfunction following cerebral ischemia; and 3) whether mitochondrial permeability transition pore plays a crucial role in the sevoflurane preconditioning. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: : Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Rats underwent 2 hrs of focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Preconditioning was elicited with sevoflurane (2.3%) for 60 mins at 24 hrs before ischemia. The involvement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore was determined with a mitochondrial permeability transition pore opener atractyloside and a specific mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin A. In vitro study was performed on acutely isolated mitochondria subjected to calcium overload. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sevoflurane preconditioning significantly decreased the infarct size by 35.9% (95% confidence interval 6.5-28.4, p < .001). This reduction of injury volume was associated with a long-term improvement of neurological function according to modified neurological severity score (F = 13.6, p = .001) and sticky-tape test (F = 29.1, p < .001) for 42 days after ischemia. Furthermore, sevoflurane preconditioning markedly protected mitochondria, as indicated by preserved respiratory chain complex activities and membrane potential, lowered mitochondrial hydrogen-peroxide production, and attenuated mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Isolated mitochondria also demonstrated a reduced sensitivity to Ca-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening after pre-exposure to sevoflurane in vitro (95% confidence interval 24.2-196.5,p = .006). Inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore using cyclosporin A resulted in protective effects similar to those seen with sevoflurane preconditioning, whereas pharmacologically opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with atractyloside abrogated all the positive effects of sevoflurane preconditioning and cyclosporin A, including suppression of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, counteraction of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, and subsequent histological and behavioral improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane preconditioning protects mitochondria from cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and ameliorates long-term neurological deficits. Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is a crucial step in mediating the neuroprotection of sevoflurane preconditioning."

The methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo, but one of the difficulties in determining the biological relationships between the MMR-related proteins is the tendency of MutL to self-aggregate. The properties of a stable MutL homologue were investigated using a thermostable MutL (TmL) from Thermotoga maritima MSB8 and whose size exclusion chromatographic and crosslinking analyses were compatible with a dimeric form of TmL. TmL underwent conformational changes in the presence of nucleotides and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with ATP binding not requiring ssDNA binding activity of TmL, while ADPnP-stimulated TmL showed a high ssDNA binding affinity. Finally, TmL interacted with the T. maritima MutS (TmS), increasing the affinity of TmS to mismatched DNA base pairs and suggesting that the role of TmL in the formation of a mismatched DNA-TmS complex may be a pivotal observation for the study of the initial MMR system.

Cellular senescence has been recently shown to have an important role in opposing tumour initiation and promotion. Senescence induced by oncogenes or by loss of tumour suppressor genes is thought to critically depend on induction of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3-ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor genes do trigger a potent, tumour-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2. Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic-stress-driven senescence neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Atf4, p27 and p21. We further demonstrate that genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten-deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical studies. Our findings therefore provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for cancer prevention and therapy."

The pharmacotherapy of obesity has historically recorded an overall poor safety and efficacy profile largely because of the complex mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of obesity. It is hoped that a better understanding of the regulation of body weight will lead us to the development of effective and safer drugs. Recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of energy homeostasis has allowed the design of novel anti-obesity drugs targeting specific molecules crucial for the modulation of energy balance, including drugs that induce satiety, modulate nutrient absorption or influence metabolism or lipogenesis. Almost a decade after the Food and Drug Administration approved the first weight loss medication, it recently approved two novel anti-obesity drugs Belviq (lorcaserin) and Qsymia (topiramate and phentermine), thus signalling the beginning of a new era in the pharmacotherapy of obesity. It is believed that the next generation of weight-loss drugs will be based on combination treatments with gut hormones in a manner that mimics the changes underlying surgically induced weight loss thus introducing the so called 'bariatric pharmacotherapy'. An in-depth understanding of the interrelated physiological and behavioural effects of these new molecules together with the development of new treatment paradigms is needed so that future disappointments in the field of obesity pharmacotherapy may be avoided."

Sixty-one patients were treated with either ofatumumab-ICE (35) or ofatumumab-DHAP (26). The overall response rate (ORR) was 61%, and the complete response (CR) rate was 37%.

Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. In this paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of CUTs. In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation. Dissection of a CUT terminator reveals a minimal element sufficient for Nrd1- and Nab3-directed termination. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome."

Despite distinct time-dependent autophosphorylation kinetics by monitoring the phosphorylation of amino acid residues T68, S19, S33/35, T432, in Chk2 wildtype and Chk2 mutants (T68A, T68D and Q69E) they gave identical specific activities.

Transfection of HEK293 cells with Chk2 wildtype and Chk2 mutants in the absence or presence of DNA damage showed significant T68 phosphorylation already in the absence of DNA damaging reagents. Upon DNA damage, phosphorylation of additional Chk2 sites was observed (S19, S33/35). A comparison of ATM+/+ and ATM-/- cells with respect to phosphorylation of residues T68, S19, S33/35 in the absence and presence of DNA damage showed in all cases phosphorylation of T68, although signal intensity was increased ca. three-fold after DNA damage.

Mutations in Ras isoforms such as K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras contribute to roughly 85, 15, and 1% of human cancers, respectively. Proper membrane targeting of these Ras isoforms, a prerequisite for Ras activity, requires farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at the C-terminal CAAX box. We devised an in vivo screening strategy based on monitoring Ras activation and phenotypic physiological outputs for assaying synthetic Ras function inhibitors (RFI). Ras activity was visualized by the translocation of RBD Raf1 -GFP to activated Ras at the plasma membrane. By using this strategy, we screened one synthetic farnesyl substrate analog (AGOH) along with nine putative inhibitors and found that only m-CN-AGOH inhibited Ras activation. Phenotypic analysis of starving cells could be used to monitor polarization, motility, and the inability of these treated cells to aggregate properly during fruiting body formation. Incorporation of AGOH and m-CN-AGOH to cellular proteins was detected by western blot. These screening assays can be incorporated into a high throughput screening format using Dictyostelium discoideum and automated microscopy to determine effective RFIs. These RFI candidates can then be further tested in mammalian systems."

This nucleoporin contains a large cisternal N-terminal domain, a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and a single transmembrane segment. We show here that dimers of native gp210 can be isolated from cell extracts by immunoprecipitation, and from purified rat liver nuclear envelopes by velocity sedimentation and gel filtration. Cross-linking of proteins in isolated membranes prior to solubilization dramatically increases the proportion of dimers. The dimers are SDS-resistant, as previously observed for some integral membrane proteins of cis-Golgi and plasma membrane proteins, including glycophorin A. Larger oligomers of gp210 can also be obtained by gel filtration and denaturing electrophoresis, but unlike the dimers are dissociated by reduction and heating in the presence of SDS. We propose that gp210 is organized into the pore membrane as a large array of gp210 dimers that may constitute a luminal submembranous protein skeleton."

O-linked glucosylation of thymine in DNA (base J) is an important regulatory epigenetic mark in trypanosomatids. \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU). hmU is then glucosylated by a previously unknown glucosyltransferase. A recent computational screen identified a possible candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes. We demonstrate that recombinant JGT utilizes uridine diphosphoglucose to transfer glucose to hmU in the context of dsDNA. Mutation of conserved residues typically involved in glucosyltransferase catalysis impairs DNA glucosylation in vitro. The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J. Reintroduction of JGT in the JGT KO restores J synthesis. Ablation of JGT mRNA levels by RNAi leads to the sequential reduction in base J and increased levels of hmU that dissipate rapidly. The analysis of JGT function confirms the two-step J synthesis model and demonstrates that JGT is the only glucosyltransferase enzyme required for the second step of the pathway. Similar to the activity of the related Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases on 5mC, our studies also suggest the ability of the base J-binding protein enzymes to catalyze iterative oxidation of thymine in trypanosome DNA. Here we discuss the regulation of hmU and base J formation in the trypanosome genome by JGT and base J-binding protein."

Epigenetic inactivation of the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene (TSG) at chromosome 3p21.3 was examined in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Seventy-nine % (27 of 34) of primary tumors and 100% (8 of 8) of medulloblastoma cell lines displayed extensive tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation across the RASSF1A promoter-associated CpG island. Hypermethylation was associated with epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A transcription in medulloblastoma cell lines, and RASSF1A expression in these lines was restored after treatment with the DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. No evidence was found of RASSF1A inactivation by genetic mechanisms (gene mutation or deletion) in either cases with no evidence of RASSF1A hypermethylation or paired normal/tumor cases and cell lines with evidence of total RASSF1A CpG island hypermethylation. Epigenetic inactivation by biallelic hypermethylation therefore represents the primary mechanism of RASSF1A gene inactivation in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, RASSF1A hypermethylation is a frequent event in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis detectable in adult (5 of 7) and pediatric patients (22 of 27) and in all histological variants and age and sex groupings. Importantly, these data demonstrate that comprehensive analysis of the genome and epigenome will be required for identification of the key tumor suppressor genes involved in medulloblastoma development."

To investigate mTORC1 and mTORC2 function in vivo, we generated mice deficient for raptor, rictor, or mLST8. Like mice null for mTOR, those lacking raptor die early in development. However, mLST8 null embryos survive until e10.5 and resemble embryos missing rictor. mLST8 is necessary to maintain the rictor-mTOR, but not the raptor-mTOR, interaction, and both mLST8 and rictor are required for the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and PKCalpha, but not S6K1. Furthermore, insulin signaling to FOXO3, but not to TSC2 or GSK3beta, requires mLST8 and rictor.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Recent studies showed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) and its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) are significantly upregulated in both the tumor and its microenvironment, and act as key regulators of proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Our previous study showed that IL-8 overexpression in colorectal cancer cells triggers the upregulation of the CXCR2-mediated proliferative pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the CXCR2 antagonist, SCH-527123, inhibits colorectal cancer proliferation and if it can sensitize colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin both in vitro and in vivo. SCH-527123 showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects in HCT116, Caco2, and their respective IL-8-overexpressing variants colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, SCH-527123 was able to suppress CXCR2-mediated signal transduction as shown through decreased phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/AKT pathway. These findings corresponded with decreased cell migration and invasion, while increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines. In vivo results verified that SCH-527123 treatment decreased tumor growth and microvessel density when compared with vehicle-treated tumors. Importantly, these preclinical studies showed that the combination of SCH-527123 and oxaliplatin resulted in a greater decrease in cell proliferation, tumor growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis that was superior to single-agent treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that targeting CXCR2 may block tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. In addition, CXCR2 blockade may further sensitize colorectal cancer to oxaliplatin treatment."

Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane. The physiological role for junctin in the luminal regulation of RyR Ca(2+) release remains unresolved, but it appears to be essential for proper cardiac function since ablation of junctin results in increased ventricular automaticity. Given that the junctin levels are severely reduced in human failing hearts, we performed an in-depth study of the mechanisms affecting intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in junctin-deficient cardiomyocytes. In concurrence with sparks, JCN-KO cardiomyocytes display increased Ca(2+) transient amplitude, resulting from increased SR [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](SR)). Junctin ablation appears to affect how RyRs 'sense' SR Ca(2+) load, resulting in decreased diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak despite an elevated [Ca(2+)](SR). Surprisingly, the \u03b2-adrenergic enhancement of [Ca(2+)](SR) reverses the decrease in RyR activity and leads to spontaneous Ca(2+) release, evidenced by the development of spontaneous aftercontractions. Single channel recordings of RyRs from WT and JCN-KO cardiac SR indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of RyRs to luminal [Ca(2+)]: at low luminal [Ca(2+)] (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid RyR channels are less responsive to luminal [Ca(2+)]; conversely, high luminal [Ca(2+)] turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation. Thus, junctin produces complex effects on Ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal [Ca(2+)]-dependent dual response of junctin-devoid RyRs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of RyR channels at low luminal [Ca(2+)], and as an inhibitor at high luminal [Ca(2+)]. Because the crossover occurs at a [Ca(2+)](SR) that is close to that present in resting cells, it is possible that the activator-inhibitor role of junctin may be exerted under periods of prevalent parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively."

Cellular senescence is generally defined as an irreversible state of G1 cell cycle arrest in which cells are refractory to growth factor stimulation. Cellular senescence can be induced through several different mechanisms. Primary mammalian cells display a finite life span, suggesting a mechanism that counts cell divisions. Those cells initially proliferate but eventually enter a state of permanent growth arrest, called replicative senescence. Erosion of telomeric DNA has emerged as a key factor in replicative senescence, which is antagonized during cell immortalization. Nevertheless, besides telomere shortening, there are other mechanisms inducing a growth arrest similar to the replicative senescencent phenotype. Oncogenic or mitogenic signals as well as DNA damage can induce such a phenotype of cellular senescence. All forms of cellular senescence share common signaling pathways and morphological features. Thereby, p53 seems to be essential for the senescence response. Many of these senescence inducing mechanisms can be experimentally recapitulated by the introduction of defined genetic elements. Replicative senescence due to telomere shortening can, for example, be induced by a dominant negative version of telomerase, premature senescence by the overexpression of oncogenic ras, or p16."

Progressive accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) in the brain is implicated as the central event in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is thought that extracellular A\u03b2 triggers toxic signals leading to neurodegeneration. The events downstream of A\u03b2 however are not entirely clear. Clusterin (Apo J) is one of the major risk factors for sporadic form of AD. Clusterin binds to A\u03b2 and prevents A\u03b2 aggregation. In addition, clusterin promotes A\u03b2 degradation and accelerates A\u03b2 clearance from the brain. Clusterin thus protects neurons from A\u03b2 and loss of clusterin level in the brain is implicated as promoting AD pathology. In this study, we found that the level of clusterin protein but not mRNA is reduced in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. When rat hippocampal primary neurons were treated with A\u03b21-42, level of clusterin protein but not mRNA was downregulated. A\u03b21-42-induced downregulation of clusterin was blocked by lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride. In neurons, A\u03b21-42 induced expression of sortilin, a lysosomal sorting protein that targets proteins to lysosome for degradation. In BE(2) M17 human neuroblastoma cells, clusterin bound to sortilin and when sortilin expression was silenced, A\u03b21-42-induced clusterin downregulation was almost completely blocked. Our data demonstrate that in neurons, A\u03b21-42 promotes lysosomal degradation of clusterin by inducing expression of sortilin and provide a novel mechanism by which A\u03b2 promotes AD pathogenesis."

However, Notch-3 expression appeared to be increased in diseased tissue.

Notch-2 expression was more widely distributed, and detectable in hepatocytes, medium-sized bile ducts, and the sinusoidal endothelium. Notch-3 expression was seen on hepatocytes, with weaker expression detectable in portal veins, hepatic arteries, and the sinusoids. In normal liver tissue Notch-1, -2, and -3 were found to be coexpressed on bile duct epithelium; however, with the exception of Notch-3 in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) livers, expression was absent on proliferating ductules in all disease states examined. Interestingly, the expression of Notch-2 and -3 was associated with numerous small vessels within the portal tract septa of diseased tissue.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate, in admitted patients with transient ischemic attack, the accuracy of the ABCD(2) (age [A], blood pressure [B], clinical features [weakness/speech disturbance] [C], transient ischemic attack duration [D], and diabetes history [D]) score in predicting ischemic stroke within 7 days. METHODS: At 16 North Carolina hospitals, we enrolled a prospective, nonconsecutive sample of admitted patients with transient ischemic attack and with no stroke history, presenting within 24 hours of transient ischemic attack symptom onset. We conducted a medical record review to determine ischemic stroke outcomes within 7 days. According to a modified Rankin Scale Score, strokes were classified as disabling (>2) or nondisabling (< or =2). RESULTS: During a 35-month period, we enrolled 1,667 patients, of whom 373 (23%) received a diagnosis of an ischemic stroke within 7 days. Eighteen percent (69/373) of all strokes were disabling. We were unable to calculate an ABCD(2) score in 613 patients (37%); however, our imputed analysis indicated this did not significantly alter results. The discriminatory power of the ABCD(2) score was modest for ischemic stroke in 7 days (c statistic 0.59), and fair for disabling ischemic stroke within 7 days (c statistic 0.71). Patients characterized as low risk according to ABCD(2) score (< or =3) were at low risk for experiencing a disabling stroke within 7 days, with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.64) with missing values excluded and 0.34 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.76) when missing values were imputed. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests the best application of the ABCD(2) score may be to identify patients at low risk for an early disabling ischemic stroke. Further study of the ability to determine an ABCD(2) score in all patients is needed, along with validation in a large, consecutive population of patients with transient ischemic attack."

After fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression."

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription and play pivotal roles in various biological processes such as development, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. Identifying cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes is a crucial step in understanding gene regulatory networks. To this end, we have used a comparative genomics approach to identify putative cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes in vertebrates. DESCRIPTION: We have created a database named TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes & Associated COnserved Noncoding ElementS) (http://tfcones.fugu-sg.org) which contains all human, mouse and fugu TF-encoding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) associated with them. The CNEs were identified by gene-by-gene alignments of orthologous TF-encoding gene loci using MLAGAN. We also predicted putative transcription factor binding sites within the CNEs. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs contain experimentally defined binding sites for transcriptional activators and repressors, indicating that a majority of the CNEs may function as transcriptional regulatory elements. The TF-encoding genes that are involved in nervous system development are generally enriched for human-fugu CNEs. Users can retrieve TF-encoding genes and their associated CNEs by conducting a keyword search or by selecting a family of DNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: The conserved noncoding elements identified in TFCONES represent a catalog of highly prioritized putative cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes and are candidates for functional assay."

BACKGROUND: The stiff-man syndrome is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature. Autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase are present in about 60 percent of patients with the syndrome. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, seeking autoantibodies directed against nervous system antigens in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by immunocytochemical techniques, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. Serum samples from all three patients were negative for autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen were not detected in control patients with the stiff-man syndrome without breast cancer or in patients with cancer who did not have the syndrome. Within the nervous system, the 128-kd autoantigen was localized in neurons and concentrated at synapses. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer."

OBJECTIVE: To report long-term efficacy and safety data for everolimus for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). METHODS: This was an open-label extension phase of a prospective, phase 1-2 trial (NCT00411619) in patients > 3 years of age with SEGA associated with TSC. Patients received oral everolimus starting at 3 mg/m2 per day and subsequently titrated, subject to tolerability, to attain whole blood trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. Change in SEGA volume, seizures, and safety assessments were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Of 28 patients enrolled, 25 were still under treatment at the time of analysis. Median dose was 5.3 mg/m2/day and median treatment duration was 34.2 months (range 4.7-47.1). At all time points (18, 24, 30, and 36 months), primary SEGA volume was reduced by > 30% from baseline (treatment response) in 65%-79% of patients. All patients reported > 1 adverse event (AE), mostly grade 1/2 in severity, consistent with that previously reported, and none led to everolimus discontinuation. The most commonly reported drug-related AEs were upper respiratory infections (85.7%), stomatitis (85.7%), sinusitis (46.4%), and otitis media (35.7%). No drug-related grade 4 or 5 events occurred. CONCLUSION: Everolimus therapy is safe and effective for longer term (median exposure 34.2 months) treatment of patients with TSC with SEGA. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that everolimus, titrated to trough serum levels of 5-15 ng/mL, was effective in reducing tumor size in patients with SEGA secondary to TSC for a median of 34 months."

In this study, we describe an additional cohort of patients with apparently isolated EL. All underwent a detailed clinical exam with cardiac evaluation combined with ADAMTSL4 mutation analysis. Mutations were identified in 12/15 patients with EL. Besides the European founder mutation p. (Gln256Profs*38) we identified five further mutations not yet described in the literature: p. (Leu249Tyrfs*21), p. (Ala388Glyfs*8), p. (Arg746His), p. (Gly592Ser), and p. (Arg865His). Clinical evaluation showed common additional ocular features such as high myopia, but no major systemic findings. In particular: no dilatation of the aortic root was reported on. This report increases the total number of patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations reported on today and reviews in detail the clinical findings in all patients reported on to date demonstrate, that these patients have a mainly ocular phenotype. There are no consistent systemic findings. The differentiation between syndromic and isolated EL is crucial for the further surveillance, treatment, and counseling of these patients, especially in young children."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the current revascularization strategies in patients presenting with unprotected left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). RECENT FINDINGS: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the current standard of treatment for patients with LMCAD. The development and refinement of techniques increased the number of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in LMCAD patients. SUMMARY: Although several observational studies show comparable results of CABG and/or PCI in patients with LMCAD, there is currently no convincing randomized evidence that either one of the two is associated with better long-term survival. Recent meta-analyses of four small randomized trials revealed a similar rate of 1-year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, higher rates of target vessel revascularization and lower stroke rates for PCI. Pooling randomized patients studies stratified by lesion complexity strengthened the hypothesis that CABG is better in more complex LMCAD patients. However, the randomized comparisons are affected by methodological limitations and lack power to be conclusive. The ongoing Evaluation of XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Stent System Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial is expected to provide a better answer on the optimal treatment strategy for LMCAD patients. In the meantime, risk models need to be improved and the most appropriate revascularization strategy for the individual LMCAD patient should be chosen using a multidisciplinary heart team that considers not only risk models but also other clinical and economic facets."

Chromosome walking toward the centromeres reveals a group of repetitive sequences that occur only in the centromere regions of chromosomes I and II and at one other specific location in the S. pombe genome, presumably the centromere of chromosome III. The major class of large repeated sequence elements is 6.4 kilobases (kb) long (repeat K), portions of which occur at least twice on chromosome II and in several tandemly arranged intact copies at another centromeric location. Repeat K in turn contains groups of smaller repeats. Genetic recombination is strongly suppressed in the centromere II region, which contains at least 30 kb of repeated sequences. Centromeric DNA organization is much more complex in fission yeast than has been described in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly because of the larger more condensed nature of the S. pombe chromosomes."

BACKGROUND: Interim analyses of the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study showed superior overall and progression-free survival of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. We present the final protocol-specified survival analysis. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319. FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22\u00b79 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16\u00b70 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b787 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70009 and 0\u00b768, 0\u00b753-0\u00b786 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group. INTERPRETATION: Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma. FUNDING: Merck & Co."

Male but not female mice carrying a single R403Q missense allele for cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain (M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+) and F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+), respectively) develop significant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) compared with male and female wild-type mice (M-alphaMHC(+/+) and F-alphaMHC(+/+), respectively) after approximately 30 wk of age. We tested the hypothesis that myofilament mechanical performance differs between M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+) and F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+) at younger ages (10-20 wk) and could account for sex differences in HCM development. The sensitivity of chemically skinned myocardial strips to Ca(2+) activation (pCa(50)) was significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced in male mice independent of genotype (M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+): 5.70 +/- 0.06, M-alphaMHC(+/+): 5.63 +/- 0.05, F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+): 5.57 +/- 0.03, F-alphaMHC(+/+): 5.54 +/- 0.04) by two-way ANOVA, whereas maximum developed tension was significantly enhanced in alpha-MHC(R403Q/+) independent of sex (M-alphaMHC(R403Q/+): 29.3 +/- 2.3, M-alphaMHC(+/+): 26.0 +/- 1.4, F-alphaMHC(R403Q/+): 30.2 +/- 2.1, F-alphaMHC(+/+): 26.2 +/- 1.2 mN/mm(2)).

We did not find a statistically significant sex x mutation interaction for any measure of myofilament performance. Therefore, sarcomeric incorporation of the R403Q myosin similarly enhanced left ventricular myofilament mechanical performance in both male and female mice. The sex-dependent development of HCM due to the R403Q myosin may then be inhibited by female sex hormones, which may additionally underlie the observed sex differences for pCa(50) and unloaded shortening velocity."

Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins are transcriptional regulators that mediate many aspects of plant responses to auxin. While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family."

Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin. We have investigated the possibility that calsequestrin is a luminal calcium concentration sensor for the ryanodine receptor. We measured the luminal calcium concentration at which calsequestrin dissociates from the ryanodine receptor and the effect of calsequestrin on the response of the ryanodine receptor to changes in luminal calcium. We provide electrophysiological and biochemical evidence that: 1), luminal calcium concentration of >/=4 mM dissociates calsequestrin from junctional face membrane, whereas in the range of 1-3 mM calsequestrin remains attached; 2), the association with calsequestrin inhibits ryanodine receptor activity, but amplifies its response to changes in luminal calcium concentration; and 3), under physiological calcium conditions (1 mM), phosphorylation of calsequestrin does not alter its ability to inhibit native ryanodine receptor activity when the anchoring proteins triadin and junctin are present. These data suggest that the quaternary complex is intact in vivo, and provides further evidence that calsequestrin is involved in the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling pathway and has a role as a luminal calcium sensor for the ryanodine receptor."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder consisting of progressive loss of motor neurons. TDP-43 has been identified as a component of ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions of motor neurons in ALS. We focused on the diffuse cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity in ALS neurons, and quantitatively assessed it in comparison with skein/round TDP-43 and ubiquitin immunostaining in motor neurons of 30 sporadic ALS cases. The percentage of spinal motor neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity was higher than that of ubiquitin-immunoreactive ones. The percentage of TDP-43-positive motor neurons was independent of neuron counts in anterior horns, while the percentage of ubiquitinated neurons was inversely correlated. Aiming to define the cytosolic localization of TDP-43, the immunoblot analysis of spinal cord and frontal cortex showed that full-length TDP-43, the 45 kDa form and ubiquitinated TDP-43 are found in the soluble inclusion-free fraction. The present data suggest that delocalization, accumulation and ubiquitination of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of motor neurons are early dysfunctions in the cascade of the events leading to motor neuron degeneration in ALS, preceding the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Being cytoplasmic accumulation an ongoing event during the course of the illness, a therapeutic approach to this incurable disease can be envisaged."

The cardiac transient outward current I(to) is regulated by thyroid hormone (T3). However, it remains unclear whether T3 directly modulates underlying gene transcription and which thyroid receptor (TR) isoform might be responsible for gene transactivation. To clarify this situation, we analysed the role of T3 and its receptors alpha1 (TRalpha1) and beta1 (TRbeta1) in regulation of KCNA4, KCND2, KCND3 and KCNIP2 transcription in rat cardiomyocytes. Initial results demonstrated a T3-mediated increase of I(to) current density. T3 stimulation enhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while KCNIP2 remained unaffected. To dissect the role of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 in T3-dependent I(to) modulation, TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 were overexpressed in cardiomyocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription. To further evaluate a possible direct interaction of TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 with the KCND3 promoter, TR expression vectors were cotransfected with a construct containing 2335 bp of the KCND3 5'-flanking sequence linked to a luciferase reporter into ventricular myocytes. While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor enhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 stimulation. Deletion of the KCND3 5'-flanking region localized the suppressible promoter sequence for TRbeta1 to within -293 bp and the activating promoter sequence for TRalpha1 to within -2335 to -1654 bp of the transcription start site. Disruption of putative TR binding sites by mutagenesis abolished the TRalpha1- (G-1651T) and TRbeta1- (G-73T) mediated effects, indicating that TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 response elements map to different regions of the KCND3 promoter. Thus, I(to) is modulated by diverse T3-dependent regulation of underlying gene transcription. TRalpha1 and TRbeta1 exhibit distinct effects on KCND3 transactivation with TRalpha1 enhancing and TRbeta1 suppressing KCND3 transcription."

Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is a rare form of diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life. Heterozygous activation mutations in KCNJ11, encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, which acts as a key role in insulin secretion regulation, account for about half of the cases of PNDM. The majority of the patients represent isolated cases resulting from de novo mutations. Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome. Individuals with KCNJ11 mutations have been successfully transitioned from insulin to sulfonylurea (SU) therapy. Furthermore, there have been cases reported with variable improvement in neurological function following a successful switching. We describe a 12-year-old Portuguese girl with PNDM due to the previously reported R201C mutation in the KCNJ11 gene. Her medical history includes prematurity and moderate developmental delay. The mutation was inherited from her mother who has isolated PNDM. The patient was successfully transferred from insulin to SU, whereas her mother showed SU resistance. Despite good glycemic control, no improvements in the cognitive performance were verified. We present our experience in switching treatment from insulin to oral SUs in this family, and also discuss whether or not the girl's developmental delay is related with the Kir6.2 mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first Portuguese patient reported with successful transition to SU treatment."

BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas. METHODS: The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation. RESULTS: Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSIONS: People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles. The limitations of the principles in predicting ethical decision making are discussed."

Ras/Raf-prototypic oncogenes induce cellular senescence, a terminal cell-cycle arrest, as a default cellular safeguard program, while oncogenic Myc is known to rather promote apoptosis as the prime failsafe mechanism. We review and discuss here evidence for Myc-induced senescence - which is detectable to a limited degree as a cell-autonomous, direct response to Myc action, but occurs predominantly in a non-cell-autonomous fashion via crosstalk of the oncogene-driven cell population with non-neoplastic bystanders, namely cells of the host immune system, prompting them to release pro-senescent cytokines that strike back onto adjacent proliferating tumor cells. In particular, we discuss how Myc-evoked apoptosis serves as a signal for macrophage attraction and activation, followed by the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 as a cytokine that is capable of terminally arresting Myc-driven lymphoma cells without causing further DNA damage and without launching a senescence-associated, pro-inflammatory, and, therefore, potentially detrimental cytokine response in the target population. In essence, non-cell-autonomous but still oncogene-orchestrated senescence is a functionally relevant, robustly tumor-suppressive principle with critical implications for conceptually novel anti-cancer therapies in the clinic."

We have mapped the locus for EDMD-AD to an 8-cM interval on chromosome 1q11-q23 in a large French pedigree, and found that the EMD phenotype in four other small families was potentially linked to this locus. This region contains the lamin A/C gene (LMNA), a candidate gene encoding two proteins of the nuclear lamina, lamins A and C, produced by alternative splicing. We identified four mutations in LMNA that co-segregate with the disease phenotype in the five families: one nonsense mutation and three missense mutations. These results are the first identification of mutations in a component of the nuclear lamina as a cause of inherited muscle disorder. Together with mutations in EMD (refs 5,6), they underscore the potential importance of the nuclear envelope components in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular disorders."

BACKGROUND: Although bacteremias caused by the 6 ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (SOT), more information is urgently needed. We sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in SOT and determine the risk factors for mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of bacteremia after SOT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE bacteremia were identified. RESULTS: Eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by ESKAPE strains. Of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms. The only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with ESKAPE was septic shock (odds ratio [OR] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.038-87.682, P < 0.001). The factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were septic shock (OR = 16.558, 95% CI = 6.620-104.668, P = 0.003) and age > 40 years (OR = 7.521, 95% CI = 1.196-47.292, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older SOT recipients with bacteremia due to ESKAPE/rESKAPE organisms present with septic shock."

Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and the results revealed that uvrA and uvrB mutants are sensitive to this agent, while uvrC and cho mutants remain as the wild type strain.

Besides, a heavily damaging action of cisplatin can be seen not only by persistent nicks on genomic DNA, but also by NER gene expression exceeding manifold that seen after equivalent lethal doses of UV. Moreover, cisplatin caused an increase in uvrB gene expression from its putative upstream promoter P3 in an SOS-independent manner."

We undertook a comparative analysis of these techniques. The methods are: To compare the limit of detection (LOD), mutations in KRAS (codon 12/13 hotspot) and BRAF (V600E hotspot) were tested. DNA mixtures containing mutant alleles at a frequency of around 25%/12.5%/6%/3%/ 1.5%/0.8% were analysed. To compare frequency of mutation detection, 22 DNA samples (nine high quality samples from cell lines, 13 low quality samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue) were tested for three hotspots in KRAS (codons 12/13, 61 and 146) and two hotspots in BRAF (V600E and exon 11). HRM analysis of KRAS (codon12/13) and BRAF (V600E) showed that 3% and 1.5% mutant alleles respectively could be reliably detected whilst pyrosequencing reliably detected 6% mutant alleles in each case. Of 110 tests performed on 22 DNA samples, in 109 cases HRM and pyrosequencing gave identical results. Two of the samples tested had previously been called as wild type for KRAS by direct Sanger sequencing but were found to be mutant by both HRM and pyrosequencing. Both HRM and pyrosequencing can detect small numbers of mutant alleles although HRM has a lower limit of detection. Both are suitable for use in mutation detection and are both more sensitive than Sanger sequencing."

PURPOSE: Dovitinib is an orally available multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3, and PDGFR. This study was performed to investigate the potential drug-drug interaction of dovitinib with the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Non-smoking patients of > 18\u00a0years with advanced solid tumors, excluding breast cancer, were included. Patients were treated with a dose of 300\u00a0mg in 5\u00a0days on/2\u00a0days off schedule. Steady-state pharmacokinetic assessments of dovitinib were performed with or without fluvoxamine. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled; 24 were evaluable for drug-drug interaction assessment. Median age was 60\u00a0years (range 30-85). At steady state the geometric mean for dovitinib (coefficient of variation%) of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C ) were 2880\u00a0ng/mL\u00a0h (47%) and 144\u00a0ng/mL (41%), respectively. Following administration of dovitinib in combination with fluvoxamine the geometric mean of dovitinib AUC and C  were 8290\u00a0ng/mL\u00a0h (60%) and 259\u00a0ng/mL (45%), respectively. The estimated geometric mean ratios for dovitinib AUC and C  (dovitinib + fluvoxamine vs. dovitinib alone) were 2.88 [90% confidence interval (CI) 2.58, 3.20] and 1.80 (90% CI 1.66, 1.95). This effect is considered a moderate drug-drug interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Fluvoxamine co-administration resulted in a 80% increase in C  and a 188% increase in AUC of dovitinib. Given the increase in exposure to dovitinib observed, patients are at risk of dovitinib related toxicity. Dovitinib should, therefore, not be co-administered with moderate and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, without dose reduction."

Actin-crosslinking proteins organize actin into highly dynamic and architecturally diverse subcellular scaffolds that orchestrate a variety of mechanical processes, including lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in motile cells. How signalling pathways control and coordinate the activity of these crosslinkers is poorly defined. IRSp53, a multi-domain protein that can associate with the Rho-GTPases Rac and Cdc42, participates in these processes mainly through its amino-terminal IMD (IRSp53 and MIM domain). The isolated IMD has actin-bundling activity in vitro and is sufficient to induce filopodia in vivo. However, the manner of regulation of this activity in the full-length protein remains largely unknown. Eps8 is involved in actin dynamics through its actin barbed-ends capping activity and its ability to modulate Rac activity. Moreover, Eps8 binds to IRSp53. Here, we describe a novel actin crosslinking activity of Eps8. Additionally, Eps8 activates and synergizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro, enhancing IRSp53-dependent membrane extensions in vivo. Cdc42 binds to and controls the cellular distribution of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, supporting the existence of a Cdc42-IRSp53-Eps8 signalling pathway. Consistently, Cdc42-induced filopodia are inhibited following individual removal of either IRSp53 or Eps8. Collectively, these results support a model whereby the synergic bundling activity of the IRSp53-Eps8 complex, regulated by Cdc42, contributes to the generation of actin bundles, thus promoting filopodial protrusions."

Heterozygous activating mutations in the gene encoding for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) have recently been shown to be a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. Kir6.2 is expressed in muscle, neuron and brain as well as the pancreatic beta-cell, so patients with KCNJ11 mutations could have a neurological phenotype in addition to their diabetes. It is proposed that some patients with KCNJ11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes (DEND), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes. We identified KCNJ11 mutations in four of 10 probands with permanent neonatal diabetes and one affected parent; this included the novel C166F mutation and the previously described V59M and R201H. Four of the five patients with mutations had neurological features: the patient with the C166F mutation had marked developmental delay, severe generalised epilepsy, hypotonia and muscle weakness; mild developmental delay was present in the patient with the V59M mutation; one patient with the R201H mutation had acute and chronic neurological consequences of cerebral oedema and another had diabetic neuropathy from chronic hyperglycaemia. In conclusion, the clinical features in these patients support the existence of a discrete neurological syndrome with KCNJ11 mutations. The severe DEND syndrome was seen with the novel C166F mutation and mild developmental delay with the V59M mutation. These features differ markedly from the neurological consequences of acute or chronic diabetes."

The monkey would be a relevant animal model in which to study the role of lacritin in ophthalmic physiology and pathology. However, to our knowledge, no cDNA cloning or functional analysis of monkey lacritin has been performed. Thus, the purposes of this study were: (1) to clone the monkey ortholog of lacritin; (2) to characterize lacritin in tears from several species; and (3) to determine the tissues where lacritin is produced and secreted. cDNA for lacritin from rhesus macaque contained 547 bp, with 411 bp in an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 137 amino acids. Monkey lacritin showed 89% amino acid homology with human lacritin; one amino acid was deleted in all three monkey strains. The predicted MW of mature lacritin was 12.2 kDa, and the isoelectric point was 4.99. Lacritin showed anomalous migration at approximately 21.0 kDa on SDS-PAGE, as confirmed by immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing. Similar to native lacritin in monkey tears, a 21 kDa band was also detected in human tears. In contrast, no lacritin was observed at a similar position on SDS-PAGE in rat, rabbit and dog tears. In the monkey, lacritin mRNA was expressed highly in the lacrimal gland, moderately in the conjunctiva and the meibomian gland, and weakly in corneal epithelium. In primates, lacritin was produced in the lacrimal gland and secreted into tear fluid. These results suggest that lacritin might be important for the maintenance of the ocular surface in higher animals, such as monkeys and humans."

A gene structure prediction system FGENE has been developed based on the exon recognition functions. We compute a graph of mutual compatibility of different exons and present a gene structure models as paths of this directed acyclic graph. For an optimal model selection we apply a variant of dynamic programming algorithm to search for the path in the graph with the maximal value of the corresponding discriminant functions.

DNA looping is often involved in positive and negative regulation of gene transcription in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The transcription of the gal operon of Escherichia coli from two overlapping promoters P1 and P2 is negatively regulated via Gal repressosome assembly. It involves binding of two dimeric Gal repressor proteins (GalR) to two operators, O(E) and O(I), flanking the two promoters, and formation of 113 bp DNA loop due to tetramerization of the two bound GalR dimers. The process requires negatively supercoiled DNA and the presence of the histone-like protein HU. Previous modeling of the repressosome based on evaluation of DNA elastic energy suggested a mutual antiparallel, rather than parallel, orientation of the two gal operators in an under-twisted DNA loop. To visualize the Gal loop by atomic force microscopy (AFM), plasmid DNA molecules were constructed with increased distance between the two operators. The AFM results demonstrated the formation of an antiparallel DNA loop in the Gal repressosome consistent with our earlier hypothesis. Importantly, the overall shape of the GalR mediated loop proved to be indistinguishable from that in the chimerical loop of the same size containing two lac operators (instead of two gal operators) and formed by LacI. In addition, a possibility of the gal operon repression mediated by GalR in the absence of HU was shown in the new DNA constructs. Implications of these findings for the DNA structural organization in bacterial nucleoid are discussed."

BACKGROUND: Aseptic meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is characterized by meningeal inflammation that is not linked to identifiable bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of aseptic meningitis caused by herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 196 CSF samples were collected from patients with suspected meningitis. All samples were smear- and culture-negative for bacterial pathogens. The biochemical and cytological findings of CSF samples were also recorded. DNA was extracted from samples and PCR with specific primers was carried out to detect viruses. RESULTS: The 196 samples derived from 100 (52%) men and 96 (48%) women ranging in age from one day to 86 years with an average age of 32.3 \u00b1 25.3 years. Of them, 8 (4.08%) samples yielded positive results, including 5 (2.55%) cases of VZV infection and 3 (1.53%) cases of HSV-1 infection. No cases of HSV-2, CMV or EBV infection were detected. CSF protein and glucose levels among positive cases were all in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a considerable rate of herpesvirus infection in patients with aseptic meningitis, and that VZV is the most common herpesvirus to cause infection followed by HSV-1. Our results also showed that a moderate increase in the WBC count and predominance of lymphocytes can be valuable clues in diagnosing viral meningitis. Given the different approaches of drug therapy in bacterial and viral meningitis, use of molecular methods is necessary in hospitals to rapidly discriminate between them."

We report a new subfamily of alpha satellite DNA (pTRA-2) which is found on all the human acrocentric chromosomes. The alphoid nature of the cloned DNA was established by partial sequencing. Southern analysis of restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments from mouse/human hybrid cells containing only human chromosome 21 showed that the predominant higher-order repeating unit for pTRA-2 is a 3.9 kb structure. Analysis of a \"consensus\" in situ hybridisation profile derived from 13 normal individuals revealed the localisation of 73% of all centromeric autoradiographic grains over the five acrocentric chromosomes, with the following distribution: 20.4%, 21.5%, 17.1%, 7.3% and 6.5% on chromosomes 13, 14, 21, 15 and 22 respectively. An average of 1.4% of grains was found on the centromere of each of the remaining 19 nonacrocentric chromosomes. These results indicate the presence of a common subfamily of alpha satellite DNA on the five acrocentric chromosomes and suggest an evolutionary process consistent with recombination exchange of sequences between the nonhomologues. The results further suggests that such exchanges are more selective for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 than for chromosomes 15 and 22. The possible role of centromeric alpha satellite DNA in the aetiology of 13q14q and 14q21q Robertsonian translocations involving the common and nonrandom association of chromosomes 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 is discussed."

The CatalystHipHop approach was used to generate a pharmacophore model for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors based on a training set of 15 active inhibitors (1\u00e215). The degree of fitting of the test set compounds (16\u00e232) to the generated hypothetical model revealed a qualitative measure of the more or less selective COX-2 inhibition of these compounds. The results indicate that most derivatives (16, 18, 20\u00e225, and 30\u00e232) are able to effectively satisfy the proposed pharmacophore geometry using energy accessible conformers (E(conf) < 20 kcal/mol). In addition, the triazole derivatives (16\u00e232) were docked into COX-1 and COX-2 X-ray structures, using the program GOLD. Based on the docking results it is suggested that several of these novel triazole derivatives are active COX inhibitors with a significant preference for COX-2. In principle, this work presents an interesting, comprehensive approach to theoretically predict the mode of action of compounds that showed anti-inflammatory activity in an in vivo model."

The etiology of the Carney's triad (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pulmonary chondromas, and paragangliomas) is unknown, and only 57 cases have been reported since its identification in 1977. We report the clinical course of a female with the complete triad and some additional tumors. Bilateral vagal paragangliomas were treated surgically and with radiotherapy between the ages of 24 and 26 years. Subsequently she underwent surgery for a gastric leiomyosarcoma (27 years), a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland (49 years) and a multifocal breast cancer with axillary spread (50 years). A calcified lesion was also noticed in the left lung, the radiologic diagnosis of which was consistent with chondroma. A mediastinal paraganglioma, detected at 56 years on a control X-ray of the chest, was partially excised at 63 years. At the last control, performed at 66 years, the patient was alive with residual cervical and mediastinal paraganglioma. Her younger brother was affected by Hirschsprung's disease and died at 54 years of rectal cancer. Her daughter is 33 and has been suffering since birth with severe constipation. In conclusion, this is one of the longest followed-up patients with Carney's triad. Her case illustrates the need for early recognition of the setting in order to detect the component tumors at a stage when surgery may be curative, and careful and life-long follow-up, both because the multicentricity of the classic components tends to manifest metachronously and because of the tendency to develop other tumors, some of which may be malignant. Furthermore, the presence of Hirschsprung's disease in the patient's family, coupled with the alleged common origin of two component lesions from derivatives of the neural crest, open new avenues for the understanding of this disorder."

Obesity is a world-wide epidemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality which costs billions of dollars per year. The associated related conditions are many and include heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea and certain types of cancer. Given that it is a multifactorial problem, the treatments must also address the numerous causes associated with the development of obesity. The neurohormonal regulation of feeding and energy is a complex system often necessitating modification through more than 1 pathway to achieve weight loss. Therefore, in addition to lifestyle changes, attenuation of caloric intake and increase in caloric expenditure, pharmacotherapies, including combination medications, may prove beneficial in its treatment. Adding to the current available pharmacotherapies for obesity, the Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 2 new combination medications known as lorcaserin (Belviq) and phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia). As with these and other medications used for weight loss, clinical cautions, side effects, precise review of patients' medical history and selecting the appropriate medication are imperative. Additionally, close follow-up is necessary in patients undergoing treatment for weight loss. As weight loss progresses, patients who are currently undergoing concomitant treatment for comorbid diabetes and hypertension need to be monitored for appropriate changes in medications used to treat those conditions. Weight loss is often accompanied by improvement in blood pressure and glucose levels and therefore resting blood pressure and fasting and/or postprandial plasma glucose levels should be monitored at follow-up. Although unique to each individual, the benefits of weight loss are substantial and can improve well-being and physical health."

The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important regulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1), consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2. Both complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members: mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKC\u03b1 (protein kinase C\u03b1) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2 components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover, Protor knockout mice display no defects in the phosphorylation of Akt and PKC\u03b1 at their hydrophobic or turn motifs. Strikingly, we observed that Protor-1 knockout mice displayed markedly reduced hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of SGK1 and its physiological substrate NDRG1 (N-Myc downregulated gene 1) in the kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that Protor-1 may play a role in enabling mTORC2 to efficiently activate SGK1, at least in the kidney."

The phenomenon of parental imprinting has become increasingly important in disciplines such as evolution, genetics, molecular biology, embryology and pathology. Principally, parental imprinting refers to a parent-of-origin dependent expression of a subset of autosomal loci, independent of the sex of the offspring. Today, at least seven such loci have been identified, including the human IGF2 gene. It appears that the set of imprinted genes is not always identical between the species, although the importance of maintaining this kind of gene regulation is evolutionarily conserved. It is particularly interesting from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, appear to involve unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci. We show here that the four different human IGF2 promoters are expressed mono- and/or biallelically in complex patterns in postnatal liver specimens."

BACKGROUND: Interim analyses of the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study showed superior overall and progression-free survival of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. We present the final protocol-specified survival analysis. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319. FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22\u00b79 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16\u00b70 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b787 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70009 and 0\u00b768, 0\u00b753-0\u00b786 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks vs ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group. INTERPRETATION: Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma. FUNDING: Merck & Co."

BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients, who face an elevated risk of stroke but difficulty sustaining warfarin treatment. The oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). This prespecified secondary analysis compares outcomes in older and younger patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: There were 6229 patients (44%) aged > 75 years with atrial fibrillation and > 2 stroke risk factors randomized to warfarin (target international normalized ratio=2.0-3.0) or rivaroxaban (20 mg daily; 15 mg if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), double blind. The primary end point was stroke and systemic embolism by intention to treat. Over 10 866 patient-years, older participants had more primary events (2.57% versus 2.05%/100 patient-years; P=0.0068) and major bleeding (4.63% versus 2.74%/100 patient-years; P<0.0001). Stroke/systemic embolism rates were consistent among older (2.29% rivaroxaban versus 2.85% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.02) and younger patients (2.00% versus 2.10%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.19; interaction P=0.313), as were major bleeding rates ( > 75 years: 4.86% rivaroxaban versus 4.40% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.34; <75 years: 2.69% versus 2.79%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.19; interaction P=0.336). Hemorrhagic stroke rates were similar in both age groups; there was no interaction between age and rivaroxaban response. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had higher stroke and major bleeding rates than younger patients, but the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban relative to warfarin did not differ with age, supporting rivaroxaban as an alternative for the elderly."

GABARAPL1 is involved in the intracellular transport of receptors, via an interaction with tubulin and GABA(A) or kappa opioid receptors, and also participates in autophagy and cell proliferation. In the present study, we identify the HSP90 protein as a novel interaction partner for GABARAPL1 using GST pull-down, mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. GABARAPL1 and HSP90 partially colocalize in MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressed Dsred-GABARAPL1 and in rat brain. Moreover, treatment of MCF-7 cells overexpressed FLAG-GABARAPL1-6HIS with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG promotes the GABARAPL1 degradation, a process that is blocked by proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, bortezomib and lactacystin.

BACKGROUND: During long-term anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation, temporary interruptions (TIs) of therapy are common, but the relationship between patient outcomes and TIs has not been well studied. We sought to determine reasons for TI, the characteristics of patients undergoing TI, and the relationship between anticoagulant and outcomes among patients with TI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF), a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study of rivaroxaban and warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes, including stroke, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, death, myocardial infarction, and bleeding, were reported in participants who experienced TI (3-30 days) for any reason. The at-risk period for outcomes associated with TI was from TI start to 30 days after resumption of study drug. In 14 236 participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 4692 (33%) experienced TI. Participants with TI were similar to the overall ROCKET AF population in regard to baseline clinical characteristics. Only 6% (n=483) of TI incidences involved bridging therapy. Stroke/systemic embolism rates during the at-risk period were similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.30% versus 0.41% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=0.74 [0.36-1.50]; P=0.40). Risk of major bleeding during the at-risk period was also similar in rivaroxaban-treated and warfarin-treated participants (0.99% versus 0.79% per 30 days; hazard ratio [confidence interval]=1.26 [0.80-2.00]; P=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: TI of oral anticoagulation is common and is associated with substantial stroke risks and bleeding risks that were similar among patients treated with rivaroxaban or warfarin. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal management strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation requiring TI of anticoagulation.

          "context": "[Novel SCN5A gene mutations associated with Brugada syndrome: V95I, A1649V and delF1617]. OBJECTIVE: Brugada syndrome is an inherited channelopathy that characterized by ST-segment elevation in the right precordial lead (V(1)-V(3)) on the electrocardiogram with or without right bundle branch block and related with high risk of sudden cardiac death and structurally normal hearts. The first and only gene linked to this disease is SCN5A, a gene encodes for alpha subunit of the cardiac sodium channel. The objective of this study is to explore SCN5A gene mutations in Chinese patients with Brugada syndrome. METHODS: Four patients diagnosed as Brugada syndrome and nine patients with suspected Brugada syndrome were chosen for the study. The exons in the functional regions of SCN5A gene were amplified with polymerase chain reaction and the amplified products were sequenced with Sanger method. If a mutation was identified, patient's family members were also screened. RESULTS: Two heterozygous mutations were found in one family diagnosed as Brugada syndrome. One missense mutation was a G-->A transition in the first nucleotide of codon 95 in SCN5A gene exon 3, which was predicted to result in substitution of Valine with Isoleucine (V95I). The other missense mutation was a C-->T transition in the second nucleotide of codon 1649 in SCN5A gene exon 28, which was predicted to result in substitution of Alanine with Valine (A1649V). A heterozygous mutation was identified in one family suspected to have the disease. The mutation was a three nucleotides (TCT) deletion that caused Phenylalanine deletion in codon 1617 in SCN5A gene exon 28. The three mutations were not detected in 100 control chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation in SCN5A gene is one of the causes of Brugada syndrome in Chinese. Three novel SCN5A gene mutations were identified in Chinese with Brugada syndrome, which expands the spectrum of SCN5A mutations associated with the disease."

The pedigree contains 19 family members spanning three generations, with four affected individuals. Affected members with early stage disease in this family presented with marked autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension and decreased cardiac uptake with [123]I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigram features that have not been described in previous cases.

KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab. KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies. Because of the major clinical impact of KRAS status, an observational study has been designed in France, focusing on the ability to perform KRAS testing between october 2008 and october 2009. The study was retro-prospective, national, multicentric, descriptive and non interventional, concerning public and private institutions and KRAS non mutated patients treated with panitumumab. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate delays between the genotyping KRAS request and the result. Secondary objectives were: type of genotyping requests (systematic/prospective or specific/retrospective), prevalence of the different genotyping techniques, delays between the genotyping KRAS request and therapy with panitumumab. Overall, 329 patients from 66 centres have been included. About half of them belonged to private institutions. The results were obtained with a mean delay of 33.4 \u00b1 39.8 days (CI 95%: [28.8; 37.9] days; median: 24 days). Most of KRAS genotyping tests were performed on specific requests (65.3%), from a primary tumor (80.4%) and from a surgical specimen (73.9%). The more frequently used techniques for KRAS genotyping were: real time PCR (36.2%), sequencing (24.8%) and pyrosequencing (13.2%). This study emphasizes the functionality of cancer molecular genetic platforms dedicated to KRAS genotyping, which allow the use of molecular predictive biomarkers by different medical institutions. This study also underlines the broad spectrum of genotyping techniques (no consensus). The delays of response are still longer than expected but might be improved by optimizing the procedures."

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have found that p53 and its' associated cell cycle pathways are major inhibitors of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation. In the same family as p53 is p73, which shares sequence similarities with p53. However, p73 also has distinct properties of its own, such as two alternative promoters to express transactivation of p73 (TAp73) and N terminal deleted p73 (DNp73). Functionally, TAp73 acts similarly to p53 in tumor suppression. However, DNp73, on the other hand acts as an oncogene to suppress p53 and p73 induced apoptosis. Therefore, how can p73 have opposing roles in human iPS cell generation? RESULTS: Transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc (4TF, Yamanaka factors) are used as basal conditions to generate iPS cells. In addition, the factor of DNp73(actually alpha splicing DNp73, DNp73\u03b1) is used to generate iPS cells. The experiment found that the addition of DNp73 gene increases human iPS cell generation efficiency by 12.6 folds in comparison to human fibroblast cells transduced with only the basal conditions. Also, iPS cells generated with DNp73 expression are more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: This study found DNp73, a family member of p53, is also involved in the human iPS cell generation. Specifically, that the involvement of DNp73 generates iPS cells that are more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation. Therefore, this data may prove to be useful in future developmental studies and cancer researches."

DNA replication initiates by formation of a pre-replication complex on sequences termed origins. In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1. Eukaryotic ORC is considered to be composed of six subunits, named Orc1-6, and monomeric Cdc6 is closely related in sequence to Orc1. However, ORC has been little explored in protists, and only a single ORC protein, related to both Orc1 and Cdc6, has been shown to act in DNA replication in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we identify three highly diverged putative T. brucei ORC components that interact with ORC1/CDC6 and contribute to cell division. Two of these factors are so diverged that we cannot determine if they are eukaryotic ORC subunit orthologues, or are parasite-specific replication factors. The other we show to be a highly diverged Orc4 orthologue, demonstrating that this is one of the most widely conserved ORC subunits in protists and revealing it to be a key element of eukaryotic ORC architecture. Additionally, we have examined interactions amongst the T. brucei MCM subunits and show that this has the conventional eukaryotic heterohexameric structure, suggesting that divergence in the T. brucei replication machinery is limited to the earliest steps in origin licensing."

Recent studies have highlighted several genes subject to natural selection in native high-altitude Tibetans. Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions. Uncovering the molecular basis of hypoxic adaptation should have implications for understanding hematological and other adaptations involved in hypoxia tolerance. Because the hypoxia response involves a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic functions, this knowledge would improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and could ultimately be translated into targeted therapies for oxygen deprivation, cardiopulmonary and cerebral pathologies, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity."

Direct conversion of fibroblasts to induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) has great potential for regenerative medicine. Recent publications have reported significant progress, but the evaluation of reprogramming has relied upon non-functional measures such as flow cytometry for cardiomyocyte markers or GFP expression driven by a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter. The issue is one of practicality: the most stringent measures - electrophysiology to detect cell excitation and the presence of spontaneously contracting myocytes - are not readily quantifiable in the large numbers of cells screened in reprogramming experiments. However, excitation and contraction are linked by a third functional characteristic of cardiomyocytes: the rhythmic oscillation of intracellular calcium levels. We set out to optimize direct conversion of fibroblasts to iCMs with a quantifiable calcium reporter to rapidly assess functional transdifferentiation. We constructed a reporter system in which the calcium indicator GCaMP is driven by the cardiomyocyte-specific Troponin T promoter. Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors. HNGMT is also significantly more effective than previously published factor combinations for the transdifferentiation of adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts to iCMs. Quantification of calcium function is a convenient and effective means for the identification and evaluation of cardiomyocytes generated by direct reprogramming. Using this stringent outcome measure, we conclude that HNGMT produces iCMs more efficiently than previously published methods."

Because of the uncertainty of survival and the high incidence of fatal complications, however, chemotherapy and radiotherapy generally have been considered preferable and surgery a treatment of last resort for these patients. Further, the selection criteria indicating surgery and reliable prognostic factors for survival remain controversial. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore assessed surgical complications, postoperative function, and risk factors affecting their overall survival. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients 60\u00a0years or older (range, 60-81\u00a0years) who had surgery for spinal metastases. The surgical complications were recorded and a VAS pain score, Frankel grade, and Karnofsky score were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed to identify factors associated with survival. The minimum followup was 6\u00a0months (mean, 22\u00a0months; range, 6-78\u00a0months). RESULTS: Surgical complications occurred in 21 patients. Pain levels decreased postoperatively in 90% of patients and neurologic function improved in 78%. The Karnofsky status improved in 58 patients giving an improvement rate of 63%. The overall survival rates at 1\u00a0year and 3\u00a0years were 61% and 35% with a median of 15\u00a0months. Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi score independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest surgery for spinal metastasis can achieve pain relief, neurologic improvement, and restoration of general condition but with a high risk of complications. Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi scoring independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases after surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

Fermentation products of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 (a parent strain for lovastatin production) were collected, and the coexistence of itaconic acid (IA) with lovastatin was confirmed in this study. Using a lactose-based medium (LBM), lovastatin production was 873 mg/l on day 10, but IA production was only 22-28 mg/l during the cultures. When lactose in LBM was simply replaced with glucose, IA production was markedly enhanced by 20-fold (491 mg/l on day 5), which showed a growth-associated pattern. The findings indicated that the carbon source used (glucose or lactose) controlled the biosynthetic pathway. The net yield of lovastatin production when using lactose was calculated to be 25.1 mg/g (5.1-fold) in comparison with when using glucose in the cultures. Furthermore, lovastatin production was further increased by 9.2% when IA (0.5 g/l) was added to LBM. When IA was added at 5 g/l, the fermentation broth turned dark-brown, and lovastatin production was reduced by 18.0%.

However, the host factors that regulate LINE-1 retrotransposition are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome gene product SAMHD1, recently revealed to be an inhibitor of HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infectivity and neutralized by the viral Vpx protein, is also a potent regulator of LINE-1 and LINE-1-mediated Alu/SVA retrotransposition. We also found that mutant SAMHD1s of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome patients are defective in LINE-1 inhibition. Several domains of SAMHD1 are critical for LINE-1 regulation. SAMHD1 inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition in dividing cells. An enzymatic active site mutant SAMHD1 maintained substantial anti-LINE-1 activity. SAMHD1 inhibits ORF2p-mediated LINE-1 reverse transcription in isolated LINE-1 ribonucleoproteins by reducing ORF2p level. Thus, SAMHD1 may be a cellular regulator of LINE-1 activity that is conserved in mammals."

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis, and included among the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. The presence of cutaneous psoriasis is very important for correct and early diagnosis of PsA, because the cutaneous lesions precede the appearance of joint manifestations. Thus, dermatologists are in a position to detect the condition at its inception. PsA is clinically subdivided into asymmetric oligoarticular arthritis, symmetric polyarthritis, distal interphalanges predominant, arthritis mutilans, and spondylitis types. PsA has several unique characteristics, such as enthesopathy, dactylitis and abnormal bone remodeling. Genetic, environmental, and immunological factors are important in its development. The triggering role of physical stress is seen in the \"deep Koebner\" phenomenon, which causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and in enthesis, resulting in peripheral arthritis. Cellular infiltrates such as activated T-cells and macrophages are thought to play important roles in the induction of inflammatory and destructive processes in joint tissues, as well as psoriatic skin. New ideas regarding the involvement of the IL-23/Th17 axis have emerged, and the dramatic effects of targeting therapies have highlighted the physiological role of key cytokines in psoriasis. Current views on the pathogenesis of PsA are reviewed from a dermatological perspective."

BACKGROUND: In LBP patients, the relationship between pain and physical activity remains unclear. Whereas a negative relationship between pain and self-reported physical activity was found, this relation disappeared in the case of overt behavioral data (e.g., accelerometer). Cognitive-behavioral models of the development of chronic pain suggest subgroups with signs of physical underuse and overuse. AIMS: To examine if patients with pain-related adaptive, endurance and fear-avoidance coping differ in pain, self-reported physical function and overt physical activity 6 months after disc surgery. METHODS: 24 patients completed questionnaires (Von Korff chronic pain grade (CPG), Kiel pain inventory (KPI), Funktionsfragebogen Hannover-R\u00fccken FFbH-R) and underwent an 8-h accelerometer assessment in their daily life (physical activity level (PAL), number of constant postures (CP)). The KPI differed between adaptive coping (AC) (N=9), fear avoidance coping (FAC) (N=1) and endurance coping (EC) (N=14). RESULTS: In the whole group, pain intensity was negative related to self-reported physical activity whereas PAL and CP displayed no correlation with pain. EC patients showed significantly higher pain scores and lower self-reported physical functioning compared to AC but the same level of PAL and furthermore, a significantly higher number of CPs in daily life. The visual inspection of the FAC patient revealed also high pain, low physical functioning and low overt physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of pain-related coping modes yielded an important differentiation between subgroups of LBP patients 6 months after surgery. Endurance copers displayed signs of overuse in their daily behavior in spite of pain than adaptive copers. The one fear avoidance coper tends to do less physical activity in the sense of underuse."

Helmann, Antibiotic-inducible promoter regulated by the cell envelope stress-sensing two-component system LiaRS of Bacillus subtilis; Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., Vol 48 (2004) pp. 2888-2896) was analyzed in the presence of different lantibiotics. We could show dose-dependent cell wall biosynthesis stress of reporter cells in response to the action of the lantibiotics subtilin produced by B. subtilis, epidermin and gallidermin of Staphylococcus epidermidis or S. gallinarum, respectively, in both, agar-plate and liquid culture-based assays. Surprisingly, also cinnamycin of Streptomyces cinnamoneus cinnamoneus), previously known to bind specifically to phosphatidylethanolamin of biological membranes, provoked strong cell wall biosynthetic stress. Our results show that our system can be used for screening purposes, for example to discover novel inhibitors of cell wall biosynthesis."

Approximately 80% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1) positive, and although women typically initially respond well to antihormonal therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, resistance often emerges. Although a variety of resistance mechanism may be at play in this state, there is evidence that in many cases the ER still plays a central role, including mutations in the ER leading to constitutively active receptor. Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-\u03b1 and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents. However, fulvestrant suffers from poor pharmaceutical properties and must be administered by intramuscular injections that limit the total amount of drug that can be administered and hence lead to the potential for incomplete receptor blockade. We describe the identification and characterization of a series of small-molecule, orally bioavailable SERDs which are potent antagonists and degraders of ER-\u03b1 and in which the ER-\u03b1 degrading properties were prospectively optimized. The lead compound 11l (GDC-0810 or ARN-810) demonstrates robust activity in models of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, and is currently in clinical trials in women with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer."

The relationship of Kartagener's syndrome to immobile cilia syndrome is a fascinating merging of clinical observations and basic science in Zurich, Stockholm, and Toronto. In 1933, Manes Kartagener, a Zurich pulmonary physician, reported four patients with the triad of sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. In the following decades, he reviewed reports of hundreds of cases, but the fact that the male patients with the condition never had offspring eluded his notice. In the 1970s, Bjorn Afzelius, a Ph.D. ultrastructuralist from Stockholm, reported cilia immotility in infertile males, some of the cases occurring in families. Half of the cases had Kartagener's triad. The observation of Afzelius was soon applied to children by Jennifer Sturgess, a Ph.D. ultrastructuralist, and her medical colleagues in Toronto. With over 500 MEDLINE references since 1966 on Kartagener's and over 1,000 references on immotile cilia, the causes of the pulmonary infections have become clearer as the patients demonstrate impaired clearance of mucus with resultant sinus and bronchial disease. The cause of the situs inversus remains elusive to this day. It is appropriate to call the condition Kartagener-Afzelius syndrome."

MOTIVATION: Many important biological processes such as cell signaling, transport of membrane-impermeable molecules, cell-cell communication, cell recognition and cell adhesion are mediated by membrane proteins. Unfortunately, as these proteins are not water soluble, it is extremely hard to experimentally determine their structure. Therefore, improved methods for predicting the structure of these proteins are vital in biological research. In order to improve transmembrane topology prediction, we evaluate the combined use of both integrated signal peptide prediction and evolutionary information in a single algorithm. RESULTS: A new method (MEMSAT3) for predicting transmembrane protein topology from sequence profiles is described and benchmarked with full cross-validation on a standard data set of 184 transmembrane proteins. The method is found to predict both the correct topology and the locations of transmembrane segments for 80% of the test set. This compares with accuracies of 62-72% for other popular methods on the same benchmark. By using a second neural network specifically to discriminate transmembrane from globular proteins, a very low overall false positive rate (0.5%) can also be achieved in detecting transmembrane proteins. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the described method is available both as a web server (http://www.psipred.net) and as downloadable source code from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/memsat. Both the server and source code files are free to non-commercial users. Benchmark and training data are also available from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/memsat."

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have found that p53 and its' associated cell cycle pathways are major inhibitors of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation. In the same family as p53 is p73, which shares sequence similarities with p53. However, p73 also has distinct properties of its own, such as two alternative promoters to express transactivation of p73 (TAp73) and N terminal deleted p73 (DNp73). Functionally, TAp73 acts similarly to p53 in tumor suppression. However, DNp73, on the other hand acts as an oncogene to suppress p53 and p73 induced apoptosis. Therefore, how can p73 have opposing roles in human iPS cell generation? RESULTS: Transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and cMyc (4TF, Yamanaka factors) are used as basal conditions to generate iPS cells. In addition, the factor of DNp73(actually alpha splicing DNp73, DNp73\u03b1) is used to generate iPS cells. The experiment found that the addition of DNp73 gene increases human iPS cell generation efficiency by 12.6 folds in comparison to human fibroblast cells transduced with only the basal conditions. Also, iPS cells generated with DNp73 expression are more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: This study found DNp73, a family member of p53, is also involved in the human iPS cell generation. Specifically, that the involvement of DNp73 generates iPS cells that are more resistant to in vitro and in vivo differentiation. Therefore, this data may prove to be useful in future developmental studies and cancer researches."

BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients, who face an elevated risk of stroke but difficulty sustaining warfarin treatment. The oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). This prespecified secondary analysis compares outcomes in older and younger patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: There were 6229 patients (44%) aged > 75 years with atrial fibrillation and > 2 stroke risk factors randomized to warfarin (target international normalized ratio=2.0-3.0) or rivaroxaban (20 mg daily; 15 mg if creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), double blind. The primary end point was stroke and systemic embolism by intention to treat. Over 10 866 patient-years, older participants had more primary events (2.57% versus 2.05%/100 patient-years; P=0.0068) and major bleeding (4.63% versus 2.74%/100 patient-years; P<0.0001). Stroke/systemic embolism rates were consistent among older (2.29% rivaroxaban versus 2.85% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.02) and younger patients (2.00% versus 2.10%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.19; interaction P=0.313), as were major bleeding rates ( > 75 years: 4.86% rivaroxaban versus 4.40% warfarin per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio=1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.34; <75 years: 2.69% versus 2.79%/100 patient-years; hazard ratio=0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.19; interaction P=0.336). Hemorrhagic stroke rates were similar in both age groups; there was no interaction between age and rivaroxaban response. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had higher stroke and major bleeding rates than younger patients, but the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban relative to warfarin did not differ with age, supporting rivaroxaban as an alternative for the elderly."

Transient overexpression of defined combinations of master regulator genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming: the acquisition of an alternative predicted phenotype from a differentiated cell lineage. This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. In particular, combinations of five or seven transcription factors enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell culture conditions and was enhanced by the addition of valproic acid and JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca(2+) transient oscillations in the reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming, contributing to the ongoing rational design of a robust protocol required for cardiac regenerative therapies."

The FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score, a new coma scale, evaluates 4 components: eye and motor responses, brainstem reflexes and respiration. We aimed to study the interobserver variability of the FOUR score in acute stroke patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with acute stroke admitted from February to July 2008 to the stroke unit of our Neurology Department. Patients were evaluated by neurology residents and nurses using the FOUR score and the GCS. For both scales, we obtained paired and total weighted kappa values (Kw) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). NIH stroke scale was also recorded on admission. RESULTS: We obtained a total of 75 paired evaluations in 60 patients (41 cerebral infarctions, 15 cerebral hemorrhages and 4 transient ischemic attacks). Thirty-three (55%) patients were alert, 17 (28.3%) drowsy and 10 (16.7%) stuporous or comatose. The overall rater agreement was excellent in the FOUR score (Kw 0.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.97) with an ICC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96) and in the GCS (Kw 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98) with an ICC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.97). A good correlation was found between the FOUR score and the GCS (rho 0.83; p < 0.01) and between the FOUR score and the NIH stroke scale (rho -0.78; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FOUR score is a reliable scale for evaluating the level of consciousness in acute stroke patients, showing a good correlation with the GCS and the NIH stroke scale."

In 32D/EGFR myeloid and MCF10A breast cells, soluble amphiregulin (AR), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1), neuregulin 2 beta, and epigen stimulate greater EGFR coupling to cell proliferation and DNA synthesis than do EGF, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and epiregulin. EGF competitively antagonizes AR, indicating that its functional differences reflect dissimilar intrinsic activity at EGFR. EGF stimulates much greater phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr1045 than does AR. Moreover, the EGFR Y1045F mutation and z-cbl dominant-negative mutant of the c-cbl ubiquitin ligase potentiate the effect of EGF but not of AR. Both EGF and AR stimulate phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr992. However, the EGFR Y992F mutation and phospholipase C gamma inhibitor U73122 reduce the effect of AR much more than that of EGF. Expression of TGF\u03b1 in 32D/EGFR cells causes greater EGFR coupling to cell proliferation than does expression of EGF. Moreover, expression of EGF in 32D/EGFR cells causes these cells to be largely refractory to stimulation with soluble EGF. Thus, EGFR ligands are functionally distinct in models of paracrine and autocrine signaling and EGFR coupling to biological responses may be specified by competition among functionally distinct EGFR ligands."

INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heritable disorder with male predilection, suggesting a sex chromosome defect in certain patients. Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait. This study sought to identify the genetic basis for male-restricted, nonsyndromic sinus node dysfunction and AF in a multigenerational family. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genealogical and medical records, and DNA samples, were obtained. Progressive SND and AF occurred in four males related through maternal lineages, consistent with X-linked inheritance. Skeletal myopathy was absent, even at advanced ages. Targeted X chromosome genotyping mapped the disease locus to Xq28, implicating EMD as a positional candidate gene. DNA sequencing revealed hemizygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in EMD (Lys37del) in affected males, disrupting a residue within the LEM binding domain critical for nuclear assembly but leaving the remainder of the protein intact. Buccal epithelial cell staining with emerin antibody demonstrated near-total functional loss of emerin. Female relatives underwent prospective electrocardiographic and genetic testing. Those heterozygous for Lys37del had approximately 50-70% emerin-positive nuclei and variable degrees of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of EMD can underlie X-linked familial AF. Lys37del is associated with epithelial cell emerin deficiency, as in EDMD, yet it causes electrical atriomyopathy in the absence of skeletal muscle disease. Targeted genetic testing of EMD should be considered in patients with SND-associated AF and/or family history suggesting X-linked inheritance."

Ergosterol starvation leads to an 8-16-fold increase in ERG2 gene expression. Such an increase was also observed in wild-type cells either grown anaerobically or treated with SR31747A a sterol isomerase inhibitor. Exogenously-supplied zymosterol is entirely transformed into ergosterol, which represses ERG2 transcription. By contrast, exogenously-supplied ergosterol has little or no effect on ERG2 transcription."

The 620W allele of PTPN22 has been associated with susceptibility to several different forms of chronic inflammatory disease, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). We set out to explore its possible role in two other inflammatory diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease (CD). In our cohort of 496 MS trios from the United Kingdom, we observed reduced transmission of the PTPN22 620W allele. The CD sample consisted of 169 trios as well as 249 cases of CD with their 207 matched control subjects collected in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada; there was also no evidence of association between the PTPN22 620W allele and susceptibility for CD. Pooled analyses combining our data with published data assessed a total of 1496 cases of MS and 1019 cases of CD but demonstrated no evidence of association with either disease. Given the modest odds ratios of known risk alleles for inflammatory diseases, these analyses do not exclude a role for the PTPN22 allele in susceptibility to CD or MS, but they do suggest that such a putative role would probably be more modest than that reported so far in T1D, RA, SLE, and AIT."

It confronts objections that the approach is simplistic, incompatible with a virtue-based approach to medicine, that it requires respect for autonomy always to have priority when the principles clash at the expense of clinical obligations to benefit patients and global justice. It agrees that the approach does not provide universalisable methods either for resolving such moral dilemmas arising from conflict between the principles or their derivatives, or universalisable methods for resolving disagreements about the scope of these principles-long acknowledged lacunae but arguably to be found, in practice, with all other approaches to medical ethics. The value of the approach, when properly understood, is to provide a universalisable though prima facie set of moral commitments which all doctors can accept, a basic moral language and a basic moral analytic framework. These can underpin an intercultural 'moral mission statement' for the goals and practice of medicine."

DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of related proteins that both catalyze the de novo formation of 5-methylcytosine and maintain these methylation marks in cell-specific patterns in virtually all mitotic cells of the body. In the adult brain, methylation occurs in progenitor cells of the neurogenic zones and in postmitotic neurons. Of the DNMTs, DNMT1 and DNMT3a are most highly expressed in postmitotic neurons. While it has been commonly thought all postmitotic neurons and glia express DNMTs at comparable levels, the coexpression of selected DNMTs with markers of distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes has not been previously examined in detail in the mouse. To this end, we analyzed the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a along with GAD67 in the brains of the glutamic acid decarboxylase67-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) knockin mice. After first confirming that GFP-immunopositive neurons were also GAD67-positive, we showed that in the motor cortex, piriform cortex, striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA), GFP immunofluorescence coincided with the signal corresponding to DNMT1 and DNMT3a. A detailed examination of cortical neurons, showed that = 30% of NeuN-immunopositive neurons were also DNMT1-positive. These data do not exclude the expression of DNMT1 or DNMT3a in glutamatergic neurons and glia. However, they suggest that their expression is low compared with the levels present in GABAergic neurons."

The cytoskeleton is a complex of detergent-insoluble components of the cytoplasm playing critical roles in cell motility, shape generation, and mechanical properties of a cell. Fibrillar polymers-actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments-are major constituents of the cytoskeleton, which constantly change their organization during cellular activities. The actin cytoskeleton is especially polymorphic, as actin filaments can form multiple higher order assemblies performing different functions. Structural information about cytoskeleton organization is critical for understanding its functions and mechanisms underlying various forms of cellular activity. Because of the nanometer-scale thickness of cytoskeletal fibers, electron microscopy (EM) is a key tool to determine the structure of the cytoskeleton. This article describes application of rotary shadowing (or metal replica) EM for visualization of the cytoskeleton. The procedure is applicable to thin cultured cells growing on glass coverslips and consists of detergent extraction of cells to expose their cytoskeleton, chemical fixation to provide stability, ethanol dehydration and critical point drying to preserve three-dimensionality, rotary shadowing with platinum to create contrast, and carbon coating to stabilize replicas. This technique provides easily interpretable three-dimensional images, in which individual cytoskeletal fibers are clearly resolved, and individual proteins can be identified by immunogold labeling. More importantly, replica EM is easily compatible with live cell imaging, so that one can correlate the dynamics of a cell or its components, e.g., expressed fluorescent proteins, with high resolution structural organization of the cytoskeleton in the same cell."

We have recently described the presence of a high proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (20%) with an increased mutation frequency (mutators) in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In four out of 11 independent P. aeruginosa strains, the high mutation frequency was found to be complemented with the wild-type mutS gene from P. aeruginosa PAO1. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of two additional P. aeruginosa mismatch repair genes and the characterization, by complementation of deficient strains, of these two putative P. aeruginosa mismatch repair genes (mutL and uvrD). We also describe the alterations in the mutS, mutL and uvrD genes responsible for the mutator phenotype of hypermutable P. aeruginosa strains isolated from CF patients. Seven out of the 11 mutator strains were found to be defective in the MMR system (four mutS, two mutL and one uvrD). In four cases (three mutS and one mutL), the genes contained frameshift mutations. The fourth mutS strain showed a 3.3 kb insertion after the 10th nucleotide of the mutS gene, and a 54 nucleotide deletion between two eight nucleotide direct repeats. This deletion, involving domain II of MutS, was found to be the main one responsible for mutS inactivation. The second mutL strain presented a K310M mutation, equivalent to K307 in Escherichia coli MutL, a residue known to be essential for its ATPase activity. Finally, the uvrD strain had three amino acid substitutions within the conserved ATP binding site of the deduced UvrD polypeptide, showing defective mismatch repair activity. Interestingly, cells carrying this mutant allele exhibited a fully active UvrABC-mediated excision repair. The results shown here indicate that the putative P. aeruginosa mutS, mutL and uvrD genes are mutator genes and that their alteration results in a mutator phenotype."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score). However, some patients have strokes despite a low predicted risk according to these scores. We designed the ABCDE+ score by adding the variables 'etiology' and ischaemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) -'DWI-positivity'- to the ABCD-score. We hypothesized that this refinement increases the predictability of recurrent ischaemic events. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study amongst all consecutive TIA patients in a university hospital emergency department. Area under the computed receiver-operating curves (AUCs) were used to compare the predictive values of the scores with regard to the outcome stroke or recurrent TIA within 90 days. RESULTS: Amongst 248 patients, 33 (13.3%, 95%-CI 9.3-18.2%) had a stroke (n = 13) or a recurrent TIA (n = 20). Patients with recurrent ischaemic events more often had large-artery atherosclerosis as the cause for TIA (46% vs. 14%, P < 0.001) and positive DWI (61% vs. 35%; P = 0.01) compared with patients without recurrent events. Patients with and those without events did not differ with regard to age, clinical symptoms, duration, blood pressure, risk factors, and stroke preventive treatment. The comparison of AUCs [95%CI] showed superiority of the ABCDE+ score (0.67[0.55-0.75]) compared to the ABCD(2) -score (0.48[0.37-0.58]; P = 0.04) and a trend toward superiority compared to the ABCD-score (0.50[0.40-0.61]; P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In TIA patients, the addition of the variables 'etiology' and 'DWI-positivity' to the ABCD-score seems to enhance the predictability of subsequent cerebral ischaemic events."

The high mortality of this disease is due to late diagnosis in over 70% of ovarian cancer cases. A class of small noncoding RNAs, or microRNAs, was found to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Some, but not all, of the data indicated that the miR-200 family was dysregulated in a variety of malignancies. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200a and E-cadherin were significantly upregulated in EOC compared to benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovarian tissues. However, further stratification of the subject indicated that the expression levels of miR-200a were significantly downregulated in late-stage (FIGO III+V) and grade 3 groups compared with early stage (FIGO I+II) and grade 1 to 2 groups. Similarly, relatively low levels of miR-200a were observed in the lymph compared to the node-negative group. E-cadherin expression was found to be absent in normal ovarian tissue and was frequently expressed in benign epithelial ovarian cysts, with absence or low levels observed in late-stage ovarian cancers. There was a significantly positive correlation between miR-200a and E-cadherin in EOC. The biphasic expression pattern suggested that miR-200a levels may serve as novel biomarkers for the early detection of EOC, and miR-200a and E-cadherin are candidate targets for the development of new treatment modalities against ovarian cancer."

The reprogramming of adult cells into pluripotent cells or directly into alternative adult cell types holds great promise for regenerative medicine. We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here we use genetic lineage tracing to show that resident non-myocytes in the murine heart can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo by local delivery of GMT after coronary ligation. Induced cardiomyocytes became binucleate, assembled sarcomeres and had cardiomyocyte-like gene expression. Analysis of single cells revealed ventricular cardiomyocyte-like action potentials, beating upon electrical stimulation, and evidence of electrical coupling. In vivo delivery of GMT decreased infarct size and modestly attenuated cardiac dysfunction up to 3 months after coronary ligation. Delivery of the pro-angiogenic and fibroblast-activating peptide, thymosin b4, along with GMT, resulted in further improvements in scar area and cardiac function. These findings demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in their native environment for potential regenerative purposes."

Pheochromocytoma by definition produces and secretes catecholamines. Similar tumours that do not secrete active substances of any kind are called non functioning paragangliomas. The hallmark clinical manifestation of pheochromocytoma is hypertension accompanied with various signs and symptoms in excess of catecholamines or other bioactive substances. The early diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is important not only because it offers the possibility of curing hypertension but also because unrecognised pheochromocytoma is a potentially lethal condition. The aim of this article is to stress the specify of the clinical finding, diagnostical values of the laboratory tests and possibilities of morphological localizing techniques in a series of 98 patients with surgically proven pheochromocytoma. RESULTS: Over the period from 1954 to 2002 pheochromocytoma was diagnosed and surgically treated in 98 patients. The diagnosis was confirmed at operation except in patients who refused operation or continued the examination in other Clinical wards. There were 59 females and 48 males (F:M = 1.23:1), the age ranged from 7 to 64 years with the pick incidence in the second and third decades of life in males and the third and fourth decades of life in females. The basic clinical characteristic was hypertension which was found in 94% of patients with an approximately equal frequency of fixed and paroxysmal hypertension cases. The most often accompanning manifestations were headache (62%), perspiration (61%) and palpitations (65%). A high level of vanyl mandelic acid (VMA) and free catecholamines in 24-hour urine collection confirmed the diagnosis in 94% of cases. In boderline cases we performed dynamic tests, the most relevant among them being the test with phentolamin. It was positive in 95% of patients. Retropneumothomography contributed to a successful localisation of tumour in 83% of cases. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 69 patients and was positive in 97% of them. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) localized the tumour in all 16 patient in whom it was performed. The whole body MIBG-J-131 (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scanes were positive in 92% (45/49) and false negative in the remainder of 8% (4/49) of cases. Selective angiography was performed in 40 patients and in all it was positive. DISCUSSION: Although pheochromocytomas were among the first recognized adrenal tumours, the prompt and safe diagnosis is mandatory up to date. The average annual incidence has been estimated by several epidemiologic studies to range from 0.8 to between 1.55 and 2.1 million persons per year. It is reported that it is curable cause of hypertension in 0.1% to 1% of cases. Pheochromocytoma has been classified as a \"10% tumour\" because various studies have shown that each of the characteristics mentioned bellow occurs with a frequency of approximately 10%: bilateral, extra-adrenal, multiple, malignant, familial and occurring in children. Our series of patients has a similar distribution: pheochromocytoma was in 9.2% of patients extra-adrenal, in 7.1% bilateral, in 9.2% multiple and in 4.08% malignant. Hypertension was the constant finding in 94% of our patients. Three clinical patterns of hypertenson have been observed. The first is paroxysmal hypertension, and the others are fixed or combinations of fixed and paroxysmal hypertension. According to our experience there were the equal incidence of all forms of hypertension. We noticed, like others, when the triad of headache, sweating and palpitations is accompanied by hypertension, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be made with specify and sensitivity over 93%. In absence of this finding the diagnosis can be excluded with certainty of 99%. As a specify of the clinical finding, we mention two patients with manifestations of hypercorticism, two patients with pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder, and four with MEN syndrome (one with MEN 2A and three with MEN 2B). For confirming the diagnosis the most relevant laboratory test was the higher level of VMA and free catecholamines in 24-hour urine collections. Once pheochromocytoma has been diagnosed by biochemical analyses, the anatomic location of the tumour or tumors must be determined. Currently, the best approach is to obtain MIBG-J-131 scan and then to perform MRI or CT of the abdomen and other areas identified on MIBG scan in order to provide more accurate spatial information. With this approach the great majority of pheochromocytomas can be localized. CONCLUSION: There is no classic picture, no stereotype for pheochromocytoma, although the history and physical finding are helpful. Patients come to the clinician in a variety of ways and settings. They may have classic attacks of hypertension accompanied with headache, perspiration and paplpitations or they may have identical symptoms and physical findings as the patients with primary hypertension. On the other hand, they may have signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hypercalcaemia, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, malignant hypertension or a variety of other conditions. Rarely, they have no complaints at all. Once the diagnosis was made, spatial localizing of the tumour or tumours, and surgical treatment are necessary. Unrecognized disease may be fatal."

These patients face reduced quality of life, high risk of suicide, and little hope of recovery.

First clinical studies with small samples have been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Long-term antidepressant effects, augmentation of social functioning, and normalization of brain metabolism have been shown in about 50% of patients. Cognitive safety regarding attention, learning, and memory has been reported. Adverse events were wound infection, suicide, and hypomania, amongst others. Larger studies are under way to confirm these preliminary encouraging results. New hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to be assessed in clinical trials. The application of DBS for other psychiatric diseases (e.g., bipolar disorder, alcohol dependency, opioid addiction, schizophrenia) is debated and single case studies are under way. Standards are needed for study registration, target selection, patient inclusion and monitoring, and publication of results to guarantee safety for the patients and scientific exchange."

The phosphorylation of rat cardiac microsomal proteins was investigated with special attention to the effects of okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases), inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 1 and inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). The results showed that okadaic acid (5 microM) modestly but reproducibly augmented the protein kinase A-catalyzed phospholamban (PLN) phosphorylation, although exerted little effect on the calcium/calmodulin kinase-catalyzed PLN phosphorylation. Microsomes contained three other substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were phosphorylated by protein kinase A but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase. The protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of these three substrates was markedly (2-3 fold) increased by 5 microM okadaic acid. Calmodulin was found to antagonize the action of okadaic acid on such phosphorylation. Protein kinase A inhibitor was found to decrease the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of microsomal polypeptides. Unexpectedly, inhibitor 2 was also found to markedly decrease protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban as well these other microsomal substrates. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. Protein phosphatase 2B is also capable of dephosphorylating these three substrates."

To facilitate studies of neural network architecture and formation, we generated three Drosophila melanogaster variants of the mouse Brainbow-2 system, called Flybow. Sequences encoding different membrane-tethered fluorescent proteins were arranged in pairs within cassettes flanked by recombination sites. Flybow combines the Gal4-upstream activating sequence binary system to regulate transgene expression and an inducible modified Flp-FRT system to drive inversions and excisions of cassettes. This provides spatial and temporal control over the stochastic expression of one of two or four reporters within one sample. Using the visual system, the embryonic nervous system and the wing imaginal disc, we show that Flybow in conjunction with specific Gal4 drivers can be used to visualize cell morphology with high resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this labeling approach is compatible with available Flp-FRT-based techniques, such as mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker; this could further support the genetic analysis of neural circuit assembly and function."

The endogenous thyroid hormones L-thyroxine (T(4)) and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)) induce angiogenesis via an endothelial cell iodothyronine receptor on integrin alphaVbeta3. This receptor also exists on platelets. Diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) and GC-1, a noniodinated thyroid hormone analog, also induce angiogenesis. Here we examined the effects of iodothyronines (L-T(4) vs L-T(3)) and analogs DITPA and GC-1 on human platelet function. Subthreshold aggregation of platelets obtained from healthy human donors was induced with collagen. Platelet activation (proaggregation) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) secretion (degranulation) induced by L-T( 4), L-T(4)-agarose, L-T(3), DITPA, or GC-1 were determined simultaneously. Platelet aggregation and ATP secretion induced by a subthreshold level of collagen were enhanced 3-fold by either L-T(4) or L-T( 4)-agarose (0.01 micromol/L) as compared to control, whereas, L-T( 3), DITPA, or GC-1 had no effect under the same conditions. The platelet proaggregatory and degranulation effects of L-T(4) were blocked by the alphavbeta3 antagonist XT199 (0.1 micromol/ L) and by tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac; 0.1 micromol/L). Tetrac inhibits binding of thyroid hormone analogs to the receptor on alphavbeta3 and lacks thyromimetic activity at this site; thus, the proaggregatory action of L-T(4) likely involves the cell surface receptor on integrin alphavbeta3. The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) on human platelets but not endothelial cells distinguishes among iodothyronines, reflecting quantitative differences in integrin sites on endothelial cells and platelets or qualitative differences in the phospholipids/protein microenvironment of endothelial and platelet membranes that can affect integrin function. Additional studies in different populations with larger sample sizes are warranted to determine the impact of the current findings on clinical interventions."

AREAS COVERED: We evaluated a recent Phase III clinical trial with dapagliflozin. EXPERT OPINION: Dapagliflozin was studied as add-on therapy to sitagliptin with or without metformin, and was shown to lower HbA1c levels and body weight. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low with dapagliflozin, but it did increase the incidence of urogenital infections. As no clear benefits have been identified for dapagliflozin over canagliflozin, which was the first gliflozin registered by the FDA, we do not fully understand why it was necessary to register dapagliflozin. Given that there are no completed cardiovascular/clinical outcome studies with dapagliflozin, and therefore no evidence of beneficial effect, it also seems premature to be using it extensively or considering it as an alternative to the clinically proven metformin."

BACKGROUND: Certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., rofecoxib [Vioxx]) increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and should be avoided in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. Rates of cardiovascular disease are high and rising in many low- and middle-income countries. We studied the extent to which evidence on cardiovascular risk with NSAIDs has translated into guidance and sales in 15 countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data on the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular events with individual NSAIDs were derived from meta-analyses of randomised trials and controlled observational studies. Listing of individual NSAIDs on Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) was obtained from the World Health Organization. NSAID sales or prescription data for 15 low-, middle-, and high-income countries were obtained from Intercontinental Medical Statistics Health (IMS Health) or national prescription pricing audit (in the case of England and Canada). Three drugs (rofecoxib, diclofenac, etoricoxib) ranked consistently highest in terms of cardiovascular risk compared with nonuse. Naproxen was associated with a low risk. Diclofenac was listed on 74 national EMLs, naproxen on just 27. Rofecoxib use was not documented in any country. Diclofenac and etoricoxib accounted for one-third of total NSAID usage across the 15 countries (median 33.2%, range 14.7-58.7%). This proportion did not vary between low- and high-income countries. Diclofenac was by far the most commonly used NSAID, with a market share close to that of the next three most popular drugs combined. Naproxen had an average market share of less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Listing of NSAIDs on national EMLs should take account of cardiovascular risk, with preference given to low risk drugs. Diclofenac has a risk very similar to rofecoxib, which was withdrawn from worldwide markets owing to cardiovascular toxicity. Diclofenac should be removed from EMLs."

SUMMARY: The annotation of membrane proteins in proteomes is an important problem of Computational Biology, especially after the development of high-throughput techniques that allow fast and efficient genome sequencing. Among membrane proteins, transmembrane \u03b2-barrels (TMBBs) are poorly represented in the database of protein structures (PDB) and difficult to identify with experimental approaches. They are, however, extremely important, playing key roles in several cell functions and bacterial pathogenicity. TMBBs are included in the lipid bilayer with a \u03b2-barrel structure and are presently found in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology. Here, we present our BETAWARE program that includes both approaches and can run as a standalone program on a linux-based computer to easily address in-home massive protein annotation or filtering.

The reprogramming of adult cells into pluripotent cells or directly into alternative adult cell types holds great promise for regenerative medicine. We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT). Here we use genetic lineage tracing to show that resident non-myocytes in the murine heart can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo by local delivery of GMT after coronary ligation. Induced cardiomyocytes became binucleate, assembled sarcomeres and had cardiomyocyte-like gene expression. Analysis of single cells revealed ventricular cardiomyocyte-like action potentials, beating upon electrical stimulation, and evidence of electrical coupling. In vivo delivery of GMT decreased infarct size and modestly attenuated cardiac dysfunction up to 3 months after coronary ligation. Delivery of the pro-angiogenic and fibroblast-activating peptide, thymosin b4, along with GMT, resulted in further improvements in scar area and cardiac function. These findings demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocyte-like cells in their native environment for potential regenerative purposes."

CONTEXT: Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare condition compromising the clinical triad of acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be associated with a variety of etiologies, and chemotherapeutic agents have also been reported to be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, including mitomycin, cisplatin, bleomycin, and most recently gemcitabine. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old Caucasian male treated with four cycles of gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 developed clinical and laboratory findings compatible with hemolytic uremic syndrome. He developed microangiopathic hemolysis, rapidly declining renal function with proteinuria and hematuria, and renal biopsy revealed thrombotic microangiopathy. Hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, and corticosteroid therapy were utilized but the process ultimately was irreversible. CONCLUSION: With multiple reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome complicating gemcitabine therapy, it is imperative that clinicians heighten their awareness of this potentially lethal complication."

Ependymal cells are multiciliated cells located in the wall of the lateral ventricles of the adult mammalian brain and are key components of the subependymal zone niche, where adult neural stem cells reside. Through the movement of their motile cilia, ependymal cells control the cerebrospinal fluid flow within the ventricular system from which they receive secreted molecules and morphogens controlling self-renewal and differentiation decisions of adult neural stem cells. Multiciliated ependymal cells become fully differentiated at postnatal stages however they are specified during mid to late embryogenesis from a population of radial glial cells. Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1."

Scoring, the process of selecting the biologically relevant solution from a pool of generated conformations, is one of the major challenges in the field of biomolecular docking. A prominent way to cope with this challenge is to incorporate information-based terms into the scoring function. Within this context, low-resolution shape data obtained from either ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) or SAXS experiments have been integrated into the conventional scoring function of the information-driven docking program HADDOCK. Here, the strengths and weaknesses of IM-MS-based and SAXS-based scoring, either in isolation or in combination with the HADDOCK score, are systematically assessed. The results of an analysis of a large docking decoy set composed of dimers generated by running HADDOCK in ab initio mode reveal that the content of the IM-MS data is of too low resolution for selecting correct models, while scoring with SAXS data leads to a significant improvement in performance. However, the effectiveness of SAXS scoring depends on the shape and the arrangement of the complex, with prolate and oblate systems showing the best performance. It is observed that the highest accuracy is achieved when SAXS scoring is combined with the energy-based HADDOCK score."

An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

In 2010, BMSB populations in the mid-Atlantic United States reached outbreak levels and subsequent feeding severely damaged tree fruit as well as other crops. Significant nuisance issues from adults overwintering inside homes were common. BMSB is a highly polyphagous species with a strong dispersal capacity and high reproductive output, potentially enabling its spread and success in invaded regions. A greater understanding of BMSB biology and ecology and its natural enemies, the identification of the male-produced aggregation pheromone, and the recognition that BMSB disperses into crops from adjacent wooded habitats have led to the development of behavior-based integrated pest management (IPM) tactics. Much is still unknown about BMSB, and continued long-term collaborative studies are necessary to refine crop-specific IPM programs and enhance biological control across invaded landscapes."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the developed world and is associated with a fivefold increase in the risk of stroke, accounting for up to 15% of strokes in the general population. The European Society of Cardiology now recommends direct oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, in preference to vitamin K antagonist therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with A F. This review focuses on the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, summarizing the properties that make rivaroxaban appropriate for anticoagulant therapy in this indication (including its predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and once-daily dosing regimen) and describing data from the Phase III ROCKET AF trial, which showed once-daily rivaroxaban to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. In this trial, similar rates of major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed; however, when compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban was associated with clinically significant reductions in intracranial and fatal bleeding. On the basis of these results, rivaroxaban was approved in both the United States and the European Union for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Subanalyses of ROCKET AF data showed rivaroxaban to have consistent efficacy and safety across a wide range of patients, and studies to confirm these results in real-world settings are underway. This review also describes practical considerations for treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical practice (including dose reductions in specific high-risk patients, eg, those with renal impairment), recommendations for the transition from vitamin K antagonists to rivaroxaban, the management of bleeding events, and the measurement of rivaroxaban exposure."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score). However, some patients have strokes despite a low predicted risk according to these scores. We designed the ABCDE+ score by adding the variables 'etiology' and ischaemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) -'DWI-positivity'- to the ABCD-score. We hypothesized that this refinement increases the predictability of recurrent ischaemic events. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study amongst all consecutive TIA patients in a university hospital emergency department. Area under the computed receiver-operating curves (AUCs) were used to compare the predictive values of the scores with regard to the outcome stroke or recurrent TIA within 90 days. RESULTS: Amongst 248 patients, 33 (13.3%, 95%-CI 9.3-18.2%) had a stroke (n = 13) or a recurrent TIA (n = 20). Patients with recurrent ischaemic events more often had large-artery atherosclerosis as the cause for TIA (46% vs. 14%, P < 0.001) and positive DWI (61% vs. 35%; P = 0.01) compared with patients without recurrent events. Patients with and those without events did not differ with regard to age, clinical symptoms, duration, blood pressure, risk factors, and stroke preventive treatment. The comparison of AUCs [95%CI] showed superiority of the ABCDE+ score (0.67[0.55-0.75]) compared to the ABCD(2) -score (0.48[0.37-0.58]; P = 0.04) and a trend toward superiority compared to the ABCD-score (0.50[0.40-0.61]; P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In TIA patients, the addition of the variables 'etiology' and 'DWI-positivity' to the ABCD-score seems to enhance the predictability of subsequent cerebral ischaemic events."

MOTIVATION: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a dominant approach for large-scale high-throughput post-translational modification (PTM) profiling. Although current state-of-the-art blind PTM spectral analysis algorithms can predict thousands of modified peptides (PTM predictions) in an MS/MS experiment, a significant percentage of these predictions have inaccurate modification mass estimates and false modification site assignments. This problem can be addressed by post-processing the PTM predictions with a PTM refinement algorithm. We developed a novel PTM refinement algorithm, iPTMClust, which extends a recently introduced PTM refinement algorithm PTMClust and uses a non-parametric Bayesian model to better account for uncertainties in the quantity and identity of PTMs in the input data. The use of this new modeling approach enables iPTMClust to provide a confidence score per modification site that allows fine-tuning and interpreting resulting PTM predictions. RESULTS: The primary goal behind iPTMClust is to improve the quality of the PTM predictions. First, to demonstrate that iPTMClust produces sensible and accurate cluster assignments, we compare it with k-means clustering, mixtures of Gaussians (MOG) and PTMClust on a synthetically generated PTM dataset. Second, in two separate benchmark experiments using PTM data taken from a phosphopeptide and a yeast proteome study, we show that iPTMClust outperforms state-of-the-art PTM prediction and refinement algorithms, including PTMClust. Finally, we illustrate the general applicability of our new approach on a set of human chromatin protein complex data, where we are able to identify putative novel modified peptides and modification sites that may be involved in the formation and regulation of protein complexes. Our method facilitates accurate PTM profiling, which is an important step in understanding the mechanisms behind many biological processes and should be an integral part of any proteomic study. AVAILABILITY: Our algorithm is implemented in Java and is freely available for academic use from http://genes.toronto.edu.

The C-terminal IBR-RING domain of parkin and the C-terminal part of alpha4 were essential for the interaction. Biochemical studies revealed that alpha4 was not a substrate for parkin-dependent ubiquitylation. Putative functions of the interaction might therefore be substrate presentation to the proteasome or regulation of proteasomal activity.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear. DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation of three patient groups. SETTINGS: Disease-specific symptoms were reviewed among referred patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Finland and in members of a Finnish M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Association in Finland. The MRI of a separate group of patients was undertaken in a tertiary referral centre in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 340 patients were reviewed in the referral hospital along with 740 members of the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Association. MRI was undertaken in 224 patients in Japan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Latency and symptom development in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and the appearance of EH of the inner ear in monosymptomatic patients and in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. RESULTS: The mean age of the first symptom was 43.8 years, with 10% of the patients being older than 65 years. The time delay between hearing loss and vertigo was more than 5 years in 20% of the members and of the patients. Gadolinium-contrasted MRI demonstrated EH in 90% of the patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, in which 75% was bilateral among patients with unilateral symptoms. In monosymptomatic patients with vertigo, tinnitus or hearing loss; EH was demonstrated in 55-90% of the patients either in the cochlea and/or the vestibulum of the symptomatic ear. CONCLUSIONS: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease often shows bilateral EH and comprises a continuum from a monosymptomatic disease to the typical symptom complex of the disease. We suggest that a 3T MRI measurement should be carried out in patients with sensory-neural hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus, 4 h after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-contrast agent to verify the inner ear pathology. This may lead to a better management of the condition."

Heterodimeric transcription factors, including the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein ATF-2-c-jun, are well-characterized components of an enhanceosome that mediates virus induction of the human beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene. Here we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). We demonstrate that correct orientation of the ATF-2-c-jun binding site is required for virus induction of the IFN-beta gene and for IRF-3-dependent activation of a composite ATF-2- c-jun-IRF site in the IFN-beta promoter. We also show that in vitro the DNA-bound ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer adopts a fixed orientation upon the binding of IRF-3 at an adjacent site in the IFN-beta enhancer and that the DNA-binding domain of IRF-3 is sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, we show that the DNA-binding domain of ATF-2 is necessary and sufficient for selective protein-protein interactions with IRF-3. Strikingly, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with IFN-beta reporter constructs reveal that recruitment of IRF-3 to the IFN-beta promoter upon virus infection is dependent on the orientation of the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binding site. These observations demonstrate functional and physical cooperativity between the bZIP and IRF transcription factor families and illustrate the critical role of heterodimeric transcription factors in formation of the IFN-beta enhanceosome."

It interacts with components of the NPC via its C-terminal domain (CTD), which follows a transmembrane domain and a massive ( approximately 200 kDa) N-terminal region that resides in the lumen of the perinuclear space. Here, we report the solution structure of the human gp210 CTD as determined by various spectroscopic techniques. In water, the CTD adopts an extended, largely unordered conformation, which contains a significant amount of left-handed polyproline type II (PII) helical structure. The conformation of the CTD is altered by high pH, charged detergents, and the hydrogen bond-promoting reagent trifluoroethanol (TFE), which decrease the PII fraction of the fragment. TFE also induces a conformational change in a region containing an SPXX motif whose serine becomes specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. We propose that PII elements in the CTD may play a role in its interaction with the NPC and may serve as recognition sites for regulatory proteins bearing WW or other, unknown PII-binding motifs."

Patients are first randomised between ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and DHAP (dexamethasone, ara-C and cisplatin), both combined with rituximab (R-ICE or R-DHAP). After three courses, responders are treated by ASCT with BEAM. A second randomisation then allocates patients to maintenance treatment with rituximab 375 mg/m(2), one injection every 2 months six times, or observation. Accrual to the study is now proceeding well and the planned 400 patients are likely to be enrolled within the next 1.5 years. Results to date are very preliminary but suggest encouraging rates of response. However, they also indicate that initial exposure to rituximab may increase the difficulty of salvaging patients who fail first-line therapy."

          "context": "Implications of cellular senescence in tissue damage response, tumor suppression, and stem cell biology. Cellular senescence is characterized by an irreversible cell cycle arrest that, when bypassed by mutation, contributes to cellular immortalization. Activated oncogenes induce a hyperproliferative response, which might be one of the senescence cues. We have found that expression of such an oncogene, Akt, causes senescence in primary mouse hepatoblasts in vitro. Additionally, AKT-driven tumors undergo senescence in vivo following p53 reactivation and show signs of differentiation. In another in vivo system, i.e., liver fibrosis, hyperproliferative signaling through AKT might be a driving force of the senescence in activated hepatic stellate cells. Senescent cells up-regulate and secrete molecules that, on the one hand, can reinforce the arrest and, on the other hand, can signal to an innate immune system to clear the senescent cells. The mechanisms governing senescence and immortalization are overlapping with those regulating self-renewal and differentiation. These respective control mechanisms, or their disregulation, are involved in multiple pathological conditions including fibrosis, wound healing, and cancer. Understanding extracellular cues that regulate these processes may enable new therapies for these conditions."

The nuclear pore complex is the predominant structure in the nuclear envelope that spans the double nuclear membranes of all eukaryotes. Yeasts have one additional organelle that is also embedded in the nuclear envelope: the spindle pole body, which functions as the microtubule organizing center. The only protein known to localize to and be important in the assembly of both of these yeast structures is the integral membrane protein, Ndc1p. However, no homologues of Ndc1p had been characterized in metazoa. Here, we identify and analyze NDC1 homologues that are conserved throughout evolution. We show that the overall topology of these homologues is conserved. Each contains six transmembrane segments in its N-terminal half and has a large soluble C-terminal half of approximately 300 amino acids. Charge distribution analysis infers that the N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytoplasm. Limited proteolysis of yeast Ndc1p in cellular membranes confirms the orientation of its C-terminus. Although it is not known whether vertebrate NDC1 protein localizes to nuclear pores like its yeast counterpart, the human homologue contains three FG repeats in the C-terminus, a feature of many nuclear pore proteins. Moreover, a small region containing mutations that affect assembly of the nuclear pore in yeast is highly conserved throughout evolution. Lastly, we bring together data from another study to demonstrate that the human homologue of NDC1 is the known inner nuclear membrane protein, NET3."

OBJECTIVES: Perry syndrome consists of autosomal dominant Parkinsonism, depression, weight loss, and central hypoventilation. Eight mutations in 16 families have been reported: p.F52L, p.G67D, p.G71R, p.G71E, p.G71A, p.T72P, p.Q74P, and p.Y78C located in exon 2 of the dynactin 1 (DCTN1) gene on chromosome 2p13.1. METHODS: Genealogical, clinical, genetic, and functional studies were performed in three kindreds from New Zealand, the United States, and Colombia. A diaphragmatic pacemaker was implanted in the proband from the Colombian family to treat her respiratory insufficiency. Dopaminergic therapy was initiated in probands from two families. RESULTS: Besides the probands, 17 symptomatic relatives from all families were identified. The cardinal signs of Perry syndrome were present in all three probands with symptomatic disease onset in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Parkinsonism was moderate with a partial response to dopaminergic treatment. All affected persons but two died of respiratory insufficiency. The proband from the Colombian family is alive most likely due to early diagnosis and implantation of a diaphragmatic pacemaker. Two-and-a-half-year follow-up examination has revealed that the diaphragmatic pacemaker is optimally functioning without any major complications. In the Colombian and US families, the DCTN1 p.G71R and in the New Zealand family the DCTN1 p.Y78C mutations were identified. In functional assays, both mutations altered microtubule binding consistent with a pathogenic role. CONCLUSIONS: Perry syndrome is a rare condition, but new cases are expected to be diagnosed worldwide. Early diagnosis prevents life-threatening acute respiratory failure. Diaphragmatic pacemakers should be considered as an effective symptomatic treatment option."

The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (\u03b1)-granules in platelets. The genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. We studied 11 consecutive families with inherited macrothrombocytopenia of unknown origin and \u03b1-granule deficiency. All of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the \u03b1-granule content by immunofluorescence analysis for \u03b1-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9 novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations, as well as nucleotide substitutions that altered the splicing mechanisms as determined at the RNA level. All the individuals with NBEAL2 biallelic mutations showed almost complete absence of platelet \u03b1-granules. Interestingly, the 13 individuals assumed to be asymptomatic because carriers of a mutated allele had platelet macrocytosis and significant reduction of the \u03b1-granule content. However, they were not thrombocytopenic. In the remaining 7 probands, we did not identify any NBEAL2 alterations, suggesting that other genetic defect(s) are responsible for their platelet phenotype. Of note, these patients were characterized by a lower severity of the \u03b1-granule deficiency than individuals with two NBEAL2 mutated alleles. Our data extend the spectrum of mutations responsible for gray platelet syndrome and demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia with \u03b1-granule deficiency is a genetic heterogeneous trait. In terms of practical applications, the screening of NBEAL2 is worthwhile only in patients with macrothrombocytopenia and severe reduction of the \u03b1-granules. Finally, individuals carrying one NBEAL2 mutated allele have mild laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that even haploinsufficiency has an effect on platelet phenotype."

Here we studied the genes involved in DNA methylation in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) allotetraploid containing S and T genomes inherited from Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis progenitors. To determine the inheritance of DNA methyltransferase genes and their expression patterns we examined three major DNA methyltransferase families (MET1, CMT3 and DRM) from tobacco and the progenitor species. Using Southern blot hybridization and PCR-based methods (genomic CAPS), we found that the parental loci of these gene families are retained in tobacco. Homoeologous expression was found in all tissues examined (leaf, root, flower) suggesting that DNA methyltransferase genes were probably not themselves targets of uniparental epigenetic silencing for over thousands of generations of allotetraploid evolution. The level of CG and CHG methylation of selected high-copy repeated sequences was similar and high in tobacco and its diploid progenitors. We speculate that natural selection might favor additive expression of parental DNA methyltransferase genes maintaining high levels of DNA methylation in tobacco, which has a repeat-rich heterochromatic genome."

The aim of this work is to define the role of ANGPTL3 gene as determinant of the combined hypolipidemia phenotype in 2 large cohorts of 913 among American and Italian subjects with primary hypobetalipoproteinemia (total cholesterol<5th percentile). METHODS AND RESULTS: The combined hypolipidemia cut-offs were chosen according to total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels reported in the ANGPTL3 kindred described to date: total cholesterol levels, <2nd percentile and HDL-cholesterol, levels<2nd decile. Seventy-eight subjects with combined hypolipidemia were analyzed for ANGPTL3 and APOB genes. We identified nonsense and/or missense mutations in ANGPTL3 gene in 8 subjects; no mutations of the APOB gene were found. Mutated ANGPTL3 homozygous/compound heterozygous subjects showed a more severe biochemical phenotype compared to heterozygous or ANGPTL3 negative subjects, although ANGPTL3 heterozygotes did not differ from ANGPTL3 negative subjects. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that in a cohort of subjects with severe primary hypobetalipoproteinemia the prevalence of ANGPTL3 gene mutations responsible for a combined hypolipidemia phenotype is about 10%, whereas mutations of APOB gene are absent."

Participants had the option of voluntarily adopting an electronic patient diary to support their self-monitoring, which provided patients, nurses and clinicians with access to symptom and psycho-social data.

The paper presents data on technology adoption, electronic diary usage and, self-reported data quality, as well as examining the impact of the technology on hospitalisations (frequency and duration). The participants who chose to use the online patient diary continued their involvement with the project for the entire trial period (85% vs 54% completion). Participants were more likely to maintain use of the online patient diary than the paper diary. Both the groups experienced a positive improvement in their self-efficacy to self-manage their condition scores.

          "context": "WITHDRAWN: Tacrine for Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Tacrine is one of the first drugs to be widely marketed for the loss of memory and intellectual decline in Alzheimer's disease, often accompanied by abnormal behaviour and physical decline. The alleged success of tacrine in the treatment of these symptoms has been heralded as confirmation of the cholinergic theory of Alzheimer's disease. The efficacy of tacrine for symptoms of dementia remains controversial. This is reflected by the low rate of prescription of tacrine in countries where it is approved and the lack of approval by several regulatory authorities in Europe and elsewhere. The uncertainty about the efficacy of tacrine is due to the difficulties in interpretation of the results from the clinical trials. The reasons for this are the small effects of tacrine compared to placebo for all outcomes; the high incidence of adverse events; the lack of benefit observed in several trials; the use of cross-over designs and their associated methodological problems in a disease like dementia; the use of different measurement scales to assess outcome in different trials; and the problem of high dropout rates. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy of tacrine for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia Group Register of Clinical Trials was searched using the terms 'tacrine', 'tetrahydroaminoacridine' and 'THA' (see the Group's search strategy for full details). SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with tacrine was administered for more than a day and compared to placebo in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, pooled if appropriate and possible, and the pooled odds ratios (95%CI) or the average differences (95%CI) were estimated. Where possible, intention-to-treat data were used. MAIN RESULTS: This review produced no clear results. The results were compatible with tacrine producing improvement, no change or even harm for those with Alzheimer's disease. It was not possible to use many of the published results in a combined analysis. For measures of overall clinical improvement, the intention-to-treat analyses failed to detect any difference between tacrine and placebo (OR 0.87; 95%CI 0.61 - 1.23). Behavioural disturbance, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-noncognitive, failed to detect any difference between tacrine and placebo (SMD -0.04; 95%CI -0.52 - 0.43). For cognition function, the effect of tacrine was not statistically significantly different from placebo for the MiniMental State Examination score (0-30; high =good) (SMD 0.14; 95%CI -0.02 - 0.30) and was barely statistically significantly in favour of treatment for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive scale (SMD -0.22; 95%CI -0.32 - -0.13). Adverse events were not reported in a systematic way in the different trials, making formal comparison difficult. Raised serum liver enzymes was the major reason for withdrawal. The odds ratio for withdrawal due to an adverse event was significantly different from one, the control group experienced fewer events (OR 5.7; 95%CI 4.1-7.9). Gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea, anorexia, dyspepsia and abdominal pain) were the other major cause of adverse events and for withdrawal, and the odds ratio for withdrawal was also significantly different from one in favour of the control group (OR 3.8; 95%CI 2.8-5.1). No deaths were reported in any of the studies during the trial period, up to six months. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides no convincing evidence that tacrine is a useful treatment for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. However, as so few trials presented data in a format suitable for pooling, the results of this review may be modified when further data from all relevant trials are included. There is an urgent need for the independent evaluation of the data already existing in the trials but not accessible through published or grouped data. An independent meta-analysis of the individual-patient data is required. The results and conclusions of this update are unaltered by further searching as the additional studies do not add any further valid/eligible data."

We present BTMX (Beta barrel TransMembrane eXposure), a computational method to predict the exposure status (i.e. exposed to the bilayer or hidden in the protein structure) of transmembrane residues in transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs). BTMX predicts the exposure status of known TM residues with an accuracy of 84.2% over 2,225 residues and provides a confidence score for all predictions. Predictions made are in concert with the fact that hydrophobic residues tend to be more exposed to the bilayer. The biological relevance of the input parameters is also discussed. The highest prediction accuracy is obtained when a sliding window comprising three residues with similar C(\u03b1)-C(\u03b2) vector orientations is employed. The prediction accuracy of the BTMX method on a separate unseen non-redundant test dataset is 78.1%. By employing out-pointing residues that are exposed to the bilayer, we have identified various physico-chemical properties that show statistically significant differences between the beta strands located at the oligomeric interfaces compared to the non-oligomeric strands. The BTMX web server generates colored, annotated snake-plots as part of the prediction results and is available under the BTMX tab at http://service.bioinformatik.uni-saarland.de/tmx-site/. Exposure status prediction of TMB residues may be useful in 3D structure prediction of TMBs."

TAAR1 and other receptors of this family are expressed in several tissues, including the heart. Functional effects have been observed after administration of exogenous T(1)AM: in the isolated heart, a negative inotropic and chronotropic action was produced, and the resistance to ischemic injury was increased, possibly as a consequence of an action on intracellular calcium homeostasis. Extracardiac effects include reduction of body temperature, increased lipid versus carbohydrate metabolism, and modulation of insulin secretion. T(1)AM might play an important physiological or pathophysiological role, and this signaling system might allow the development of new therapeutical agents."

Mitochondrial cristae morphology is highly variable and altered under numerous pathological conditions. The protein complexes involved are largely unknown or only insufficiently characterized. Using complexome profiling we identified apolipoprotein O (APOO) and apolipoprotein O-like protein (APOOL) as putative components of the Mitofilin/MINOS protein complex which was recently implicated in determining cristae morphology. We show that APOOL is a mitochondrial membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. It specifically binds to cardiolipin in vitro but not to the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol. Overexpression of APOOL led to fragmentation of mitochondria, a reduced basal oxygen consumption rate, and altered cristae morphology. Downregulation of APOOL impaired mitochondrial respiration and caused major alterations in cristae morphology. We further show that APOOL physically interacts with several subunits of the MINOS complex, namely Mitofilin, MINOS1, and SAMM50. We conclude that APOOL is a cardiolipin-binding component of the Mitofilin/MINOS protein complex determining cristae morphology in mammalian mitochondria. Our findings further assign an intracellular role to a member of the apolipoprotein family in mammals."

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-17-92 contributes to the activated phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). METHODS: RASFs were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and the expression and regulation of the miR-17-92 cluster were studied using real-time quantitative PCR (PCR) and promoter activity assays. RASFs were transfected with single precursor molecules of miRNAs from miR-17-92 and the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytokines was measured by quantitative PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Potential miRNA targets were identified by computational prediction and were validated using reporter gene assays and Western blotting. The activity of NF-\u03baB signaling was determined by reporter gene assays. RESULTS: We found that TNF\u03b1 induces the expression of miR-17-92 in RASFs in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Transfection of RASFs with precursor molecules of single members of miR-17-92 revealed significantly increased expression levels of matrix-degrading enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in precursor miR-18a (pre-miR-18a)-transfected RASFs. Using reporter gene assays, we identified the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor TNF\u03b1-induced protein 3 as a new target of miR-18a. In addition, pre-miR-18a-transfected RASFs showed stronger activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, both constitutively and in response to TNF\u03b1 stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the miR-17-92-derived miR-18a contributes to cartilage destruction and chronic inflammation in the joint through a positive feedback loop in NF-\u03baB signaling, with concomitant up-regulation of matrix-degrading enzymes and mediators of inflammation in RASFs."

PURPOSE: To evaluate the duration and dose intensity of epirubicin-based regimens in premenopausal patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). All patients in the three arms received chest wall irradiation at the end of the third cycle. RESULTS: After a 131-month median follow-up, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.4%, 42.5%, and 43.6% (P =.05) in the three arms, respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was superior both to 3 FEC 50 (P =.02) and to 3 FEC 75 (P =.05). The 10-year overall survival (OS) for the 6 FEC 50 arm was 64.3%, for the 3 FEC 50 arm it was 56.6%, and for the 3 FEC 75 arm, it was 59.7% (P =.25), respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was more effective than 3 FEC 50 (P =.10). Cox regression analysis demonstrates that OS was significantly better in the 6 FEC 50 than in the 3 FEC 50 arm (P =.046). No severe infections (grade 3 to 4), acute cardiac toxicity, or deaths from toxicity have been observed. Only five patients developed delayed cardiac dysfunctions, and three patients developed acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: After a long-term follow-up in an adjuvant setting, the benefit of six cycles of FEC 50 compared with three cycles, whatever the dose, is highly significant in terms of DFS. As regards OS, the group receiving six cycles of FEC 50 has significantly better results than the group receiving three cycles of FEC 50."

The purification of an ATR complex allowed identification of chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) as an ATR-associated protein by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. CHD4 (also called Mi-2beta) is a component of a histone-deacetylase-2 (HDAC2)-containing complex, the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NRD) complex. Endogenous ATR, CHD4, and HDAC2 are shown to coimmunoprecipitate, and ATR and HDAC2 coelute through two biochemical purification steps. Other members of the NRD complex, HDAC1, MTA1, and MTA2, are also detectable in ATR immunoprecipitates. ATR's association with CHD4 and HDAC2 suggests that there may be a linkage between ATR's role in mediating checkpoints induced by DNA damage and chromatin modulation via remodeling and deacetylation."

Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. It is caused by mutations in the PDS gene. Most published mutation studies of Pendred syndrome have dealt with Western populations. In this study, we examined clinical and molecular characteristics of 16 affected individuals in 6 unrelated Thai families. Of all the affected, 100% (16/16) had bilateral deafness, 68.8% (11/16) goiters, and 25% (4/16) hypothyroidism. Follicular thyroid carcinoma and H\u00fcrthle cell adenoma were found in affected members of a family, raising the possibility of an increased risk of thyroid carcinoma in Pendred syndrome patients. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the PDS gene successfully identified all 12 mutant alleles in these 6 families. The 12 identified mutant alleles constituted 6 distinct mutations including 3 splice site mutations (IVS4-1G>A, IVS7-2A>G, IVS9- 1G>A), one frame shift mutation (1548insC) and 2 missense mutations (T67S, H723R). Eight mutations out of 12 were constituted by IVS7- 2A>G and 1548insC, each one being present in 4 distinct alleles in our studied group. The identification of these two frequent PDS mutations will facilitate the molecular diagnosis of Pendred syndrome in Thai populations. In addition, three newly identified mutations, T67S, IVS4-1G>A, and IVS9-1G>A, were not observed in 50 unrelated healthy Thai controls."

These have been completed in conjunction with internal and external stakeholders, including a Provincial Expert Panel on Pharmacogenomics (PEPP). Within the PEPP, subgroup committees were developed for each disease area. For each technology, an economic analysis was also completed by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA) and is summarized within the reports.THE FOLLOWING REPORTS CAN BE PUBLICLY ACCESSED AT THE MAS WEBSITE AT: www.health.gov.on.ca/mas or at www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.htmlGENE EXPRESSION PROFILING FOR GUIDING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY DECISIONS IN WOMEN WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER: An Evidence-Based and Economic AnalysisEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation (EGFR) Testing for Prediction of Response to EGFR-Targeting Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Drugs in Patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Ecopnomic AnalysisK-RAS testing in Treatment Decisions for Advanced Colorectal Cancer: an Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis OBJECTIVE: To review and synthesize the available evidence regarding the laboratory performance, prognostic value, and predictive value of Oncotype-DX for the target population. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION The target population of this review is women with newly diagnosed early stage (stage I-IIIa) invasive breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone-receptor (PR) positive. Much of this review, however, is relevant for women with early stage (I and II) invasive breast cancer that is specifically ER positive, lymph node (LN) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) negative. This refined population represents an estimated incident population of 3,315 new breast cancers in Ontario (according to 2007 data). Currently it is estimated that only 15% of these women will develop a distant metastasis at 10 years; however, a far great proportion currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit. There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR) expression. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated with the risk of distant recurrence or death due to any cause in women with early breast cancer receiving tamoxifen?What is the predictive value of Oncotype-DX?Does Oncoytpe-DX recurrence score predict significant benefit in terms of improvements in 10-year distant recurrence or death due to any cause for women receiving tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to women receiving tamoxifen alone?How does Oncotype-DX compare to other known predictors of risk such as Adjuvant! Online?How does Oncotype-DX impact patient quality of life and clinical/patient decision-making? SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature search was performed on March 19(th), 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st), 2006 to March 19(th), 2010. A starting search date of January 1(st), 2006 was because a comprehensive systematic review of Oncotype-DX was identified in preliminary literature searching. This systematic review, by Marchionni et al. (2008), included literature up to January 1(st), 2007. All studies identified in the review by Marchionni et al. as well as those identified in updated literature searching were used to form the evidentiary base of this review. The quality of the overall body of evidence was identified as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any observational trial, controlled clinical trial, randomized controlled trial (RCT), meta-analysis or systematic review that reported on the laboratory performance, prognostic value and/or predictive value of Oncotype-DX testing, or other outcome relevant to the Key Questions, specific to the target population was included. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that did not report original data or original data analysis,Studies published in a language other than English,Studies reported only in abstract or as poster presentations (such publications were not sought nor included in this review since the MAS does not generally consider evidence that is not subject to peer review nor does the MAS consider evidence that lacks detailed description of methodology). OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Outcomes of interest varied depending on the Key Question. For the Key Questions of prognostic and predictive value (Key Questions #2 and #3), the prospectively defined primary outcome was risk of 10-year distant recurrence. The prospectively defined secondary outcome was 10-year death due to any cause (i.e., overall survival). All additional outcomes such as risk of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS) were not prospectively determined for this review but were reported as presented in included trials; these outcomes are referenced as tertiary outcomes in this review. Outcomes for other Key Questions (i.e., Key Questions #1, #4 and #5) were not prospectively defined due to the variability in endpoints relevant for these questions. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: A total of 26 studies were included. Of these 26 studies, only five studies were relevant to the primary questions of this review (Key Questions #2 and #3). The following conclusions were drawn from the entire body of evidence: There is a lack of external validation to support the reliability of Oncotype-DX; however, the current available evidence derived from internal industry validation studies suggests that Oncotype-DX is reliable (i.e., Oncotype-DX is repeatable and reproducible).Current available evidence suggests a moderate failure rate of Oncotype-DX testing; however, the failure rate observed across clinical trials included in this review is likely inflated; the current Ontario experience suggests an acceptably lower rate of test failure.In women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer (stage I-II) that is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node negative:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole (the latter for postmenopausal women only),There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX can predict which women will benefit from adjuvant CMF/MF chemotherapy in women being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.In postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node positive:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole,There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited predictive value for predicting which women will benefit from adjuvant CAF chemotherapy in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.There are methodological and statistical limitations that affect both the generalizability of the current available evidence, as well as the magnitude and statistical strength of the observed effect sizes; in particular:Of the major predictive trials, Oncotype-DX scores were only produced for a small subset of women (<40% of the original randomized population) potentially disabling the effects of treatment randomization and opening the possibility of selection bias;Data is not specific to HER-2/neu-negative women;There were limitations with multivariate statistical analyses.Additional trials of observational design may provide further validation of the prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype-DX; however, it is unlikely that prospective or randomized data will become available in the near future due to ethical, time and resource considerations.There is currently insufficient evidence investigating how Oncoytpe-DX compares to other known prognostic estimators of risk, such as Adjuvant! Online, and there is insufficient evidence investigating how Oncotype-DX would impact clinician/patient decision-making in a setting generalizable to Ontario."

BACKGROUND: Modifications to the age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, duration of symptoms, and diabetes (ABCD2) score, which incorporate history of hypertension and acute hyperglycemia in addition to acute blood pressure (BP) elevation and history of diabetes, have been proposed to increase the predictive value of the score. In addition, the timing of acute BP measurement may be important in the emergency department (ED) setting, given the phenomenon of \"ED triage hypertension\". METHODS: The standard ABCD2 score was compared to modified scores incorporating various combinations of acute BP elevation or hyperglycemia, history of hypertension or diabetes, and subsequent versus initial ED BP measurements. The number of patients reclassified into an alternate risk category (low/moderate/high) with different schemes was determined. Predictive value using the composite outcome of stroke, death, or high-risk transient ischemic attack mechanism was assessed using c statistics. RESULTS: Modified ABCD2 scores resulted in few patients shifting risk categories (between 2% and 10% for six alternate schemes), and did not improve the performance of the ABCD2 score (c-statistics, 0.61-0.65, compared to 0.63 for the standard score). ED triage hypertension was frequent (mean systolic blood pressure [SBP]/diastolic blood pressure [DBP] decrease of 8/9 mm Hg on subsequent measurement; P < .001), but the use of second BP did not reclassify many patients (10%) nor did it improve score performance (c-statistic, 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of the ABCD2 score changed the risk category for few patients and did not improve the overall predictive value of the score."

This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands. The precision of the predictions was found to be 80% with a recall of 88% when tested on the proteins with SwissProt annotated subcellular localization in Escherichia coli K 12 (788 sequences) and Salmonella typhimurium (366 sequences). When tested on the predicted proteome of E.coli, BOMP found 103 of a total of 4346 polypeptide sequences to be possible integral beta-barrel proteins. Of these, 36 were found by BLAST to lack similarity (E-value score < 1e-10) to proteins with annotated subcellular localization in SwissProt. BOMP predicted the content of integral beta-barrels per predicted proteome of 10 different bacteria to range from 1.8 to 3%. BOMP is available at http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/bomp."

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a common congenital malformation leading to bowel obstruction, with an incidence of 1/5,000 live births. It is characterized by the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. As enteric neurons are derived from the vagal neural crest, HSCR is regarded as a neurocristopathy. On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder. Accordingly, segregation analysis suggested an incompletely penetrant dominant inheritance in HSCR families with aganglionosis extending beyond the sigmoid colon. We and others have mapped a dominant gene for HSCR to chromosome 10q11.2 and have ascribed the disease to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. However, the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, the low penetrance and the sex-dependent effect of RET mutations supported the existence of one or more modifier gene(s) in familial HSCR. In addition, thus far, RET mutations only accounted for 50% and 15-20% of familial and sporadic HSCR patients, respectively. RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand was unknown. Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET. Moreover, Gdnf-/- knockout mutant mice display congenital intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis, a phenotype very similar to the Ret-/- mouse. These data prompted us to hypothesize that mutations of the gene encoding GDNF could either cause or modulate the HSCR phenotype in some cases."

Steven Pfeiffer syndrome pedigrees (three 3 generation and four 2 generation) have been recorded to date in addition to at least a dozen sporadic cases. Autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance is characteristic of the 7 familial instances. Variable expressivity has involved mostly the presence or absence of syndactyly and the degree of syndactyly when present. Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic. Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important. Type 1 is commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be found dominantly inherited in some families. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence. Recognition of type 3 is particularly important because extreme ocular proptosis in the absence of cloverleaf skull but with various visceral anomalies can result in failure to diagnose Pfeiffer syndrome and labeling the patient as an \"unknown\" or as a \"newly recognized entity.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

GATA-1 is essential for the generation of the erythroid, megakaryocytic, eosinophilic and mast cell lineages. It acts as an activator and repressor of different target genes, for example, in erythroid cells it represses cell proliferation and early hematopoietic genes while activating erythroid genes, yet it is not clear how both of these functions are mediated. Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. We also show that subsets of GATA-1 gene targets are bound in vivo by distinct complexes, thus linking specific GATA-1 partners to distinct aspects of its functions. Based on these findings, we suggest a model for the different roles of GATA-1 in erythroid differentiation."

The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (\u03b1)-granules in platelets. The genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. We studied 11 consecutive families with inherited macrothrombocytopenia of unknown origin and \u03b1-granule deficiency. All of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the \u03b1-granule content by immunofluorescence analysis for \u03b1-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9 novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations, as well as nucleotide substitutions that altered the splicing mechanisms as determined at the RNA level. All the individuals with NBEAL2 biallelic mutations showed almost complete absence of platelet \u03b1-granules. Interestingly, the 13 individuals assumed to be asymptomatic because carriers of a mutated allele had platelet macrocytosis and significant reduction of the \u03b1-granule content. However, they were not thrombocytopenic. In the remaining 7 probands, we did not identify any NBEAL2 alterations, suggesting that other genetic defect(s) are responsible for their platelet phenotype. Of note, these patients were characterized by a lower severity of the \u03b1-granule deficiency than individuals with two NBEAL2 mutated alleles. Our data extend the spectrum of mutations responsible for gray platelet syndrome and demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia with \u03b1-granule deficiency is a genetic heterogeneous trait. In terms of practical applications, the screening of NBEAL2 is worthwhile only in patients with macrothrombocytopenia and severe reduction of the \u03b1-granules. Finally, individuals carrying one NBEAL2 mutated allele have mild laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that even haploinsufficiency has an effect on platelet phenotype."

          "context": "Comparative tolerability of the newer generation antiparkinsonian agents. In recent years, the treatment of Parkinson's disease has undergone an immense amount of research, resulting in the development of multiple new medications. This has largely been fuelled by dissatisfaction over the development of motor complications secondary to long term levodopa therapy. Different treatment approaches are applied depending on the stage of Parkinson's disease. In early and mild Parkinson's disease, selegiline offers a limited symptomatic effect. Its neuroprotective effect, although at present theoretical, has questionable clinical relevance. Increased mortality associated with selegiline has been reported, although a meta-analysis of 5 different trials did not support this finding. The newer, non-ergoline dopamine agonists, pramipexole and ropinirole, have undergone extensive studies to evaluate their efficacy as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease. These newer agonists are ideal initial symptomatic medications, primarily because they delay the onset of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations. Efficacy of the newer dopamine agonists in advanced disease seems to be comparable to that of the older agents, bromocriptine and pergolide. Adverse effects can be reduced by starting the medication at a very low dose and then slowly titrating upward. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of motor fluctuations in advanced disease, particularly the 'wearing-off' phenomenon. Tolcapone, a peripheral and central COMT inhibitor, appears to be quite effective, producing a 47% reduction in 'off' time. Unfortunately, 3 deaths have been observed, which are presumably secondary to tolcapone therapy. The drug has been withdrawn in many countries, and liver enzyme testing is mandatory in the US. Entacapone, a purely peripheral COMT inhibitor with a lower potency than tolcapone, has also proved to be effective and has not been associated with liver damage, obviating the need for testing."

BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical resection is the standard treatment for subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex. An alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: Patients 3 years of age or older with serial growth of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas were eligible for this open-label study. The primary efficacy end point was the change in volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas between baseline and 6 months. We gave everolimus orally, at a dose of 3.0 mg per square meter of body-surface area, to achieve a trough concentration of 5 to 15 ng per milliliter. RESULTS: We enrolled 28 patients. Everolimus therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs. 6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least 50% in 9 patients (32%). Marked reductions were seen within 3 months and were sustained. There were no new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other therapy for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Of the 16 patients for whom 24-hour video electroencephalography data were available, seizure frequency for the 6-month study period (vs. the previous 6-month period) decreased in 9, did not change in 6, and increased in 1 (median change, -1 seizure; P=0.02). The mean (\u00b1SD) score on the validated Quality-of-Life in Childhood Epilepsy questionnaire (on which scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) was improved at 3 months (63.4\u00b112.4) and 6 months (62.1\u00b114.2) over the baseline score (57.8\u00b114.0). Single cases of grade 3 treatment-related sinusitis, pneumonia, viral bronchitis, tooth infection, stomatitis, and leukopenia were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus therapy was associated with marked reduction in the volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas and seizure frequency and may be a potential alternative to neurosurgical resection in some cases, though long-term studies are needed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among the 396 patients included on the trial, histologic material was available for a total of 249 patients at diagnosis (n = 189 patients) and/or at relapse (n = 147 patients), which included 87 matched pairs. The patient data were analyzed by immunochemistry for CD10, BCL6, MUM1, FOXP1, and BCL2 expression and by fluorescent in situ hybridization for BCL2, BCL6 and c-MYC breakpoints. The correlation with survival data was performed by using the log-rank test and the Cox model. RESULTS: Characteristics of immunophenotype and chromosomal abnormalities were statistically highly concordant in the matched biopsies. In univariate analysis, the presence of c-MYC gene rearrangement was the only parameter to be significantly correlated with a worse progression-free survival (PFS; P = .02) and a worse overall survival (P = .04). When treatment interaction was tested, the germinal center B (GCB) -like DLBCL that was based on the algorithm by Hans was significantly associated with a better PFS in the R-DHAP arm. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic relevance was found for the GCB/non-GCB the Hans phenotype interaction treatment (P = .04), prior rituximab exposure (P = .0052), secondary age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (P = .039), and FoxP1 expression (P = .047).

CONCLUSION: COO remains a major and independent factor in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, with a better response to R-DHAP in GCB-like DLBCL. This needs confirmation by a prospective study."

OBJECTIVE: To carry out genetic analysis for a fetus with Dandy-Walker malformation and provide prenatal diagnosis for its parents during the subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: Routine G-banding was carried out to analyze the karyotype of the fetus and its parents, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to verify the result. RESULTS: The father showed a normal karyotype, while the mother was found to carry a balanced t(11; 22) (q23; q11) translocation. NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11). The fetus was diagnosed with Emanuel syndrome. During the next pregnancy, the fetus was found to carry the same balanced translocation as its mother. After genetic counseling, the couple decided to continue with the pregnancy, and eventually delivered a healthy baby. CONCLUSION: A fetal case of Emanuel syndrome has been identified. The derivative der(22) t(11; 22)(q23; q11) chromosome probably underlies the Dandy-Walker malformation in the fetus. Combined cytogenetic and molecular analyses can attain a more precise diagnosis for fetal abnormalities detected by ultrasonography."

BACKGROUND: The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a common and clinically heterogeneous leukemia occurring in adults, remains poorly understood. METHODS: We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease. RESULTS: Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

NOACs are classified into two groups: direct thrombin inhibitor (notably dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (including rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban).

          "context": "HMGA1 reprograms somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells by inducing stem cell transcriptional networks. BACKGROUND: Although recent studies have identified genes expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that induce pluripotency, the molecular underpinnings of normal stem cell function remain poorly understood. The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene is highly expressed in hESCs and poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers; however, its role in these settings has been unclear. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that HMGA1 is highly expressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs and hESCs, with intermediate levels in ECCs and low levels in fibroblasts. When hESCs are induced to differentiate, HMGA1 decreases and parallels that of other pluripotency factors. Conversely, forced expression of HMGA1 blocks differentiation of hESCs. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM). HMGA1 increases the number and size of iPSC colonies compared to OSKM controls. Surprisingly, there was normal differentiation in vitro and benign teratoma formation in vivo of the HMGA1-derived iPSCs. During the reprogramming process, HMGA1 induces the expression of pluripotency genes, including SOX2, LIN28, and cMYC, while knockdown of HMGA1 in hESCs results in the repression of these genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that HMGA1 binds to the promoters of these pluripotency genes in vivo. In addition, interfering with HMGA1 function using a short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative construct blocks cellular reprogramming to a pluripotent state. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming from a somatic cell to a fully pluripotent stem cell. These findings identify a novel role for HMGA1 as a key regulator of the stem cell state by inducing transcriptional networks that drive pluripotency. Although further studies are needed, these HMGA1 pathways could be exploited in regenerative medicine or as novel therapeutic targets for poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers."

We have described the application of a simple biotinylation tagging approach for the direct purification of tagged transcription factor complexes, based on the use of artificial short peptide tags that are specifically and efficiently biotinylated by the bacterial BirA biotin ligase, which is co-expressed in cells with the tagged factor. We used this approach to initially characterize complexes formed by the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 in erythroid cells. GATA-1 is essential for the erythroid differentiation, its functions encompassing upregulation of erythroid genes, repression of alternative transcription programs, and suppression of cell proliferation. However, it was not clear how all of these GATA-1 functions are mediated. Our work describes, for the first time, distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We next applied the biotinylation tag to Ldb-1, a known partner of GATA-1, and characterized a number of novel interaction partners that are essential in erythroid development, in particular, Eto-2, Lmo4, and CdK9. Last, we are in the process of applying the same technology to characterize the factors that are bound to the suppressed gamma-globin promoter in vivo."

H-ras, N-ras, and K-ras are canonical ras gene family members frequently activated by point mutation in human cancers and coding for 4 different, highly related protein isoforms (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B). Their expression is nearly ubiquitous and broadly conserved across eukaryotic species, although there are quantitative and qualitative differences of expression depending on the tissue and/or developmental stage under consideration. Extensive functional studies have determined during the last quarter century that these Ras gene products are critical components of signaling pathways that control eukaryotic cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, because of their homology and frequent coexpression in various cellular contexts, it remained unclear whether the different Ras proteins play specific or overlapping functional roles in physiological and pathological processes. Initially, their high degree of sequence homology and the observation that all Ras isoforms share common sets of downstream effectors and upstream activators suggested that they were mostly redundant functionally. In contrast, the notion of functional specificity for each of the different Ras isoforms is supported at present by an increasing body of experimental observations, including 1) the fact that different ras isoforms are preferentially mutated in specific types of tumors or developmental disorders; 2) the different transforming potential of transfected ras genes in different cell contexts; 3) the distinct sensitivities exhibited by the various Ras family members for modulation by different GAPs or GEFs; 4) the demonstration that different Ras isoforms follow distinct intracellular processing pathways and localize to different membrane microdomains or subcellular compartments; 5) the different phenotypes displayed by genetically modified animal strains for each of the 3 ras loci; and 6) the specific transcriptional networks controlled by each isoform in different cellular settings."

Combination of experimental results from different proteases (LysC and trypsin) enabled a significant increase in the number of identified protein and protein can be quantified.

While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family."

The chromatin organizer modifier domain (chromodomain) is present in proteins that contribute to chromatin organization and mediates their binding to methylated histone H3. Despite a high level of sequence conservation, individual chromodomains manifest substantial differences in binding preference for methylated forms of histone H3, suggesting that posttranslational modification of the chromodomain might be an important determinant of binding specificity. We now show that mouse Cbx2 (also known as M33), a homolog of Drosophila Polycomb protein, is highly phosphorylated in some cell lines. A low-mobility band of Cbx2 observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was thus converted to a higher-mobility band by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine-42, a conserved amino acid in the chromodomain, as a phosphorylation site of Cbx2. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory."

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective review of the detailed neurological and neuroradiological features of nine children (four females, five males; age range at last examination 6-20y) with genetically proven EAST syndrome. RESULTS: All children presented with tonic-clonic seizures in infancy. Later, non-progressive, cerebellar ataxia and hearing loss were noted. Whilst seizures mostly responded well to treatment, ataxia proved to be the most debilitating feature, with three patients non-ambulant. All available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed subtle symmetrical signal changes in the cerebellar dentate nuclei. Moreover, four patients had a small corpus callosum and brainstem hypoplasia, and three had a small spinal cord. Regional quantitative volumetric analysis of the images confirmed the corpus callosum and brainstem hypoplasia and showed further patterns of variation from the norm. INTERPRETATION: The neurological features of EAST syndrome appear to be non-progressive, which is important for prognostic counselling. The spectrum of EAST syndrome includes consistent abnormalities on brain MRI, which may aid diagnosis. Further longitudinal documentation is required to determine the true natural history of the disorder."

          "context": "Stroke prevention with rivaroxaban in higher-risk populations with atrial fibrillation. BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major risk factor for stroke. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. In the pivotal phase III trial ROCKET AF, rivaroxaban demonstrated non-inferiority compared with warfarin for reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF (intention-to-treat analysis), without an increased risk of major bleeding. Superior efficacy vs. warfarin was achieved while patients were on study medication. Other direct oral factor Xa inhibitors have completed phase III clinical trials in this indication. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF. Baseline stroke risk, as indicated by CHADS2 scores, was lower in patients in the ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE-AF trials than in ROCKET AF. OBJECTIVES: This review discusses the main findings from ROCKET AF, specifically examining recent subgroup analyses investigating rivaroxaban use across various patient types at high risk for adverse outcomes, including those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack, reduced renal function, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or patients aged > \u00a075\u00a0years and those resident in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: These subgroup analyses demonstrate that the treatment effect for rivaroxaban vs. warfarin is broadly consistent across a wide range of patient groups, with respect to both efficacy and safety."

BACKGROUND: Overgrowth conditions are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and various degrees of learning difficulties and intellectual disability. Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively. NSD1 and EZH2 are both histone-modifying enzymes. These two epigenetic writers catalyse two specific post-translational modifications of histones: methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) and lysine 27 (H3K27). We postulated that mutations in writers of these two chromatin marks could cause overgrowth conditions, resembling Sotos or Weaver syndromes, in patients with no NSD1 or EZH2 abnormalities. METHODS: We analysed the coding sequences of 14 H3K27 methylation-related genes and eight H3K36 methylation-related genes using a targeted next-generation sequencing approach in three Sotos, 11 'Sotos-like' and two Weaver syndrome patients. RESULTS: We identified two heterozygous mutations in the SETD2 gene in two patients with 'Sotos-like' syndrome: one missense p.Leu1815Trp de novo mutation in a boy and one nonsense p.Gln274* mutation in an adopted girl. SETD2 is non-redundantly responsible for H3K36 trimethylation. The two probands shared similar clinical features, including postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, obesity, speech delay and advanced carpal ossification. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the power of targeted next-generation sequencing to identify rare disease-causing variants. We provide a compelling argument for Sotos and Sotos-like syndromes as epigenetic diseases caused by loss-of-function mutations of epigenetic writers of the H3K36 histone mark."

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the archetypal member of the alphaherpesvirus with a large genome encoding over 80 viral proteins, many of which are involved in virus-host interactions and show immune modulatory capabilities. In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 UL42 protein, a DNA polymerase processivity factor, was a novel antagonism of the canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. UL42 was shown to significantly suppress TNF-\u03b1 mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that UL42 bound to the NF-\u03baB subunits p65 and p50. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that UL42 abolished nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 upon TNF-\u03b1-stimulation. But the inhibiting capacity of UL42 2R/2A (R279A, R280A) and UL42 3R/3A (R113A, R279A and R280A) mutants were less than wild type UL42. Also UL42 bound to the Rel homology domain of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 and p50. Notably, the N-terminal of UL42 was sufficient to interact with p65 and p50 and abolished NF-\u03baB reporter gene activity. Thus, it was first time we demonstrated that HSV-1 UL42 appeared to prevent NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expression by retaining p65 and p50 in the cytoplasm, and UL42-dependent transcriptional activation were inherently coupled to promote HSV-1 lytic replication, which also may contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis of HSV-1."

Here we report that TNF-\u03b1 promotes human RPE cell migration by inducing matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) expression. Inhibition of MMP-9 by its inhibitor or its neutralizing antibody inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced in vitro RPE cell migration. Reversely, exogenously-added active MMP-9 promoted RPE cell migration. Suppression Akt/mTOR complex 1(mTORC1) activation by LY 294002 and rapamycin inhibited TNF-\u03b1-mediated MMP-9 expression. To introduce a constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) in cultured RPE cells increased MMP-9 expression, and to block mTORC1 activation by rapamycin inhibited its effect. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of SIN1, a key component of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), had no effect on MMP-9 expression or secretion. In conclusion, this study suggest that TNF-\u03b1 promotes RPE cell migration by inducing MMP-9 expression through activation of Akt/ mTORC1, but not mTORC2 signaling."

Thyroid hormone (TH) responsive genes can be both positively and negatively regulated by TH through receptors (TR) alpha and beta expressed in most body tissues. However, their relative roles in the regulation of specific gene expression remain unknown. The TR beta knockout mouse, which lacks both TR beta1 and TR beta2 isoforms, provides a model to examine the role of these receptors in mediating TH action. TR beta deficient (TR beta-/-) mice that show no compensatory increase in TR alpha, and wild-type (TR beta+/+) mice of the same strain were deprived of TH by feeding them a low iodine diet containing propylthiouracil, and were then treated with supraphysiological doses of L-T3 (0.5, 5.5, and 25 microg/day/mouse). TH deprivation alone increased the serum cholesterol concentration by 25% in TR beta+/+ mice and reduced it paradoxically by 23% in TR beta-/- mice. TH deprivation reduced the serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) concentration by 31% in TR beta+/+ mice but showed no change in the TR beta-/- mice. Treatment with L-T3 (0.5 to 25 microg/mouse/day) caused a 57% decrease in serum cholesterol and a 231% increase in serum AP in the TR beta+/+ mice. The TR beta-/- mice were resistant to the L-T3 induced changes in serum cholesterol and showed increase in AP only with the highest L-T3 dose. Basal heart rate (HR) in TR beta-/- mice was higher than that of TR beta+/+ mice by 11%. HR and energy expenditure (EE) in both TR beta+/+ and TR beta-/- mice showed similar decreases (49 and 46%) and increases (49 and 41%) in response to TH deprivation and L-T3 treatment, respectively. The effect of TH on the accumulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) of TH regulated liver genes was also examined. TH deprivation down regulated spot 14 (S14) mRNA and showed no change in malic enzyme (ME) mRNA in both TR beta+/+ and TR beta-/- mice. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. Thus, as previously shown for serum TSH, TR beta is not absolutely necessary for some changes typical of hypothyroidism to occur. In contrast, except for HR and EE, the full manifestation of TH-mediated action required the presence of TR beta."

BACKGROUND: Predicting protein complexes from protein-protein interaction data is becoming a fundamental problem in computational biology. The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditions. On the other hand, large datasets of experimentally detected protein-protein interactions were determined using High-throughput experimental techniques. However, experimental data is usually liable to contain a large number of spurious interactions. Therefore, it is essential to validate these interactions before exploiting them to predict protein complexes. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes. Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methods. PEWCC was able to detect more matched complexes than any of the state-of-the-art methods with higher quality scores. CONCLUSIONS: The higher accuracy achieved by PEWCC in detecting protein complexes is a valid argument in favor of the proposed method.

Subsequently, anti-programmed cell death-1 (a-PD-1) antibodies (pembrolizuamb, nivolumab), inhibitors of PD-1/programmed cell death-1 ligand (PD1-L) synapse, showed higher clinical efficacy with lower toxicity comparing to ipilimumab. The highest clinical benefit in patients was observed when nivolumab and ipiliumumab were combined. However, the above strategy, due to very high toxicity, has limitations for use in all patients with advanced melanoma. Notwithstanding, patients treated with anti-PD1 beyond disease progression benefit from treatment continuation; further studies are warranted in this indication. Furthermore, patients responding to treatment with anti-PD1 will benefit from the therapy after its discontinuation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are clinically effective regardless of BRAF mutation. Currently there is no recommendation regarding which treatment option should be selected for the treatment of the population - immunotherapy or targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Randomised trials are ongoing comparing these two treatment strategies in patients with BRAF mutation. Encouraging results were observed in early phase trials in patients receiving the combination of immune and targeted therapy. Phase 3 studies are underway. Patients with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase present poor prognosis regardless of the systemic treatment used. novel treatment strategies should probably be developed for these patients."

Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that Mcidas and GemC1 are sufficient and necessary for cell fate commitment and differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated ependymal cells. Furthermore, we show that GemC1 and Mcidas operate in hierarchical order, upstream of Foxj1 and c-Myb transcription factors, which are known regulators of ependymal cell generation, and that Notch signaling inhibits GemC1 and Mcidas function.

The human APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases, such as APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), are potent inhibitors of Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 Vif (viral infectivity factor) binds A3 proteins and targets these proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. As such, the therapeutic blockage of Vif-A3 interaction is predicted to stimulate natural antiviral activity by rescuing APOBEC expression and virion packaging. In this study, we describe a successful application of the Protein Fragment Complementation Assay (PCA) based on the enzyme TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase to study Vif-A3 interactions. PCA is based on the interaction between two protein binding partners (e.g., Vif and A3G), which are fused to the two halves of a dissected marker protein (\u03b2-lactamase). Binding of the two partners reassembles \u03b2-lactamase and hence reconstitutes its activity. To validate our assay, we studied the effect of well-described Vif (DRMR, YRHHY) and A3G (D128K) mutations on the interaction between the two proteins. Additionally, we studied the interaction of human Vif with other members of the A3 family: A3F and APOBEC3C (A3C). Our results demonstrate the applicability of PCA as a simple and reliable technique for the assessment of Vif-A3 interactions. Furthermore, when compared with co-immunoprecipitation assays, PCA appeared to be a more sensitive technique for the quantitative assessment of Vif-A3 interactions. Thus, with our results, we conclude that PCA could be used to quantitatively study specific domains that may be involved in the interaction between Vif and APOBEC proteins."

The mutation was inherited from her mother who has isolated PNDM. The patient was successfully transferred from insulin to SU, whereas her mother showed SU resistance. Despite good glycemic control, no improvements in the cognitive performance were verified. We present our experience in switching treatment from insulin to oral SUs in this family, and also discuss whether or not the girl's developmental delay is related with the Kir6.2 mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first Portuguese patient reported with successful transition to SU treatment."

          "context": "Phenotypic variability in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta caused by BMP1 mutations. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is an inherited bone fragility disorder most commonly associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the type I collagen genes. Autosomal recessive mutations in a number of genes have also been described, including the BMP1 gene that encodes the mammalian Tolloid (mTLD) and its shorter isoform bone morphogenic protein-1 (BMP1). To date, less than 20 individuals with OI have been identified with BMP1 mutations, with skeletal phenotypes ranging from mild to severe and progressively deforming. In the majority of patients, bone fragility was associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD); however, the full range of phenotypes associated with BMP1 remains unclear. Here, we describe three children with mutations in BMP1 associated with a highly variable phenotype: a sibship homozygous for the c.2188delC mutation that affects only the shorter BMP1 isoform and a further patient who is compound heterozygous for a c.1293C>G nonsense mutation and a c.1148G>A missense mutation in the CUB1 domain. These individuals had recurrent fractures from early childhood, are hypermobile and have no evidence of dentinogenesis imperfecta. The homozygous siblings with OI had normal areal BMD by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry whereas the third patient presented with a high bone mass phenotype. Intravenous bisphosphonate therapy was started in all patients, but discontinued in two patients and reduced in another due to concerns about increasing bone stiffness leading to chalk-stick fractures. Given the association of BMP1-related OI with very high bone material density, concerns remain whether anti-resorptive therapy is indicated in this ultra-rare form of OI.\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is one of several dermatologic conditions in which nonspecific irritation may elicit the disease where it was not previously present. In this study we aimed to assess the cutaneous cellular immune reaction with intradermal antigen tests and the relation between Koebner's phenomenon and intradermal antigens. METHODS: Thirty psoriasis patients and 20 control subjects were tested with 0.1 mL intradermal injections of purified protein derivative (PPD), Candida (C), mumps (M), mixed respiratory vaccine (MRV), and saline control solutions. Koebner status was also determined in the psoriatic patients. Injection sites were evaluated at 72 h and on the eighth, 12th, 16th, and 20th days for erythema, induration, and local development of psoriasis. RESULTS: Two patients were Koebner positive and developed psoriasis at all five injection sites. However, local psoriasis development was observed at one or more injection sites in five Koebner-negative patients. In addition, intensity of delayed hypersensitivity reaction and resolution times demonstrate no significant difference between psoriatic and nonpsoriatic subjects statistically (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings may indicate that intradermal antigens used in this study were more effective in inducing the Koebner phenomenon than injury alone. Furthermore, we observed that there is no meaningful difference between psoriatic and nonpsoriatic subjects in developing cutaneous cellular immune reactions."

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial. We further evaluated the efficacy of tofacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

BACKGROUND: Telomerase complex genes mutations (DKC1, TERC, TERT, and NOP10) lead to premature telomere shortening and are responsible for different forms of dyskeratosis congenita. TERC and TERT mutations were also found in patients with aplastic anemia. The aim of this work is to analyze the possible involvement of the telomerase complex gene NOLA1, in a population of Italian AA patients. PROCEDURE: DNA of 108 AA patients and 170 normal controls was amplified by PCR and analyzed by DHPLC. For each abnormal elution profile PCR products was directly sequenced using ABI prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. RESULTS: We identified, in two patients and two control, the new c.390A > T variation, which is not reported in GenBank, and leads to p.H28L amino acidic change. Telomere analysis shows that the subjects carrying the change have a telomere length comparable to that of healthy controls thus suggesting that this variation has no effect on telomerase complex activity. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any clear disruptive mutation in NOLA1 gene. The non-conservative variation identified in our sample has no effect on telomeres length. This result suggests that heterozygous point mutations in NOLA1 gene are not responsible for AA in our patients at least acting via telomere. However, in our experience, molecular analysis of other telomerase complex gene (TERC, TERT) is important for AA patients and family members in order to set up an adequate therapeutic or surveillance program and identify carriers or exclude them as potential bone marrow donors."

A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B. Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on the DNA helix. Analyses of the in vitro assembled enhanceosome revealed that the transcriptional synergy is due, at least in part, to the cooperative assembly and stability of the complex. Reconstitution experiments showed that the formation of a stable enhanceosome-dependent preinitiation complex require cooperative interactions between the enhanceosome; the general transcription factors TFID, TFIIA, and TFIIB; and the cofactor USA. These studies provide a direct biochemical demonstration of the importance of the structure and function of natural multicomponent transcriptional enhancer complexes in gene regulation."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive values of Tokuhashi score, revised Tokuhashi score and Tomita score systems for life expectancy and treatment options in patients with spinal metastasis. METHODS: From February 1996 to January 2009, spinal operations in 104 cases with spinal metastasis were performed in our hospital. There were 65 males and 39 females, with an average of 53.4 years (median 52.5 years). To calculate AUC (area under the curve) values of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of three scores, and to analyze the accuracy of prediction of life expectancy. To compare the actual survival time with the expected survival time of the three scores by Kaplan-Meier method. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the survival time and three scoring systems. RESULTS: All cases were followed-up with an average duration of 10.9 months, and 77 patients died. AUC analysis of ROC curves showed that the difference of the accuracy of the three scores was not significant. AUC in all groups of Tokuhashi Score was low, with a poor diagnostic accuracy. In the \"died within 3 months\" and \"died within 6 months\" groups of revised Tokuhashi score, the accuracy was low, while high in the other two groups. The AUC values of Tomita score in \"died within 6 months\" and \"died within 24 months\" were high, with a great diagnostic accuracy while the other two groups were low with a low diagnostic accuracy. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the actual survival time in all three scores was not entirely consistent with the expected survival time. Tokuhashi score and revised score were positively correlated with the survival time while that of Tomita score was negative. CONCLUSION: All the three prognosis scores in patients with spinal metastasis were closely related with survival time. The combination of Tokuhashi score and Tomita score may be applied to better predict postoperative survival prognosis and guide the surgical options for patients with spinal metastasis."

The clinical significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been reported in a variety of human carcinomas including breast cancer. However, molecular signature of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their prognostic value in breast cancer patients remain elusive. We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors. We conducted retrospective studies in a diverse cohort of breast cancer patients with a 1-5\u00a0year tumor relapse versus those with up to 7\u00a0years relapse-free survival. The RNAs were extracted from the frozen tumor specimens at the time of diagnosis and subjected to microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Paraffin-embedded tissues were also subjected to immunohistochemistry staining. We determined that a network of immune function genes involved in B cell development, interferon signaling associated with allograft rejection and autoimmune reaction, antigen presentation pathway, and cross talk between adaptive and innate immune responses were exclusively upregulated in patients with relapse-free survival. Among the 299 genes, five genes which included B cell response genes were found to predict with >85% accuracy relapse-free survival. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes."

We examined the association of the age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score, a validated risk prediction model for stroke after TIA, and the presence of ICS or ECS. METHODS: Vascular imaging and ABCD2 scores were obtained in a retrospective cohort of 77 consecutive patients diagnosed with TIA in a single center emergency department. The association between vascular stenosis and ABCD2 scores and how each related to clinical outcome was examined. RESULTS: In all, 30 (39.2%) TIA patients had 37 stenotic lesions; 15 (40.5%) stenotic lesions were ICS and 22 (59.5%) stenotic lesions were ECS. A total of 7 patients (9.5%) had both ECS and ICS lesions. Patients with ABCD2 > 3 were more likely to have ICS (odds ratio [OR] = 6.25, confidence interval [CI] 1.39-32.44, P = .009) and ECS (OR = 5.25, CI = 1.56-17.66, P = .005). Of the 37 stenotic lesions, 21 (56.7%) were symptomatic; 4 (19.2%) of these had an ABCD2 < 3. At 7 days, there were 4 ischemic strokes, 3 had previously demonstrated symptomatic stenotic lesions, and all had ABCD2 scores > 3. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients in the low-risk ABCD2 scores, the patients with medium- to high-risk ABCD2 scores are more likely to have symptomatic and asymptomatic vascular stenotic lesions. However, 1 in 5 patients with low-risk ABCD2 score has symptomatic stenotic lesions, indicating ABCD2 score does not identify all patients with symptomatic stenotic lesions."

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Developmental delay (DD)/mental retardation also described as intellectual disability (ID), is seen in 1-3 per cent of general population. Diagnosis continues to be a challenge at clinical level. With the advancement of new molecular cytogenetic techniques such as cytogenetic microarray (CMA), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques, many microdeletion/microduplication syndromes with DD/ID are now delineated. MLPA technique can probe 40-50 genomic regions in a single reaction and is being used for evaluation of cases with DD/ID. In this study we evaluated the clinical utility of MLPA techniques with different probe sets to identify the aetiology of unexplained mental retardation in patients with ID/DD. METHODS: A total of 203 randomly selected DD/ID cases with/without malformations were studied. MLPA probe sets for subtelomeric regions (P070/P036) and common microdeletions/microduplications (P245-A2) and X-chromosome (P106) were used. Positive cases with MLPA technique were confirmed using either fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or follow up confirmatory MLPA probe sets. RESULTS: The overall detection rate was found to be 9.3 per cent (19 out of 203). The detection rates were 6.9 and 7.4 per cent for common microdeletion/microduplication and subtelomeric probe sets, respectively. No abnormality was detected with probe set for X-linked ID. The subtelomeric abnormalities detected included deletions of 1p36.33, 4p, 5p, 9p, 9q, 13q telomeric regions and duplication of 9pter. The deletions/duplications detected in non telomeric regions include regions for Prader Willi/Angelman regions, Williams syndrome, Smith Magenis syndrome and Velocardiofacial syndrome. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the use of P245-A2 and P070/P036-E1 probes gives good diagnostic yield. Though MLPA cannot probe the whole genome like cytogenetic microarray, due to its ease and relative low cost it is an important technique for evaluation of cases with DD/ID."

The gene responsible for NF1 is located on the chromosome region 17q11.2 and for familial moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25. This article reports on a 20-year-old female with neurofibromatosis-1 who developed moyamoya syndrome. More extensive reports and further investigations of such families having this combination will certainly provide a better understanding of this link in the near future."

With the increasing use of anti-tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (anti-TNF) biologic drugs to treat autoimmune diseases, an expanding array of adverse reactions is emerging. Anti-TNF drug-induced alopecia is a less well-known side effect of this class of drugs. The aim of this study was to define the clinical and histopathological features of alopecia arising in the setting of anti-TNF therapy. Clinical and histopathological features of 3 patients who developed scalp alopecia during anti-TNF treatment were examined. Two of the 3 patients also developed psoriasiform lesions outside the scalp, and biopsies from both scalp and nonscalp sites were reviewed. Clinically, each patient had large scaly patches associated with the scalp alopecia. All scalp biopsies revealed psoriasiform epidermal features and alopecia areata-like dermal changes. Epidermal changes included acanthosis and confluent parakeratosis with neutrophils and frank pustules. Dermal changes included markedly increased catagen/telogen and miniaturized hairs and peribulbar lymphocytic inflammation. Numerous plasma cells and eosinophils were present in all cases. Biopsies from the nonscalp lesions showed psoriasiform changes and prominent eosinophils and plasma cells. Two patients showed significant improvement of the alopecia with topical treatment only. In conclusion, anti-TNF therapy-related alopecia may closely mimic psoriatic alopecia and alopecia areata but can be histologically distinguished from alopecia areata by epidermal psoriasiform changes and dermal plasma cells and from primary psoriasis by the presence of plasma cells and eosinophils. A correct diagnosis can enable effective treatment and, in some cases, allow anti-TNF therapy to continue."

During the last two decades a large number of computational methods have been developed for predicting transmembrane protein topology. Current predictors rely on topogenic signals in the protein sequence, such as the distribution of positively charged residues in extra-membrane loops and the existence of N-terminal signals. However, phosphorylation and glycosylation are post-translational modifications (PTMs) that occur in a compartment-specific manner and therefore the presence of a phosphorylation or glycosylation site in a transmembrane protein provides topological information. We examine the combination of phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction with transmembrane protein topology prediction. We report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence. Our method integrates a novel feature in transmembrane protein topology prediction, which results in improved performance for topology prediction and reliable prediction of phosphorylation and glycosylation sites.

BACKGROUND: Proliferation markers and profiles have been recommended for guiding the choice of systemic treatments for breast cancer. However, the best molecular marker or test to use has not yet been identified. We did this study to identify factors that drive proliferation and its associated features in breast cancer and assess their association with clinical outcomes and response to chemotherapy. METHODS: We applied an artificial neural network-based integrative data mining approach to data from three cohorts of patients with breast cancer (the Nottingham discovery cohort (n=171), Uppsala cohort (n=249), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium [METABRIC] cohort; n=1980). We then identified the genes with the most effect on other genes in the resulting interactome map. Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) featured prominently in our interactome map of proliferation and we chose to take it forward in our analysis on the basis of its fundamental role in the function and dynamic regulation of mitotic spindles, mitotic progression, and chromosome segregation fidelity. We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), Nottingham early stage oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT; n=697), the Nottingham anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-NeoACT; n=200), the MD Anderson taxane plus anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (MD Anderson-NeoACT; n=508), and the multicentre phase 2 neoadjuvant clinical trial cohort (phase 2 NeoACT; NCT00455533; n=253). FINDINGS: In the METABRIC cohort, we detected SPAG5 gene gain or amplification at the Ch17q11.2 locus in 206 (10%) of 1980 patients overall, 46 (19%) of 237 patients with a PAM50-HER2 phenotype, and 87 (18%) of 488 patients with PAM50-LumB phenotype. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b750, 95% CI 1\u00b718-1\u00b792, p=0\u00b700010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b740-2\u00b701, p<0\u00b70001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b732-2\u00b712, p<0\u00b70001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020). In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b720-0\u00b760, p=0\u00b70010). Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7031). In multivariable analysis, both high SPAG5 transcript and high SPAG5 protein concentrations were independent predictors for a higher proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response after combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: OR 1\u00b771, 95% CI, 1\u00b707-2\u00b774, p=0\u00b7024; Nottingham-ACT: 8\u00b775, 2\u00b742-31\u00b762, p=0\u00b70010). INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription and play pivotal roles in various biological processes such as development, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. Identifying cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes is a crucial step in understanding gene regulatory networks. To this end, we have used a comparative genomics approach to identify putative cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes in vertebrates. DESCRIPTION: We have created a database named TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes & Associated COnserved Noncoding ElementS) (http://tfcones.fugu-sg.org) which contains all human, mouse and fugu TF-encoding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) associated with them. The CNEs were identified by gene-by-gene alignments of orthologous TF-encoding gene loci using MLAGAN. We also predicted putative transcription factor binding sites within the CNEs. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs contain experimentally defined binding sites for transcriptional activators and repressors, indicating that a majority of the CNEs may function as transcriptional regulatory elements. The TF-encoding genes that are involved in nervous system development are generally enriched for human-fugu CNEs. Users can retrieve TF-encoding genes and their associated CNEs by conducting a keyword search or by selecting a family of DNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: The conserved noncoding elements identified in TFCONES represent a catalog of highly prioritized putative cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes and are candidates for functional assay."

Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is a rare form of diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life. Heterozygous activation mutations in KCNJ11, encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, which acts as a key role in insulin secretion regulation, account for about half of the cases of PNDM. The majority of the patients represent isolated cases resulting from de novo mutations. Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome. Individuals with KCNJ11 mutations have been successfully transitioned from insulin to sulfonylurea (SU) therapy. Furthermore, there have been cases reported with variable improvement in neurological function following a successful switching. We describe a 12-year-old Portuguese girl with PNDM due to the previously reported R201C mutation in the KCNJ11 gene. Her medical history includes prematurity and moderate developmental delay. The mutation was inherited from her mother who has isolated PNDM. The patient was successfully transferred from insulin to SU, whereas her mother showed SU resistance. Despite good glycemic control, no improvements in the cognitive performance were verified. We present our experience in switching treatment from insulin to oral SUs in this family, and also discuss whether or not the girl's developmental delay is related with the Kir6.2 mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first Portuguese patient reported with successful transition to SU treatment."

Conjoined twinning, however, only arises when the twinning event occurs at about the primitive streak stage of development, at about 13-14 days after fertilisation in the human, and is exclusively associated with the monoamniotic monochorionic type of placentation. It is believed that the highest incidence of conjoined twinning is encountered in the human. While monozygotic twinning may be induced experimentally following exposure to a variety of agents, the mechanism of induction of spontaneous twinning in the human remains unknown. All agents that are capable of acting as a twinning stimulus are teratogenic, and probably act by interfering with the spindle apparatus. DISCUSSION: The incidence of the various types of conjoined twinning is discussed. Information from the largest study to date indicates that the spontaneous incidence is about 10.25 per million births. The most common varieties encountered were thoraco-omphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18.5%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%) and craniopagus (6%). Of these, about 40% were stillborn, and 60% liveborn, although only about 25% of those that survived to birth lived long enough to be candidates for surgery. Conjoined twinning occurs by the incomplete splitting of the embryonic axis and, with the exception of parasitic conjoined twins, all are symmetrical and \"the same parts are always united to the same parts\". Fusion of monozygotic twins is no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning. Accounts are provided of the anatomical features of each of the commonly encountered varieties."

Southern analysis of restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments from mouse/human hybrid cells containing only human chromosome 21 showed that the predominant higher-order repeating unit for pTRA-2 is a 3.9 kb structure. Analysis of a \"consensus\" in situ hybridisation profile derived from 13 normal individuals revealed the localisation of 73% of all centromeric autoradiographic grains over the five acrocentric chromosomes, with the following distribution: 20.4%, 21.5%, 17.1%, 7.3% and 6.5% on chromosomes 13, 14, 21, 15 and 22 respectively. An average of 1.4% of grains was found on the centromere of each of the remaining 19 nonacrocentric chromosomes. These results indicate the presence of a common subfamily of alpha satellite DNA on the five acrocentric chromosomes and suggest an evolutionary process consistent with recombination exchange of sequences between the nonhomologues. The results further suggests that such exchanges are more selective for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21 than for chromosomes 15 and 22. The possible role of centromeric alpha satellite DNA in the aetiology of 13q14q and 14q21q Robertsonian translocations involving the common and nonrandom association of chromosomes 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 is discussed."

          "context": "The exosome component Rrp6 is required for RNA polymerase II termination at specific targets of the Nrd1-Nab3 pathway. The exosome and its nuclear specific subunit Rrp6 form a 3'-5' exonuclease complex that regulates diverse aspects of RNA biology including 3' end processing and degradation of a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and unstable transcripts. Known targets of the nuclear exosome include short (<1000 bp) RNAPII transcripts such as small noncoding RNAs (snRNAs), cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), and some stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs) that are terminated by an Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS) dependent mechanism. NNS-dependent termination is coupled to RNA 3' end processing and/or degradation by the Rrp6/exosome in yeast. Recent work suggests Nrd1 is necessary for transcriptome surveillance, regulating promoter directionality and suppressing antisense transcription independently of, or prior to, Rrp6 activity. It remains unclear whether Rrp6 is directly involved in termination; however, Rrp6 has been implicated in the 3' end processing and degradation of ncRNA transcripts including CUTs. To determine the role of Rrp6 in NNS termination globally, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on total RNA and perform ChIP-exo analysis of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) localization. Deletion of RRP6 promotes hyper-elongation of multiple NNS-dependent transcripts resulting from both improperly processed 3' RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes. The defects in RNAPII termination cause transcriptome-wide changes in mRNA expression through transcription interference and/or antisense repression, similar to previously reported effects of depleting Nrd1 from the nucleus. Elongated transcripts were identified within all classes of known NNS targets with the largest changes in transcription termination occurring at CUTs. Interestingly, the extended transcripts that we have detected in our studies show remarkable similarity to Nrd1-unterminated transcripts at many locations, suggesting that Rrp6 acts with the NNS complex globally to promote transcription termination in addition to 3' end RNA processing and/or degradation at specific targets."

The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) and oral direct inhibitors of factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban) have emerged recently as an alternative to VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. These drugs act rapidly, and have a predictable and stable dose-related anticoagulant effect with a few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The novel oral anticoagulants are used in fixed doses with no need for regular laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation intensity. However, each of these drugs has distinct pharmacological properties that could influence optimal use in clinical practice. The following phase 3 randomized trials with novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for stroke prevention in AF have been completed: the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial with dabigatran, the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial with rivaroxaban, and the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolism Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial with apixaban. Moreover, the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to prevent Strokes (AVERROES) trial included patients with AF who have failed or were unsuitable for warfarin, and compared apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Overall, apixaban has two large trials for stroke prevention in AF showing benefits not only over warfarin, but also over aspirin among those patients who have failed or refused warfarin. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin in the reduction of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality, with a similar reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke and better tolerability. When compared with aspirin in the AVERROES trial, apixaban was associated with more effective reduction of stroke, a similar risk of major bleeding, and better tolerability. In this review article, the authors summarize the current knowledge on novel oral anticoagulants and discuss the clinical aspects of their use for stroke prevention in AF, with particular emphasis on apixaban."

Multidrug resistance among the 'ESKAPE' organisms - encompassing Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. - is of particular concern because they are responsible for many serious infections in hospitals. Although some promising agents are in the pipeline, there is an urgent need for new antibiotic scaffolds. However, antibacterial researchers have struggled to identify new small molecules with meaningful cellular activity, especially those effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. This difficulty ultimately stems from an incomplete understanding of efflux systems and compound permeation through bacterial membranes. This Opinion article describes findings from target-based and phenotypic screening efforts carried out at AstraZeneca over the past decade, discusses some of the subsequent chemistry challenges and concludes with a description of new approaches comprising a combination of computational modelling and advanced biological tools which may pave the way towards the discovery of new antibacterial agents."

Numerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer. Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy. In this study, 239 samples obtained from 215 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were tested for the presence of the seven most common mutations in the KRAS gene and the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Among the tested patients, 53.8% of patients had wt-KRAS genotype and 46.2% were KRAS mutants. Around five percent (5.1%) of the tested patients bore the V600E mutation in BRAF gene. All the patients showing to have the V600E mutation in BRAF were wt-KRAS. The concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status between primary and metastatic tumor tissue samples was 100%. We have shown that the proportions of mutated and non-mutated KRAS in Slovene patients, as well as the proportion of V600E mutations in BRAF is similar to genotyping results reported by other authors. The tested seven KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 were mutually exclusive with the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Summing up the results about the KRAS and the BRAF mutation carriers from our study, the portion of potentially non-responsive patients for the anti-EGFR treatment is 51.3%."

This study investigated the types of ocular signs and symptoms in patients with POEMS and any systemic factors that may be associated with development of such ocular findings. DESIGN: Case series from tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 33 patients with POEMS syndrome underwent at least 1 ophthalmologic examination and were included in the study. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual symptoms, visual acuity, presence of optic disc edema (ODE), and levels of systemic factors (including plasma vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], plasma interlukin-6 [IL-6], and raised intracranial pressure) and their relationship to ODE. RESULTS: Five of the patients (15%) reported diplopia, 15 patients (45%) had blurred vision, and 3 patients (9%) had ocular pain. The most common ocular finding was bilateral ODE in 17 patients (52%). Of the patients with ODE, 5 (29%) were asymptomatic at the first ocular examination. Among patients with ODE, there was a significant difference (P = 0.03) between the mean plasma VEGF level at the time of diagnosis of the ODE compared with when the ODE resolved. There was no difference in plasma IL-6 levels between people with and without ODE. Patients with ODE had a higher mean lumbar puncture opening pressure (276\u00b114 mm H(2)O; normal range, 100-250 mm H(2)0) than patients without ODE, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Optic disc edema is a common finding in patients with POEMS. Because patients can be asymptomatic, eye examinations should be performed in all patients with POEMS. There may be an association between elevated VEGF and intracranial pressure and ODE; further studies are required."

Their expression is nearly ubiquitous and broadly conserved across eukaryotic species, although there are quantitative and qualitative differences of expression depending on the tissue and/or developmental stage under consideration. Extensive functional studies have determined during the last quarter century that these Ras gene products are critical components of signaling pathways that control eukaryotic cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, because of their homology and frequent coexpression in various cellular contexts, it remained unclear whether the different Ras proteins play specific or overlapping functional roles in physiological and pathological processes. Initially, their high degree of sequence homology and the observation that all Ras isoforms share common sets of downstream effectors and upstream activators suggested that they were mostly redundant functionally. In contrast, the notion of functional specificity for each of the different Ras isoforms is supported at present by an increasing body of experimental observations, including 1) the fact that different ras isoforms are preferentially mutated in specific types of tumors or developmental disorders; 2) the different transforming potential of transfected ras genes in different cell contexts; 3) the distinct sensitivities exhibited by the various Ras family members for modulation by different GAPs or GEFs; 4) the demonstration that different Ras isoforms follow distinct intracellular processing pathways and localize to different membrane microdomains or subcellular compartments; 5) the different phenotypes displayed by genetically modified animal strains for each of the 3 ras loci; and 6) the specific transcriptional networks controlled by each isoform in different cellular settings."

Here we examine the clinical characteristics of those TSC patients who have no mutation identified (NMI). A retrospective review of our patient population that had comprehensive testing for mutations in TSC1/TSC2 identified 23/157 (15%) that were NMI. NMI patients had a lower incidence of brain findings on imaging studies, neurological features, and renal findings than those with TSC2 mutations. In contrast, NMI patients had a lower incidence of seizures than TSC patients with TSC1 mutations, but had a higher incidence of both renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. This distinct constellation of findings suggest that NMI patients may have a unique molecular pathogenesis, different from that seen in TSC patients with the usual mutations in TSC1 and TSC2. We suggest that the mechanisms of disease in these patients include both mosaicism for a TSC2 mutation, and unusual non-coding region mutations in TSC2."

To determine the prevalence of the disorder, we sent surveillance questionnaires to 735 core hospitals in Japan. The observed number of Emanuel syndrome cases was 36 and that of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 40. On the basis of the de novo t(11;22) translocation frequency in sperm from healthy men, we calculated the frequency of the translocations in the general population. Accordingly, the prevalence of Emanuel syndrome was estimated at 1 in 110,000. Based on this calculation, the estimated number of Emanuel syndrome cases in Japan is 1063 and of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 16,604, which are much higher than the numbers calculated from the questionnaire responses. It is possible that this discordance is partly attributable to a lack of disease identification.

About 80 sequences (16s ribosomal RNA gene) of bacterial DNA in samples of skin and muscle taken directly from the Tyrolean iceman (3350-3100 years B.C.) or recovered during the 1992 archaeological expedition at the Alpine site were analyzed to obtain clues to the natural mummification process that allowed the corpse of the Neolithic shepherd/hunter to be preserved for more than 5,000 years. The investigation was made more complex by the fact that the surface of the mummy had been swabbed with phenol soon after the discovery (September 19, 1991). Our results show that no trace of microbial DNA is left on the actual surface of the body, while the untreated skin still bears the remains of large numbers of bacteria belonging to the genera Sphingomonas, Afipia, Curtobacterium, Microbacterium, Agromyces, and others. Compared to the untreated skin, the iceman's muscle is also very rich in bacterial DNA. However, this DNA comes, with few exceptions, from the species Clostridium algidicarnis. The sharp difference in the bacterial DNA composition of skin and muscle suggests that the remains of the original cadaveric microflora of the latter have not disappeared during the iceman's taphonomic history. On the other hand, the massive presence of C. algidicarnis, a cold-adapted sporigenous, the DNA of which was previously (Ubaldi et al. [1998] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 107:285-295) found in the soft tissue of a naturally desiccated Andean mummy, indicates that the hypothesis that the iceman's corpse underwent rapid dehydration by the effect of a warm wind (f\u00f6hn) is no longer plausible. The results best fit with the hypothesis (Bereuter et al. [1997] Chem. Eur. J. 7:1032-1038) that the body was first covered by snow and ice, and then underwent thawing and, finally, desiccation."

Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized. Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2). DC is therefore principally a disease of defective telomere maintenance and patients usually have very short telomeres. The genetic advances have led to the unification of DC with several other disorders, including the severe multisystem disorders Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classic DC to aplastic anemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance-\"the telomereopathies.\" These advances have increased our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and highlighted the important role of telomerase and telomeres in human biology.

Scoring functions are a critically important component of computer-aided screening methods for the identification of lead compounds during early stages of drug discovery. Here, we present a new multigrid implementation of the footprint similarity (FPS) scoring function that was recently developed in our laboratory which has proven useful for identification of compounds which bind to a protein on a per-residue basis in a way that resembles a known reference. The grid-based FPS method is much faster than its Cartesian-space counterpart, which makes it computationally tractable for on-the-fly docking, virtual screening, or de novo design. In this work, we establish that: (i) relatively few grids can be used to accurately approximate Cartesian space footprint similarity, (ii) the method yields improved success over the standard DOCK energy function for pose identification across a large test set of experimental co-crystal structures, for crossdocking, and for database enrichment, and (iii) grid-based FPS scoring can be used to tailor construction of new molecules to have specific properties, as demonstrated in a series of test cases targeting the viral protein HIVgp41. The method is available in the program DOCK6."

Selection of macitentan was based on inhibitory potency on both ET receptors and optimization of physicochemical properties to achieve high affinity for lipophilic milieu. In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577. Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors). In rats with pulmonary hypertension, macitentan prevented both the increase of pulmonary pressure and the right ventricle hypertrophy, and it markedly improved survival. In diabetic rats, chronic administration of macitentan decreased blood pressure and proteinuria and prevented end-organ damage (renal vascular hypertrophy and structural injury). In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats. This profile makes macitentan a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation."

The exact mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown, limiting the identification of effective disease-modifying therapies. The two principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), peptide deposition (senile plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. During the last decade, most of the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry were directed against the production and accumulation of A\u03b2. The most innovative of the pharmacological approaches was the stimulation of A\u03b2 clearance from the brain of AD patients via the administration of A\u03b2 antigens (active vaccination) or anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (passive vaccination). Several active and passive anti-A\u03b2 vaccines are under clinical investigation. Unfortunately, the first active vaccine (AN1792, consisting of preaggregate A\u03b2 and an immune adjuvant, QS-21) was abandoned because it caused meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of treated patients. Anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (bapineuzumab and solanezumab) are now being developed. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E \u03b54 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the A\u03b2 peptide. Solanezumab, a humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody directed against the midregion of the A\u03b2 peptide, was shown to neutralize soluble A\u03b2 species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab, while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. Although some studies suggested that active immunization may be effective against tau in animal models of AD, very few studies regarding passive immunization against tau protein are currently available. The results of the large, ongoing Phase III trials with bapineuzumab and solanezumab will tell us if monoclonal anti-A\u03b2 antibodies may slow down the rate of deterioration of AD. Based on the new diagnostic criteria of AD and on recent major failures of anti-A\u03b2 drugs in mild-to-moderate AD patients, one could argue that clinical trials on potential disease-modifying drugs, including immunological approaches, should be performed in the early stages of AD."

With the exception of a FKBP10 mutation in the BS case, all changes are novel. Of note, insertion of an AluYb8 repetitive element was detected in exon 6 of SERPINF1.

BACKGROUND: Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a multisystem disorder arising from underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. Renal impairment and related pathological changes have been reported, but data on its prevalence, response to therapy and impact on survival are still lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 299 patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome in a tertiary-care university hospital from 2000 until 2014. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was used to define renal impairment and response, according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria. We examined the impact of renal impairment and response on patient survival. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (22.4%) had renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) at baseline. In a multivariate analysis, ascites was independently associated with renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 12.366, P < 0.001]. Renal impairment was reversible in 66.0% of patients receiving therapy and was associated with a shorter time interval between symptom onset and treatment (OR 0.059, P = 0.043) and a vascular endothelial growth factor remission (OR 15.958, P = 0.050) in a multivariate analysis. In terms of therapy, patients with a renal response more commonly received a novel agent-based regimen (P = 0.037), which also led to a shorter response time (P = 0.001). With a median follow-up of 27.4 months, inferior survival was observed in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), but not in those with moderate dysfunction (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), compared with patients without renal impairment. A renal response, if achieved, predicted improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: Renal impairment is a common complication of POEMS syndrome, but can be reversed with effective therapy in most cases."

PURPOSE: To evaluate the duration and dose intensity of epirubicin-based regimens in premenopausal patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). All patients in the three arms received chest wall irradiation at the end of the third cycle. RESULTS: After a 131-month median follow-up, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.4%, 42.5%, and 43.6% (P =.05) in the three arms, respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was superior both to 3 FEC 50 (P =.02) and to 3 FEC 75 (P =.05). The 10-year overall survival (OS) for the 6 FEC 50 arm was 64.3%, for the 3 FEC 50 arm it was 56.6%, and for the 3 FEC 75 arm, it was 59.7% (P =.25), respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was more effective than 3 FEC 50 (P =.10). Cox regression analysis demonstrates that OS was significantly better in the 6 FEC 50 than in the 3 FEC 50 arm (P =.046). No severe infections (grade 3 to 4), acute cardiac toxicity, or deaths from toxicity have been observed. Only five patients developed delayed cardiac dysfunctions, and three patients developed acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: After a long-term follow-up in an adjuvant setting, the benefit of six cycles of FEC 50 compared with three cycles, whatever the dose, is highly significant in terms of DFS. As regards OS, the group receiving six cycles of FEC 50 has significantly better results than the group receiving three cycles of FEC 50."

Carney's triad--gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma--is a syndrome that occurs primarily in young women. To date, 28 patients with at least two of these individually unusual or rare neoplasms have been described. This updated case report of one of the originally described patients with Carney's triad highlights several clinically important features of this unusual syndrome: (1) the multicentricity of both the paragangliomas and the epithelioid leiomyosarcomas, (2) the often indolent progression of metastatic leiomyosarcoma, (3) the potential for late recurrences, and (4) the importance of distinguishing intra-adrenal from periadrenal catecholamine-producing tumors (paragangliomas). Localization of paragangliomas is facilitated by two relatively new techniques--131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning (a scintigraphic technique with high specificity for catecholamine-producing tumors) and two-dimensional echocardiography (which can noninvasively localize and demonstrate the anatomic relationships of aorticopulmonary paragangliomas). In patients with this syndrome, new or recurrent tumors frequently manifest after unusually long asymptomatic intervals. We outline an approach for continued follow-up of patients with one or more of the three neoplasms that constitute the syndrome. Rigorous long-term screening of these patients should not only lead to early recognition and resection of recurrent or new tumors but also enhance our understanding of this intriguing syndrome."

Precise regulation of chromatin structure is essential for proper development of higher eukaryotes, and methylation of histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27) by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) component EZH2 has emerged as an important and conserved mechanism to ensure silencing of developmentally regulated genes. Recurrent mutations within the histone H3 genes H3F3A and HIST1H3B that convert K27 to methionine (H3K27M) and disrupt the global H3K27 methylation landscape and PRC2-dependent silencing, have recently been identified in pediatric high-grade gliomas including Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; Type IV glioma). These findings have generated renewed interest in the dynamics of histone genes and their expression, which have been difficult to study due to redundancy and high sequence homology within the H3 gene family. In this in silico study, we re-evaluated genomic organization of the human H3 gene family and expression of these genes in the human brain, utilizing public RNA-based sequence datasets for the human genome and brain development. We identified transcriptional activity from at least 17 protein-encoding H3 genes in the developing brain, comprising at least 14 canonical (H3.1)-like and 3 'replication-independent' (H3.3)-like forms, and encoding six distinct H3 isoforms. Transcripts for H3.3 genes including H3F3A show gradual decrease in abundance associated with developmental progression, whereas H3.1 transcripts including HIST1H3B tend to be strongly downregulated at an early prenatal stage and remain essentially silent thereafter. Twelve genes, including members of both H3.1 and H3.3 classes, contain a K27-AAG codon that is mutable to that for M (ATG), whereas the remaining contain the alternative, AAA codon for K at this position. H3F3A is the only H3.3-like gene containing the K27-AAG codon, whereas HIST1H3B is among ten H3.1-like genes containing this codon. This data indicates that, in the early developing human brain, HIST1H3B constitutes the largest proportion of H3.1 transcripts among H3.1 isoforms. We suggest that the apparent overrepresentation of K27M mutations in H3F3A relative to other H3 isoforms may result from its uniqueness among H3.3s for the K27-AAG codon and the functional relationship between H3.3 and PRC2, whereas overrepresentation of K27M mutations in HIST1H3B may be a product of strong relative expression of this gene in the early developing brain."

PURPOSE: The available clinical data on target-specific oral anticoagulant (TSOAC) reversal agents that are currently in development or have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewed. SUMMARY: The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration. Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within 10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well tolerated in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs."

In Escherichia coli, the MutHLS system is known to function in MMR, and homologues of MutS and MutL are widely conserved in almost all organisms. However, the MutH endonuclease has not been found in the majority of organisms.

To elucidate the function of MutS2, we overexpressed and purified T. thermophilus MutS2 (ttMutS2). ttMutS2 demonstrated the ability to bind double-stranded (ds) DNA, but, unlike ttMutS, ttMutS2 showed no specificity for mismatched duplexes. ttMutS2 ATPase activity was also detected and was stimulated by dsDNA. Our results also showed that ttMutS2 incises dsDNA. ttMutS2 incises not only oligo dsDNA but also plasmid DNA, suggesting that ttMutS2 possesses an endonuclease activity.

AIMS: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is caused by mutations in multiple genes. It is still unclear whether LVNC is the primary determinant of cardiomyopathy or rather a secondary phenomenon with intrinsic cardiomyocyte dysfunction being the actual cause of the disease. Here, we describe a family with LVNC due to a novel missense mutation, pE96K, in the cardiac troponin T gene (TNNT2). METHODS AND RESULTS: The novel mutation was identified in the index patient and all affected relatives, but not in 430 healthy control individuals. Mutations in known LVNC-associated genes were excluded. To investigate the pathophysiological implications of the mutation, we generated transgenic mice expressing human wild-type cTNT (hcTNT) or a human troponin T harbouring the pE96K mutation (mut cTNT). Animals were characterized by echocardiography, histology, and gene expression analysis. Mut cTNT mice displayed an impaired left ventricular function and induction of marker genes of heart failure. Remarkably, left ventricular non-compaction was not observed. CONCLUSION: Familial co-segregation and the cardiomyopathy phenotype of mut cTNT mice strongly support a causal relationship of the pE96K mutation and disease in our index patient. In addition, our data suggest that a non-compaction phenotype is not required for the development of cardiomyopathy in this specific TNNT2 mutation leading to LVNC."

The transcription elongation factor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) regulates RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) processivity by promoting, in concert with negative elongation factor (NELF), promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII. DSIF is also reportedly involved in transcriptional activation. However, the role of DSIF in transcriptional activation by DNA-binding activators is unclear. Here we show that DSIF acts cooperatively with a DNA-binding activator, Gal4-VP16, to promote transcriptional activation. In the absence of DSIF, Gal4-VP16-activated transcription resulted in frequent pausing of RNAPII during elongation in vitro. The presence of DSIF reduced pausing, thereby supporting Gal4-VP16-mediated activation. We found that DSIF exerts its positive effects within a short time-frame from initiation to elongation, and that NELF does not affect the positive regulatory function of DSIF. Knockdown of the gene encoding the large subunit of DSIF, human Spt5 (hSpt5), in HeLa cells reduced Gal4-VP16-mediated activation of a reporter gene, but had no effect on expression in the absence of activator. Together, these results provide evidence that higher-level transcription has a stronger requirement for DSIF, and that DSIF contributes to efficient transcriptional activation by preventing RNAPII pausing during transcription elongation."

In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user. In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed). We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode."

The purification of an ATR complex allowed identification of chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) as an ATR-associated protein by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. CHD4 (also called Mi-2beta) is a component of a histone-deacetylase-2 (HDAC2)-containing complex, the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NRD) complex. Endogenous ATR, CHD4, and HDAC2 are shown to coimmunoprecipitate, and ATR and HDAC2 coelute through two biochemical purification steps. Other members of the NRD complex, HDAC1, MTA1, and MTA2, are also detectable in ATR immunoprecipitates.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score). However, some patients have strokes despite a low predicted risk according to these scores. We designed the ABCDE+ score by adding the variables 'etiology' and ischaemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) -'DWI-positivity'- to the ABCD-score. We hypothesized that this refinement increases the predictability of recurrent ischaemic events. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study amongst all consecutive TIA patients in a university hospital emergency department. Area under the computed receiver-operating curves (AUCs) were used to compare the predictive values of the scores with regard to the outcome stroke or recurrent TIA within 90 days. RESULTS: Amongst 248 patients, 33 (13.3%, 95%-CI 9.3-18.2%) had a stroke (n = 13) or a recurrent TIA (n = 20). Patients with recurrent ischaemic events more often had large-artery atherosclerosis as the cause for TIA (46% vs. 14%, P < 0.001) and positive DWI (61% vs. 35%; P = 0.01) compared with patients without recurrent events. Patients with and those without events did not differ with regard to age, clinical symptoms, duration, blood pressure, risk factors, and stroke preventive treatment. The comparison of AUCs [95%CI] showed superiority of the ABCDE+ score (0.67[0.55-0.75]) compared to the ABCD(2) -score (0.48[0.37-0.58]; P = 0.04) and a trend toward superiority compared to the ABCD-score (0.50[0.40-0.61]; P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In TIA patients, the addition of the variables 'etiology' and 'DWI-positivity' to the ABCD-score seems to enhance the predictability of subsequent cerebral ischaemic events."

They are present in the form of specialized organs, such as the pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, and adrenal gland, or in the form of the diffuse neuroendocrine system in the respiratory and digestive tracts. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, yet they present certain unifying features. These include frequent hormonal overproduction that leads to specific symptoms and a typical immunohistochemical staining profile with chromogranin A and synaptophysin reactivity. Over the past decades, many neuroendocrine tumors have been described in the context of heritable tumor syndromes, and there exist several syndromes that are almost entirely composed of neuroendocrine tumors. Tumors occurring as part of these hereditary syndromes are characterized by specific genetic abnormalities that have helped our understanding of tumorigenesis, and they frequently appear at a young age. It is therefore important for the pediatric pathologist to be aware of specific histologic characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors in childhood and of their association with specific tumor syndromes. This may alert other clinicians to the possibility of multiple tumors in the patient or his family members. This review focuses on hereditary syndromes with neuroendocrine tumors, including multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Carney complex, pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome, and familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma. In addition, several individual neuroendocrine tumors are described, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, gastroenteropancreatic tumors, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma, emphasizing specific histopathologic characteristics."

However, to what degree primary malignant cells can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state has not been vigorously assessed. We established an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model by overexpressing the human mixed-lineage leukemia-AF9 (MLL-AF9) fusion gene in mouse hematopoietic cells that carry Yamanaka factors under the control of doxycycline (Dox). On addition of Dox to the culture, the transplantable leukemia cells were efficiently converted into iPS cells that could form teratomas and produce chimeras. Interestingly, most chimeric mice spontaneously developed the same type of AML. Moreover, both iPS reprogramming and leukemia reinitiation paths could descend from the same leukemia-initiating cell. RNA-seq analysis showed reversible global gene expression patterns between these interchangeable leukemia and iPS cells on activation or reactivation of MLL-AF9, suggesting a sufficient epigenetic force in driving the leukemogenic process. This study represents an important step for further defining the potential interplay between oncogenic molecules and reprogramming factors during MLL leukemogenesis. More importantly, our reprogramming approach may be expanded to characterize a range of hematopoietic malignancies in order to develop new strategies for clinical diagnosis and treatment."

Here, we employ a screen to identify partners of budding yeast Cdc48 that are important for disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG helicase at the end of chromosome replication. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin-binding Ufd1-Npl4 complex recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG.

Mutation of K29 abrogates in\u00a0vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction."

Initial results revealed that spontaneous beating activity was higher in TR alpha 1- and lower in TR beta 1-expressing cardiomyocytes. This was associated with accelerated depolarization velocity and abbreviated action potential duration in cells overexpressing TR alpha 1, while TR beta 1 suppressed phase 4 depolarization and prolonged action potentials. Consistently, TR alpha 1-infected myocytes exhibited larger I(f) current densities along with increased HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, HCN2 gene expression was not significantly affected by TR beta 1. TR beta 1 exclusively suppressed HCN4 transcription. T3 application led to significant effects only in controls and TR alpha 1-infected cardiomyocytes; whereas, no ligand-dependent actions were observed in TR beta 1-expressing neonatal cardiomyocytes. Our results demonstrate that TR alpha 1 and TR beta 1 divergently regulate cardiac pacing activity.

Specific uncommon mutations KCNJ11give rise to a syndrome defined as developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND), or - more frequently - to a milder sub-type lacking epilepsy, denoted as intermediate-DEND (iDEND). Our aim was to consider a possible monogenic etiology in a 12-yr-old boy with early onset diabetes and mild neurological features. We studied a subject diagnosed with diabetes at 21 months of age, and negative to type 1 diabetes autoantibodies testing. He had learning difficulties during primary school, and a single episode of seizures at the age of 10 yr. We performed direct DNA sequencing of the KCNJ11 gene with subsequent functional study of mutated channels in COSm6 cells. The patient's clinical response to oral glyburide (Glyb) was assessed. Motor coordination was evaluated before and after 6 and 12 months of Glyb therapy. Sequencing of the KCNJ11 gene detected the novel, spontaneous mutation S225T, combined with deletion of amino acids 226-232. In vitro studies revealed that the mutation results in a K(ATP) channel with reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory action of ATP. Glyb improved diabetes control (hemoglobin A1c on insulin: 52 mmol/mol/6.9%; on Glyb: 36 mmol/mol/5.4%) and also performance on motor coordination tests that were impaired before the switch of therapy. We conclude that KCNJ11/S225T, del226-232 mutation caused a mild iDEND form in our patient.

Postmortem histopathological examination of a donor's brain, combined with premortem clinical criteria, is often the most robust approach to correctly classify an individual as a disease-specific case or unaffected control. In this study, we describe iPSCs generated from a skin biopsy collected postmortem during the rapid autopsy of a 75-year-old male, whole body donor, defined as an unaffected neurological control by both clinical and histopathological criteria. These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Selected iPSC clones expressed both nuclear and surface antigens recognized as pluripotency markers of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and were able to differentiate in vitro into neurons and glia. Statistical analysis also demonstrated that fibroblast proliferation was significantly affected by biopsy site, but not donor age (within an elderly cohort). These results provide evidence that autopsy donor-derived fibroblasts can be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs, and may provide an advantageous approach for generating iPSC-based neurological disease models."

PURPOSE: For the last few years wafers of Gliadel have been inserted into the operation cavity in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. This is followed by concurrent radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) according to the Stupp protocol. Only a few studies have investigated this kind of treatment regimen and the impact in terms of survival and toxicity of the combination of Gliadel with TMZ and radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From November 2006 to January 2010, 24 patients with a newly diagnosed glioblastoma have undergone a tumour resection which was considered to be macroscopically complete in 12 cases and with tumour residue in another 12 cases. The mean age at the moment of diagnosis was 60.25years and the median age 63. Twenty-three patients underwent subsequently concurrent radio-chemotherapy with TMZ followed by cycles of elevated doses of TMZ as an adjuvant treatment. One patient had adjuvant radiotherapy alone followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirteen were able to receive 6 or more cycles of adjuvant TMZ. Seven patients had received less than 6 cycles of TMZ as an adjuvant therapy. Two patients did not receive adjuvant TMZ at all. RESULTS: The median overall survival of our group was 19.2months and the median progression free survival was 12.3months. Overall survival for the macroscopically complete-resection patients was 14months, and 12.85months in subtotal-resection patients. The median OS was 14.25months for patients PS 0 - 1 at the moment of diagnosis and 12.65 for PS 2 patients. Chemotherapy with TMZ had to be stopped prematurely in 10 cases due to haematotoxicity, digestive toxicity or early relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant use of surgery with implantation of BCNU wafers and radio-chemotherapy seems to be well tolerated. Despite the small number of patients treated in our group, particular attention should be paid to the potential haematological consequences of this multimodal treatment regimen."

PURPOSE: The authors describe the clinical feature of ten patients with a new syndrome characterized by the presence of retinal vasculitis, multiple macroaneurysms, neuro-retinitis, and peripheral capillary nonperfusion. METHODS: The authors evaluated ten patients identified to have clinical features compatible with the syndrome of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms and neuroretinits (IRVAN). Clinical examination findings, sequential funds photographs (when available), fluorescein angiograms, systemic investigations, response to therapy, and visual outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven eyes of four patients sustained a marked decrease in visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Visual loss was due to a combination of an exudative maculopathy and sequelae of retinal ischemia. Capillary nonperfusion was seen in all ten patients and was severe enough to warrant panretinal laser photocoagulation in six patients. Systemic investigations were uniformly noncontributory. Oral prednisone appears to have little beneficial effects on patients with this disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IRVAN have characteristic retinal features that readily identify this syndrome. An increased awareness of this rare syndrome may help to identify sight-threatening complications at an earlier stage. The authors caution against extensive medical investigations."

Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) lead to dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B, while a different set of DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B."

The novel RYR2-S4153R mutation has been implicated as a cause of CPVT and atrial fibrillation. The mutation has been functionally characterized via store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) and tritium-labelled ryanodine ([(3)H]ryanodine) binding assays.

BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff tendon is known to exert a shear force between the superficial and deep layers. Owing to this characteristic, separate repair of delaminated rotator cuff tears has been introduced for the restoration of the physiological biomechanics of the rotator cuff. However, whether conventional en masse repair or separate repair is superior is controversial in terms of outcomes. PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer double-row repair for the treatment of delaminated rotator cuff tears. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Between August 2007 and March 2014, a total of 82 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated tear were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 48), arthroscopic conventional en masse repair was performed. In group 2 (n = 34), separate double-layer double-row repair was performed. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before surgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery; and at the last follow-up visit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 12 months postoperatively to examine the retear rate and pattern. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between groups in the preoperative demographic data, including patient age, sex, symptom duration, tear size, and functional scores (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 25.9 \u00b1 1.2 months. Significant improvements in functional and pain scores were observed in both groups at the last follow-up visit. However, no significant differences in functional scores and ROM were found between the 2 groups at each time point, except that group 2 had significantly lower VAS pain scores (P < .05) at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Eight (17%) of 48 patients in group 1 and 6 (18%) of 34 patients in group 2 showed retears on MRI at 12-month follow-up (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Both conventional en masse repair and separate double-layer double-row repair were effective in improving clinical outcomes in the treatment of delaminated rotator cuff tears. Lower pain scores were seen in patients who underwent separate double-layer double-row repair."

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histopathologic picture of a childhood-onset, severe variant of scapuloperoneal MD with rigidity of the spine. BACKGROUND: Rigidity of the spine is a feature of numerous syndromes, including X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD, Bethlem myopathy, and the rigid spine syndrome. These are, however, relatively static or very slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders, usually associated with preserved ambulation into adult life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five unrelated children (three boys and two girls) presented in the first 2 years of life with poor neck control, waddling gait, and frequent falls. Early wasting of the distal leg muscles, biceps, triceps, and neck muscles was noted in all patients, and all had contractures and severe rigidity of the spine. The condition progressed rapidly, and all patients lost ambulation before the age of 8 years. Cardiac function was normal in all. RESULTS: Creatine kinase was moderately elevated in all, and muscle biopsy specimens showed nonspecific dystrophic changes with normal expression of dystrophin, the sarcoglycans, and laminin alpha2, alpha5, beta1, and gamma1 chains. Emerin expression was normal in two of the boys whose tissue was available for study. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of weakness, wasting, and contractures of the patients described resembled Emery-Dreifuss MD, but the rapid progression of weakness and contractures and the involvement of both sexes together with normal emerin expression suggest that this form is not X-linked Emery-Dreifuss MD. We suggest that these patients represent a severe MD characterized by early onset distal wasting and severe rigidity of the spine, with probable autosomal recessive inheritance."

Patients were stratified according to whether or not there were bone metastases only. Four hundred twelve patients entered this trial; 378 were assessable for tolerability and 365 for efficacy. The overall response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%), but both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006, respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance. No difference in survival was observed between epirubicin- and FEC 50-group patients, even though the response rate was significantly worse in the monochemotherapy group."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with a moderate to severe risk of stroke, from an Australian government-perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin, based on data from the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in AF (ARISTOTLE) trial. The model comprised five health states: 'Alive, no major bleeding or stroke', 'Alive, no major bleeding, post stroke/systemic embolism', 'Alive, post major bleeding, no stroke', 'Alive, post-major bleeding and stroke' and 'Dead'. Disease cost data was derived from the North-East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study and the Australian Refined Diagnose Related Groups. Costs of medications were based on data from the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. Utility data was derived from published sources, and an annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The main outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life year gained (LYG) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Over 20 years, in the sample of 1000 subjects the model predicted that compared to warfarin, apixaban led to a (discounted) of 0.33 LYG and 0.31 QALYs gained, at a net cost of $4,308 per-person. These equated to ICERs of $AUD12, 914 per LYG and $AUD13, 679 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that apixaban was cost-effective at 99.0% probability using willingness to pay thresholds of $AUD45 000 per LYG and QALY. CONCLUSION: Compared to warfarin, apixaban is likely to represent a cost-effective means of preventing stroke-related morbidity and mortality in patients with AF."

Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) have been derived from somatic cells by the forced expression of several transcription factors. iPS cells resemble embryonic stem cells in many respects. Therefore, iPS cells represent a powerful tool for the study of gene function. In this study, we have investigated whether iPS cells derived from Cdyl-/- and Cdyl+/+ fibroblasts have different characteristics. Our results showed that both Cdyl-/- and Cdyl+/+ fibroblasts could be induced to become iPS cells, but the spontaneous neuronal differentiation capacity of Cdyl-/- iPS cells was much greater than that of the Cdyl+/+ iPS cells. These results provide some insight into the molecular function of the Cdyl gene, showing that it inhibited the neuronal differentiation of iPS cells."

Here we discuss recent advancements in iPSC reprogramming and introduce mathematical approaches to help map the landscape between cell states during reprogramming. Our modelization indicates that OSKM expression diminishes and/or changes potential barriers between cell states and that epigenetic remodeling facilitate these transitions. From a practical perspective, the modeling approaches outlined here allow us to predict the time necessary to create a given number of iPSC colonies or the number of reprogrammed cells generated in a given time. Additional investigations will help to further refine modeling strategies, rendering them applicable toward the study of the development and stability of cancer cells or even other reprogramming processes such as lineage conversion. Ultimately, a quantitative understanding of cell state transitions might facilitate the establishment of regenerative medicine strategies and enhance the translation of reprogramming technologies into the clinic."

The plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid or IAA) regulates plant development by inducing rapid cellular responses and changes in gene expression. Auxin promotes the degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, thereby allowing auxin response factors (ARFs) to activate the transcription of auxin-responsive genes. Auxin enhances the binding of Aux/IAA proteins to the receptor TIR1, which is an F-box protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1). Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking. Here we used an Arabidopsis cell suspension-based protoplast system to find evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12. Each of these proteins showed a distinct abundance and repressor activity when expressed in this cell system. Moreover, the amount of endogenous TIR1 protein appeared to be rate-limiting for a proper auxin response measured by the co-transfected DR5::GUS reporter construct. Co-transfection with 35S::TIR1 led to auxin-dependent degradation, and excess of 35S::TIR1 even led to degradation of Aux/IAAs in the absence of auxin treatment. Expression of the mutant tir1-1 protein or the related F-box protein COI1, which is involved in jasmonate signaling, had no effect on Aux/IAA degradation. Our results show that SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12 are poly-ubiquitinated and degraded in response to increased auxin or TIR1 levels. In conclusion, our data provide experimental support for the model that SCF(TIR1)-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins marks these proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, leading to activation of auxin-responsive gene expression."

Loss-of-function mutations of EZH2, a catalytic component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), are observed in ~\\n10% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but are rare in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Recent studies have shown that EZH2 mutations are often associated with RUNX1 mutations in MDS patients, although its pathological function remains to be addressed. Here we establish an MDS mouse model by transducing a RUNX1S291fs mutant into hematopoietic stem cells and subsequently deleting Ezh2. Ezh2 loss significantly promotes RUNX1S291fs-induced MDS. Despite their compromised proliferative capacity of RUNX1S291fs/Ezh2-null MDS cells, MDS bone marrow impairs normal hematopoietic cells via selectively activating inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby allowing propagation of MDS clones. In contrast, loss of Ezh2 prevents the transformation of AML via PRC1-mediated repression of Hoxa9. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of how Ezh2 loss collaborates with RUNX1 mutants in the pathogenesis of MDS in both cell autonomous and non-autonomous manners."

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) has been challenging over decades, mostly due to a number of difficulties associated with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), which have been the most effective stroke prevention treatment for a long time. The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) and oral direct inhibitors of factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban) have emerged recently as an alternative to VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. These drugs act rapidly, and have a predictable and stable dose-related anticoagulant effect with a few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The novel oral anticoagulants are used in fixed doses with no need for regular laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation intensity. However, each of these drugs has distinct pharmacological properties that could influence optimal use in clinical practice. The following phase 3 randomized trials with novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for stroke prevention in AF have been completed: the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial with dabigatran, the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial with rivaroxaban, and the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolism Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial with apixaban. Moreover, the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to prevent Strokes (AVERROES) trial included patients with AF who have failed or were unsuitable for warfarin, and compared apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Overall, apixaban has two large trials for stroke prevention in AF showing benefits not only over warfarin, but also over aspirin among those patients who have failed or refused warfarin. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin in the reduction of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality, with a similar reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke and better tolerability. When compared with aspirin in the AVERROES trial, apixaban was associated with more effective reduction of stroke, a similar risk of major bleeding, and better tolerability. In this review article, the authors summarize the current knowledge on novel oral anticoagulants and discuss the clinical aspects of their use for stroke prevention in AF, with particular emphasis on apixaban."

BACKGROUND: Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a multisystem disorder arising from underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. Renal impairment and related pathological changes have been reported, but data on its prevalence, response to therapy and impact on survival are still lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 299 patients diagnosed with POEMS syndrome in a tertiary-care university hospital from 2000 until 2014. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was used to define renal impairment and response, according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria. We examined the impact of renal impairment and response on patient survival. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (22.4%) had renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) at baseline. In a multivariate analysis, ascites was independently associated with renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 12.366, P < 0.001]. Renal impairment was reversible in 66.0% of patients receiving therapy and was associated with a shorter time interval between symptom onset and treatment (OR 0.059, P = 0.043) and a vascular endothelial growth factor remission (OR 15.958, P = 0.050) in a multivariate analysis. In terms of therapy, patients with a renal response more commonly received a novel agent-based regimen (P = 0.037), which also led to a shorter response time (P = 0.001). With a median follow-up of 27.4 months, inferior survival was observed in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), but not in those with moderate dysfunction (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), compared with patients without renal impairment. A renal response, if achieved, predicted improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: Renal impairment is a common complication of POEMS syndrome, but can be reversed with effective therapy in most cases."

ELISA was used to identify ETA and double immunodiffusion to identify ETB and ETC. The presence of the ETA gene was detected by a specific DNA probe. ETA (alone or in combination with ETB and/or ETC) was found in 51.9% of the strains, ETB (alone or in combination with ETA and/or ETC) in 76.9% and ETC (in combination with ETA and ETB) in 28.9%. Only 5.8% of strains did not produce any detectable ET. In SDS-PAGE, supernatants of ETB-producing strains showed a pronounced band in either the region of the proteinase zymogen or the active proteinase. There was no correlation between the type of erythrogenic toxin and the serological M or T type of the producing strain. The mitogenic potency of culture supernatants did not differ significantly irrespective of the toxin type(s) present. Culture supernatants of strains without a detectable amount of the known ETs were highly mitogenic, indicating the production of other streptococcal mitogens. A correlation with clinical symptoms was determined with regard to exanthema and fever. Strains producing two or three toxins caused a more intense exanthema. Patient temperature was higher (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) when the infecting strain produced ETB. The toxin-producing patterns of the strains of this study were compared with those isolated during the last epidemic outbreak of scarlet fever in East Germany."

Of the four p38 isoforms known to date, two (p38alpha and p38beta) have been identified as targets for cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs. Recently, it was reported that specific inhibition of the p38alpha isoform is necessary and sufficient for anti-inflammatory efficacy in vivo, while further inhibition of p38beta may not provide any additional benefit. In order to aid the development of p38alpha-selective compounds, the three-dimensional structure of p38beta was determined. To do so, the C162S and C119S,C162S mutants of human MAP kinase p38beta were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Initial screening hits in crystallization trials in the presence of an inhibitor led upon optimization to crystals that diffracted to 2.05 A resolution and allowed structure determination (PDB codes 3gc8 and 3gc9 for the single and double mutant, respectively). The structure of the p38alpha C162S mutant in complex with the same inhibitor is also reported (PDB code 3gc7). A comparison between the structures of the two kinases showed that they are highly similar overall but that there are differences in the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains that causes a reduction in the size of the ATP-binding pocket in p38beta. This difference in size between the two pockets could be exploited in order to achieve selectivity."

The detection of class A serine-carbapenemases among species of Enterobacteriaceae remains a challenging issue. Methods of identification for routine use in clinical microbiology laboratories have not been standardized to date. We developed a novel screening methodology suitable for countries with high basal levels of carbapenem resistance due to non-carbapenemase-mediated mechanisms and standardized several simple confirmatory methods that allow the recognition of bacteria producing class A carbapenemases, including KPC, Sme, IMI, NMC-A, and GES, by using boronic acid (BA) derivatives. A total of 28 genetically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae strains producing several class A carbapenemases were tested. Thirty-eight genetically unrelated negative controls were included. The isolates were tested against imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), and ertapenem (ETP) by MIC and disk diffusion assays in order to select appropriate tools to screen for suspected carbapenemase production. It was possible to differentiate class A carbapenemase-producing bacteria from non-carbapenemase-producing bacteria by using solely the routine IPM susceptibility tests. The modified Hodge test was evaluated and found to be highly sensitive, although false-positive results were documented. Novel BA-based methods (a double-disk synergy test and combined-disk and MIC tests) using IPM, MEM, and ETP, in combination with 3-aminophenylboronic acid as an inhibitor, were designed as confirmatory tools. On the basis of the performance of these methods, a sensitive flow chart for suspicion and confirmation of class A carbapenemase production in species of Enterobacteriaceae was designed. By using this methodology, isolates producing KPC, GES, Sme, IMI, and NMC-A carbapenemases were successfully distinguished from those producing other classes of beta-lactamases (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpCs, and metallo-beta-lactamases, etc).

BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium ulcerans can cause a diphtheria-like illness, especially when the bacterium is lysogenized with a tox gene-carrying bacteriophage that produces diphtheria toxin. Acquisition of toxigenicity upon phage lysogenization is a common feature of C. ulcerans and C. diphtheriae. However, because of a lack of C. ulcerans genome information, a detailed comparison of prophages has not been possible between these two clinically important and closely related bacterial species. RESULTS: We determined the whole genome sequence of the toxigenic C. ulcerans 0102 isolated in Japan. The genomic sequence showed a striking similarity with that of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and, to a lesser extent, with that of C. diphtheriae. The 0102 genome contained three distinct prophages. One of these, \u03a6CULC0102-I, was a tox-positive prophage containing genes in the same structural order as for tox-positive C. diphtheriae prophages. However, the primary structures of the individual genes involved in the phage machinery showed little homology between the two counterparts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that the tox-positive prophage in this strain of C. ulcerans has a distinct origin from that of C. diphtheriae NCTC 13129."

Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression promotes the pathogenesis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, but the mechanisms by which EGFR expression promotes MPNST pathogenesis are poorly understood. We hypothesized that inappropriately expressed EGFRs promote MPNST invasion and found that these kinases are concentrated in MPNST invadopodia in vitro. Epidermal growth factor receptor knockdown inhibited the migration of unstimulated MPNST cells in vitro, and exogenous EGF further enhanced MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, promoting migration on laminin and, to a lesser extent, collagen. In this setting, EGF acts as a chemotactic factor. We also found that the 7 known EGFR ligands (EGF, betacellulin, epiregulin, heparin-binding EGF, transforming growth factor-\u03b1 [TGF-\u03b1], amphiregulin, and epigen) variably enhanced MPNST migration in a concentration-dependent manner, with TGF-\u03b1 being particularly potent. With the exception of epigen, these factors similarly promoted the migration of nonneoplastic Schwann cells. Although transcripts encoding all 7 EGFR ligands were detected in human MPNST cells and tumor tissues, only TGF-\u03b1 was consistently overexpressed and was found to colocalize with EGFR in situ. These data indicate that constitutive EGFR activation, potentially driven by autocrine or paracrine TGF-\u03b1 signaling, promotes the aggressive invasive behavior characteristic of MPNSTs."

Three susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, and the endothelin 3 (EDN3) gene. RET gene mutations were found in significant proportions of familial (50%) and sporadic (15-20%) HSCR, while homozygosity for EDNRB or EDN3 mutations accounted for the rare HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. More recently, heterozygous EDNRB an EDN3 missense mutations have been reported in isolated HSCR patients. Some of these results were obtained after the identification of mouse genes whose natural or site-directed mutations resulted in megacolon and coat color spotting. There is also conclusive evidence for the involvement of other independent loci in HSCR. In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR. The dissection of the genetic etiology of HSCR disease may then provide a unique opportunity to distinguish between a polygenic and a genetically heterogeneous disease, thereby helping to understand other complex disorders and congenital malformations hitherto considered as multifactorial in origin. Finally, the study of the molecular bases of HSCR is also a step towards the understanding of developmental genetics of the enteric nervous system giving support to the role of the tyrosine kinase and endothelin-signaling pathways in the development of neural crest-derived enteric neurons in human."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate, in admitted patients with transient ischemic attack, the accuracy of the ABCD(2) (age [A], blood pressure [B], clinical features [weakness/speech disturbance] [C], transient ischemic attack duration [D], and diabetes history [D]) score in predicting ischemic stroke within 7 days. METHODS: At 16 North Carolina hospitals, we enrolled a prospective, nonconsecutive sample of admitted patients with transient ischemic attack and with no stroke history, presenting within 24 hours of transient ischemic attack symptom onset. We conducted a medical record review to determine ischemic stroke outcomes within 7 days. According to a modified Rankin Scale Score, strokes were classified as disabling (>2) or nondisabling (< or =2). RESULTS: During a 35-month period, we enrolled 1,667 patients, of whom 373 (23%) received a diagnosis of an ischemic stroke within 7 days. Eighteen percent (69/373) of all strokes were disabling. We were unable to calculate an ABCD(2) score in 613 patients (37%); however, our imputed analysis indicated this did not significantly alter results. The discriminatory power of the ABCD(2) score was modest for ischemic stroke in 7 days (c statistic 0.59), and fair for disabling ischemic stroke within 7 days (c statistic 0.71). Patients characterized as low risk according to ABCD(2) score (< or =3) were at low risk for experiencing a disabling stroke within 7 days, with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.64) with missing values excluded and 0.34 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.76) when missing values were imputed. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests the best application of the ABCD(2) score may be to identify patients at low risk for an early disabling ischemic stroke. Further study of the ability to determine an ABCD(2) score in all patients is needed, along with validation in a large, consecutive population of patients with transient ischemic attack."

The mutated KATP channels do not close in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) so the beta-cell membrane is hyperpolarized and insulin secretion does not occur. Some patients have DEND syndrome (developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes) with the neurological features arising from mutated KATP channels in muscle, nerve and brain. Defining a genetic aetiology has not only given insights into clinical classification and disease mechanism, but has also influenced treatment. Sulphonylureas, by binding the sulphonylurea receptor, can close the KATP channel. This has led to patients who were insulin-dependent being able to discontinue insulin injections and achieve excellent control with sulphonylurea tablets. In this article we discuss the work that established Kir6.2 mutations as a common cause of neonatal diabetes, the clinical features, the underlying mechanism and the impact on patient treatment."

Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable). Patients in complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) after 2 chemotherapy courses were eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. After the second chemotherapy cycle, 75% of the patients in the R-DHAP arm had responsive disease (CR or PR) versus 54% in the DHAP arm (P=.01). With a median follow-up of 24 months, there was a significant difference in failure-free survival (FFS24; 50% vs 24% vs, P<.001), and progression free survival (PFS24; 52% vs 31% P<.002) in favor of the R-DHAP arm. Cox-regression analysis demonstrated a significant effect of rituximab treatment on FFS24 (HR 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.57 versus 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.70) and overall-survival (OS24: HR 0.60 [0.41-0.89] vs 0.76 [0.52-1.10]) when adjusted for time since upfront treatment, age, World Health Organization performance status, and secondary age-adjusted international prognostic index.

Uranium biomineralization by a metal-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from uranium mine waste was characterized for its potential in bioremediation. Uranium resistance, its cellular localization and chemical nature of uranium-bacteria interaction were elucidated. Survival and uranium biomineralization from mine water were investigated using microcosm experiments. The selected bacterium showed U resistance and accumulation (maximum of 275 mg U g(-1)cell dry wt.) following incubation in 100 mg U L(-1), pH 4.0, for 6 h. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that bioaccumulated uranium was deposited within the cell envelope as needle shaped U-phosphate compounds that attain crystallinity only at pH 4.0. A synergistic involvement of deprotonated phosphate and carboxyl moieties in facilitating bioprecipitation of uranium was evident from FTIR analysis. Based on these findings we attribute the localized U sequestration by this bacterium as innocuous complex to its possible mechanism of uranium resistance. Microcosm data confirmed that the strain can remove soluble uranium (99%) and sequester it as U oxide and phosphate minerals while maintaining its viability. The study showed that indigenous bacteria from contaminated site that can survive uranium and other heavy metal toxicity and sequester soluble uranium as biominerals could play important role in uranium bioremediation."

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a pre-synaptic disorder of the neuromuscular and autonomic transmission mediated by antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels at the motor nerve terminal. LEMS is a quite rare and probably under-diagnosed disease: the onset may be slow and clinical signs are typically fluctuating, thus adding to the delay in diagnosis. LEMS weakness typically involves lower and upper limbs and the proximal muscles are predominantly affected. A significant proportion of patients also have dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that may include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension. LEMS recognition is based on clinical, electrophysiological and immunological criteria. Nearly 50-60% of patients with LEMS have an underlying tumour that, in almost all cases, is a small-cell lung cancer; the onset of neurological symptoms generally precedes tumour detection. A careful screening for the early detection of the possible associated cancer is a crucial step for optimal disease management. The Italian Working Group on Myasthenic Syndromes developed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that could serve in routine clinical practice as tools for a patient-tailored approach."

Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. In this review, we will concentrate on the roles of protein aggregation, nuclear localization and proteolytic processing in disease pathogenesis. In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression. Taken together, these data lead towards a model whereby proteolytic processing, nuclear localization and protein aggregation all contribute to pathogenesis."

These traits are controlled by neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of amines, has been reported to be associated with aggression, impulsivity, depression, and mood changes. We hypothesized that MAOA can have a potential role in ADHD associated CD/ODD and analyzed 24 markers in a group of Indo-Caucasoid subjects. ADHD probands and controls (N = 150 each) matched for ethnicity and gender were recruited following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV. Appropriate scales were used for measuring CD and ODD traits. Markers were genotyped by PCR-based methods and data obtained analyzed using the Cocaphase program under UNPHASED. Only eight markers were found to be polymorphic. rs6323 \"G\" allele showed higher frequencies in ADHD (P = 0.0023), ADHD + CD (P = 0.03) and ADHD + ODD (P = 0.01) as compared to controls. Haplotype analysis revealed statistically significant difference for three haplotypes in ADHD cases (P < 0.02). Statistically significant differences were also noticed for haplotypes in ADHD + CD and ADHD + ODD cases (P < 0.01). LD analysis showed significant variation in different groups. Multidimensionality reduction analysis showed independent as well as interactive effects of markers. Genotypes showed correlation with behavioral problems in ADHD and ADHD + CD.

It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression. Insomnia is the most frequent reason for prescription of trazodone. It has also been proven useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Other off-label uses include the treatment of bulimia, benzodiazepine/alcohol dependence, fibromyalgia, central nervous system degenerative diseases (behavioral disorders in dementia and other organic disorders), schizophrenia, chronic pain disease and diabetic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction. AREAS COVERED: This paper evaluates trazodone's efficacy and safety in its off-label uses. It also discusses the possibility that a combination of trazodone with SSRIs may prevent or treat some of the SSRI side effects, such as anxiety, insomnia and sexual dysfunction, in addition to synergically increasing SSRIs' antidepressant activity. EXPERT OPINION: Few clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate trazodone's efficacy in the treatment of the diseases and symptoms for which it is often used in clinical practice. More studies are necessary to investigate possible new therapeutic indications, and to scientifically demonstrate the risk/benefit ratio for the many conditions for which trazodone is used, but not approved by the FDA."

Human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) inhibit replication of Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 Vif overcomes these host restriction factors by binding to them and inducing their proteasomal degradation. The Vif-A3G and Vif-A3F interactions are attractive targets for antiviral drug development because inhibiting the interactions could allow the host defense mechanism to control HIV-1 replication. It was recently reported that the Vif amino acids D(14)RMR(17) are important for functional interaction and degradation of the previously identified Vif-resistant mutant of A3G (D128K-A3G). However, the Vif determinants important for functional interaction with A3G and A3F have not been fully characterized. To identify these determinants, we performed an extensive mutational analysis of HIV-1 Vif. Our analysis revealed two distinct Vif determinants, amino acids Y(40)RHHY(44) and D(14)RMR(17), which are essential for binding to A3G and A3F, respectively. Interestingly, mutation of the A3G-binding region increased Vif's ability to suppress A3F. Vif binding to D128K-A3G was also dependent on the Y(40)RHHY(44) region but not the D(14)RMR(17) region. Consistent with previous observations, subsequent neutralization of the D128K-A3G antiviral activity required substitution of Vif determinant D(14)RMR(17) with SEMQ, similar to the SERQ amino acids in simian immunodeficiency virus SIV(AGM) Vif, which is capable of neutralizing D128K-A3G. These studies are the first to clearly identify two distinct regions of Vif that are critical for independent interactions with A3G and A3F. Pharmacological interference with the Vif-A3G or Vif-A3F interactions could result in potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication by the APOBEC3 proteins."

Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), a noncollagenous extracellular protein, plays critical roles in bone mineralization and phosphate homeostasis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in DMP1 gene have been identified as the molecular cause of ARHR. Here, we describe a Japanese family that includes two ARHR-affected siblings carrying a novel mutation of the DMP1 gene. The patients were a 53-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man with short stature and skeletal deformities who were the offspring of a first-cousin marriage. Biochemical examination revealed hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate excretion and low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D. Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium excretion were within the normal range, leading to clinical diagnosis of ARHR. Sequence analysis of peripheral leukocytes from the patients revealed that they carried a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the DMP1 gene (98G>A, W33X), which leads to a truncated DMP protein with no putative biological function. Unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation. This is the first report of a Japanese family with ARHR carrying a novel mutation of the DMP1 gene."

Disassembly of the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) DNA helicase is the key regulated step during DNA replication termination in eukaryotes, involving ubiquitylation of the Mcm7 helicase subunit, leading to a disassembly process that requires the Cdc48 \"segregase\". Here, we employ a screen to identify partners of budding yeast Cdc48 that are important for disassembly of ubiquitylated CMG helicase at the end of chromosome replication. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin-binding Ufd1-Npl4 complex recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG. Ubiquitylation of CMG in yeast cell extracts is dependent upon lysine 29 of Mcm7, which is the only detectable site of ubiquitylation both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (though in\u00a0vivo other sites can be modified when K29 is mutated). Mutation of K29 abrogates in\u00a0vitro recruitment of Ufd1-Npl4-Cdc48 to the CMG helicase, supporting a model whereby Ufd1-Npl4 recruits Cdc48 to ubiquitylated CMG at the end of chromosome replication, thereby driving the disassembly reaction."

The dimer formed by the ATF-2 and c-Jun transcription factors is one of the main components of the human interferon-beta enhanceosome. Although these two transcription factors are able to form two homodimers and one heterodimer, it is mainly the heterodimer that participates in the formation of this enhanceosome, binding specifically to the positive regulatory domain IV (PRDIV) site of the enhancer DNA. To understand this surprising advantage of the heterodimer, we investigated the association of these transcription factors using fragments containing the basic DNA-recognition segment and the basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP). It was found that the probability of forming the hetero-bZIP significantly exceeds the probability of forming homo-bZIPs, and that the hetero-bZIP interacts more strongly with the PRDIV site of the interferon-beta enhancer, especially in the orientation that places the folded ATF-2 basic segment in the upstream half of this asymmetric site. The effect of salt on the formation of the ATF-2/c-Jun dimer and on its ability to bind the target PRDIV site showed that electrostatic interactions between the charged groups of these proteins and with DNA play an essential role in the formation of the asymmetric ATF-2/c-Jun/PRDIV complex."

BACKGROUND: Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS) is a developmental disorder characterised by reduced growth, microcephaly, ocular anomalies (microcornea, strabismus, myopia, and pale optic disk), distinctive facial features (narrow palpebral fissures, telecanthus, sparse and laterally broad eyebrows, preauricular tags, and micrognathia), mental retardation, and generalised hypotonia. KOS is a rare, possibly underestimated condition, with fewer than 10 cases reported to date. Here we investigate the molecular cause underlying KOS. METHODS: An exome sequencing approach was used on a single affected individual of an Italian consanguineous family coupled with mutation scanning using Sanger sequencing on a second unrelated subject with clinical features fitting the disorder. RESULTS: Exome sequencing was able to identify homozygosity for a novel truncating mutation (c.556C>T, p.Arg186stop) in UBE3B, which encodes a widely expressed HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Homozygosity for a different nonsense lesion affecting the gene (c.1166G>A, p.Trp389stop) was documented in the second affected subject, supporting the recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder. Mutation scanning of the entire UBE3B coding sequence on a selected cohort of subjects with features overlapping, in part, those recurring in KOS did not reveal disease-causing mutations, suggesting phenotypic homogeneity of UBE3B lesions. DISCUSSION: Our data provide evidence that KOS is caused by UBE3B loss of function, and further demonstrate the impact of misregulation of protein ubiquitination on development and growth. The available clinical records, including those referring to four UBE3B mutation-positive subjects recently described as belonging to a previously unreported entity, which fits KOS, document the clinical homogeneity of this disorder."

These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming."

This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-\u00df-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks. Also, we examined how additional acute immobilization stress changes the mentioned parameters. Treadmill running did not result in modulation of gene expression of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes and it decreased the level of CREB mRNA in the adrenal medulla of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats. The potentially negative physiological adaptations after treadmill running were recorded as increased concentrations of catecholamines and decreased morning CORT concentration in the plasma, as well as the adrenal gland hypertrophy of chronically psychosocially stressed rats. The additional acute immobilization stress increases gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes in the adrenal medulla, as well as catecholamines and CORT levels in the plasma.

Coxsackie B viruses (types 1 to 5) are the most frequent reported cause of acute viral myocarditis. To study the pathogenesis of the disease at the cellular level, we simulated an infectious situation by infecting cultured human foetal heart cells with Coxsackie B3 (CB3) virus. Successful replication of this virus could be demonstrated by the presence of virus particles inside cultivated foetal myocytes together with high titres of progeny virus of 10(8) plaque-forming units (PFU) per millilitre culture medium. Within 9 h of infection networks of myocytes lost their ability to contract spontaneously followed by disintegration and replacement by overgrowing fibroblasts which survived the infection. These cells produced CB3 virus continuously over several months, indicating carrier state infection of human myocardial fibroblasts. Human fibroblasts interferon (IFN-beta) was found to act as a potent inhibitor of the replication of this virus. Virus yields could be reduced from 1.2 x 1.8 x 10(5) PFU/ml culture medium when human heart cells were incubated with IFN-beta 20 h prior to challenge with a high input multiplicity of 50 PFU of CB3 virus per cell, demonstrating the major protective role of IFN-beta in CB3 viral infection. It thus appear that IFN-beta might become useful as an antiviral agent in the treatment of Coxsackie myocarditis."

OBJECTIVES: Uterine myomas may change the concentrations of the screening serum markers and therefore alter the risk calculation of the fetal chromosomal abnormalities. An increased risk leads to invasive diagnostics procedures which in these cases can often be technically difficult due to the presence of myomas. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of uterine myomas on the first and second trimester serum markers concentrations and, possibly on the test results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 127 women between 11 and 20 weeks of normal singleton pregnancy. In each case uterine myomas were diagnosed--over 20 mm in the diameter and located in the uterine wall. 77 patients underwent the first trimester screening (PAPP-A & free beta-hCG) and 50 patients had the second trimester screening (triple test). The control group consisted of 1020 women between 11 and 20 weeks of normal singleton pregnancy without uterine myomas. Delfia Xpress analyser was used for the serum markers estimations. All pregnant women delivered normal healthy babies. RESULTS: In the first trimester group the PAPP-A serum concentrations were not different from the controls while the mean median concentration of free beta-hCG were significant higher--1.43 MoM. In the second trimester group the following mean median values were observed: no significance for the AFP--1.18 MoM and estriol--1.29 MoM and significantly higher mean median value for the free beta-hCG--2.01 MoM. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The presence of the uterine myomas is connected with the increased maternal serum concentration of the beta-hCG, particularly in the second trimester. 2. The uterine myomas may lead to the increased rate of the false positive results of the prenatal screening test, especially the triple test."

We examined the association of the age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score, a validated risk prediction model for stroke after TIA, and the presence of ICS or ECS. METHODS: Vascular imaging and ABCD2 scores were obtained in a retrospective cohort of 77 consecutive patients diagnosed with TIA in a single center emergency department. The association between vascular stenosis and ABCD2 scores and how each related to clinical outcome was examined. RESULTS: In all, 30 (39.2%) TIA patients had 37 stenotic lesions; 15 (40.5%) stenotic lesions were ICS and 22 (59.5%) stenotic lesions were ECS. A total of 7 patients (9.5%) had both ECS and ICS lesions. Patients with ABCD2 > 3 were more likely to have ICS (odds ratio [OR] = 6.25, confidence interval [CI] 1.39-32.44, P = .009) and ECS (OR = 5.25, CI = 1.56-17.66, P = .005). Of the 37 stenotic lesions, 21 (56.7%) were symptomatic; 4 (19.2%) of these had an ABCD2 < 3. At 7 days, there were 4 ischemic strokes, 3 had previously demonstrated symptomatic stenotic lesions, and all had ABCD2 scores > 3. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients in the low-risk ABCD2 scores, the patients with medium- to high-risk ABCD2 scores are more likely to have symptomatic and asymptomatic vascular stenotic lesions. However, 1 in 5 patients with low-risk ABCD2 score has symptomatic stenotic lesions, indicating ABCD2 score does not identify all patients with symptomatic stenotic lesions."

PURPOSE: To determine whether the duration and the dose of epirubicin modify the long-term outcome of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred seventeen anthracycline-naive MBC patients were randomized to receive one of the following regimens: arm A: 11 cycles of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC 75) every 21 days; arm B: four cycles of FEC 100 (same regimen but with epirubicin 100 mg/m(2)) then eight cycles of FEC 50 (epirubicin 50 mg/m(2)); and arm C: four cycles of FEC 100 then restart the same regimen at disease progression in case of prior response or stabilization. RESULTS: Hematologic toxicity was similar. Nausea/vomiting and stomatitis were significantly less frequent in arm A as was left ventricular ejection fraction decrease in arm C (A = six patients, B = five patients, and C = one patient). Six patients died of infections (A = four patients and C = two patients). After four cycles, the objective response rate (ORR) was better with FEC 100 than with FEC 75 (49.2% v 40%, respectively; P: =.07). The ORR was better with the longer regimens (arm A, 56.9%; B, 64%; and C, 47.6%; P: =.06) and was 41% after second-line FEC 100. After a median follow-up of 41 months, the response duration and time to progression (TTP) were significantly better with arm B, the longer regimen (P: =.012 and P: < 10(-3), respectively). The median survival times for arms A, B, and C were similar (17.9, 18.9, and 16. 3 months, respectively; P: =.49). CONCLUSION: In MBC, longer epirubicin-based regimens are better in terms of response duration and TTP. FEC 100 regimens improve the ORR. However, four initial cycles of FEC 100 and identical retreatment at disease progression yielded equivalent overall survival to longer regimens."

BACKGROUND: Remnant lipoproteinemia is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) diseases. This study examined which of 2 common lipid-lowering drugs (fibrates and statins) is more effective in patients with remnant lipoproteinemia and if lowering remnant lipoprotein levels can reduce CV risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Remnant lipoprotein levels were measured by an immunoseparation method (remnant-like lipoprotein particles cholesterol: RLP-C) in 274 patients with coronary artery disease and high RLP-C levels (>or=5.0 mg/dl). They were randomly assigned to receive bezafibrate (200-400 mg/day) or pravastatin (10-20 mg/day), and were prospectively followed-up for 1 year or until the occurrence of CV events. Complete follow-up data were obtained in 180 patients. RLP-C levels at 1 year of treatment were reduced more by bezafibrate than pravastatin (37% and 25% from baseline, respectively). During follow-up, bezafibrate-treated patients had 3 CV events, compared with 12 events in pravastatin-treated patients (P<0.01). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, a decrease in RLP-C level was significantly associated with a reduction in CV events after adjustment for treatment group and changes in levels of other lipids. CONCLUSIONS: Bezafibrate therapy decreased RLP-C levels to a greater extent than pravastatin and a decrease in RLP-C level may be associated with a reduction in CV events in patients with high RLP-C levels."

OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, an oral direct factor Xa-inhibitor was non-inferior to adjusted dose warfarin in the prevention of stroke and embolism among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ROCKET-AF trial and has been approved for stroke prevention in AF. CASE REPORT: A 88-years-old female (body-mass-index = 19.95) with AF, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, hospitalized because of heart failure and a non-convulsive epileptic state, was treated by valproate, mirtazepin, nebivolol, digitoxin, lisinopril, gliclazide and amlodipine. Irrespective of renal insufficiency, rivaroxaban 15 mg/d was started. After 3 days rivaroxaban was stopped because of concerns about the bleeding risk. Coagulation tests 28 h after rivaroxaban-intake showed INR 2.26, PT 35%, aPTT 38.3 s and anti-Factor Xa-activity 2.00 U/ml. Explanations for the prolonged anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban comprise renal failure, the low body-mass-index, the advanced age and drug-drug interactions of rivaroxaban with mirtazepin, valproate and amlodipine. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should consider renal function, concomitant medication, polymorbidity and age prior to prescribing rivaroxaban. Care has to be taken when prescribing rivaroxaban to patients who are different from those included in the ROCKET AF trial."

Defects in the pathway can result in overgrowth phenotypes due to deregulation of stem-cell proliferation and apoptosis; members of the pathway are directly involved in cancer development. The pharmacological regulation of the pathway might be useful in cancer prevention, treatment, and regenerative medicine applications; currently, a few compounds can selectively modulate the pathway.

Of the five histone methyltransferases known to mediate methylation of the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9), euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2; also known as G9a) has been shown to be a primary mediator of H3K9 dimethylation; BIX-01294 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of EHMT2. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of BIX-01294 treatment on global H3K9 dimethylation in porcine embryos. We hypothesised that inhibition of EHMT2 by BIX-01294 would result in reduced levels of H3K9 dimethylation and compromised embryo development. Our results showed that incubation in 5\u00b5M BIX-01294 markedly reduced global levels of H3K9 dimethylation at the pronuclear, 2-cell and 4-cell stages of development and resulted in developmental arrest before blastocyst formation. Although transient exposure of embryos to BIX-01294 did not alter in vitro development, embryos transiently exposed to BIX-01294 did not establish pregnancy. These data demonstrate that BIX-01294 is a potent inhibitor of H3K9 dimethylation and that transient alterations in global histone modifications can have profound effects on embryo developmental potential."

Thus, super-enhancers can be used as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Current studies have identified super-enhancers in more than 100 cell types and demonstrated their functional importance. However, a centralized resource to integrate all these findings is not currently available. We developed dbSUPER (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/), the first integrated and interactive database of super-enhancers, with the primary goal of providing a resource for assistance in further studies related to transcriptional control of cell identity and disease. dbSUPER provides a responsive and user-friendly web interface to facilitate efficient and comprehensive search and browsing. The data can be easily sent to Galaxy instances, GREAT and Cistrome web-servers for downstream analysis, and can also be visualized in the UCSC genome browser where custom tracks can be added automatically. The data can be downloaded and exported in variety of formats. Furthermore, dbSUPER lists genes associated with super-enhancers and also links to external databases such as GeneCards, UniProt and Entrez. dbSUPER also provides an overlap analysis tool to annotate user-defined regions. We believe dbSUPER is a valuable resource for the biology and genetic research communities."

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is characterized by abnormal vascular structures that may present as epistaxis, telangiectasias, and/or arteriovenous malformations. The genes associated with HHT (ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4) are members of the TGF\u03b2 pathway. Other syndromes associated with abnormalities in TGF\u03b2 signaling include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and related disorders. These disorders have aortic disease as a prominent finding. While there are case reports of patients with HHT and aortopathy (dilatation/aneurysm, dissection, and rupture), this has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history. Z scores and nomograms were utilized to identify abnormal results. Twenty-six patients from 15 families (one ACVRL1, four ENG, eight SMAD4, and two clinical diagnoses) were included in the analysis. Aortopathy was found in 6/26 (23%) patients; all had SMAD4 mutations. In our cohort, 6/16 (38%) SMAD4 mutation carriers had evidence of aortopathy. These data suggest that aortopathy could be part of the spectrum of SMAD4-induced HHT manifestations. Routine aortic imaging, including measurements of the aorta, should be considered in patients with SMAD4 mutations to allow for appropriate medical and surgical recommendations."

Loss-of-function mutations of EZH2, a catalytic component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), are observed in ~\\n10% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but are rare in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Recent studies have shown that EZH2 mutations are often associated with RUNX1 mutations in MDS patients, although its pathological function remains to be addressed. Here we establish an MDS mouse model by transducing a RUNX1S291fs mutant into hematopoietic stem cells and subsequently deleting Ezh2. Ezh2 loss significantly promotes RUNX1S291fs-induced MDS. Despite their compromised proliferative capacity of RUNX1S291fs/Ezh2-null MDS cells, MDS bone marrow impairs normal hematopoietic cells via selectively activating inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby allowing propagation of MDS clones. In contrast, loss of Ezh2 prevents the transformation of AML via PRC1-mediated repression of Hoxa9. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of how Ezh2 loss collaborates with RUNX1 mutants in the pathogenesis of MDS in both cell autonomous and non-autonomous manners."

PURPOSE: Prevalence and long-term outcome of epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is reported to be variable, and the reasons for this variability are still controversial. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical characteristics of patients with TSC who were regularly followed since 2000 at the San Paolo Multidisciplinary Tuberous Sclerosis Centre in Milan, Italy. From patient charts we collected data about age at epilepsy onset, seizure frequency and seizure type, history of infantile spasms (IS), epileptic syndrome, evolution to refractory epilepsy or to seizure freedom and/or medication freedom, electroencephalography (EEG) features, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, cognitive outcome, and genetic background. KEY FINDINGS: Among the 160 subjects (120 adults and 40 children), 116 (72.5%) had epilepsy: 57 (35.6%) were seizure-free, and 59 (36.9%) had drug-resistant epilepsy. Most seizure-free patients had a focal epilepsy (89.5%), with 54.4% of them drug resistant for a period of their lives. Epilepsy onset in the first year of life with IS and/or focal seizures was characteristic of the drug-resistant group of patients, as well as cognitive impairment and TSC2 mutation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A small group of patients (7 patients, 4.4%) experienced a seizure only once; all of them had normal cognition. SIGNIFICANCE: Although epilepsy management can be challenging in TSC, more than one third of patients had their seizures controlled: through monotherapy in 56% and by polytherapy in 32%. Moreover, 12% of the patients became seizure-free and were off medication. Identifying predictive features of epilepsy and cognitive outcome can ensure better management for patients with TSC and delineate genotype-phenotype correlations."

Ectopic expression of key reprogramming transgenes in somatic cells enables them to adopt the characteristics of pluripotency. Such cells have been termed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and have revolutionized the field of somatic cell reprogramming, as the need for embryonic material is obviated. One of the issues facing both the clinical translation of iPS cell technology and the efficient derivation of iPS cell lines in the research laboratory is choosing the most appropriate somatic cell type for induction. In this study, we demonstrate the direct reprogramming of a defined population of neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) and adipose tissue-derived cells (ADCs) from adult mice using retroviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, and compared the results obtained with a mouse embryonic fibroblast (mEF) control. We isolated mEFs, NSCs, and ADCs from transgenic mice, which possess a GFP transgene under control of the Oct4 promoter, and validated GFP expression as an indicator of reprogramming. While transduction efficiencies were not significantly different among the different cell types (mEFs 68.70 +/- 2.62%, ADCs 70.61 +/- 15.4%, NSCs, 68.72 +/- 3%, p = 0.97), the number of GFP-positive colonies and hence the number of reprogramming events was significantly higher for both NSCs (13.50 +/- 4.10 colonies, 0.13 +/- 0.06%) and ADCs (118.20 +/- 38.28 colonies, 1.14 +/- 0.77%) when compared with the mEF control (3.17 +/- 0.29 colonies, 0.03 +/- 0.005%). ADCs were most amenable to reprogramming with an 8- and 38-fold greater reprogramming efficiency than NSCs and mEFs, respectively. Both NSC iPS and ADC iPS cells were demonstrated to express markers of pluripotency and could differentiate to the three germ layers, both in vitro and in vivo, to cells representative of the three germ lineages. Our findings confirm that ADCs are an ideal candidate as a readily accessible somatic cell type for high efficiency establishment of iPS cell lines."

We aim to study the SCN5A gene in a cohort of Brugada syndrome (BS) patients and evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation. BS is caused by mutations in up to 10 different genes, SCN5A being the most frequently involved. Large genomic rearrangements in SCN5A have been associated with conduction disease, but its prevalence in BS is unknown. Seventy-six non-related patients with BS were studied. Clinical characteristics and family risk profile were recorded. Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively. Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X). Patients with mutations had a trend toward a higher proportion of spontaneous type I Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) (87.5% vs 52.9%, p = 0.06) and had evidence of familial disease (62.5%, vs 23.5%, p = 0.03). The symptoms and risk profile of the carriers were not different from wild-type probands. There were non-significant differences in the prevalence of type I ECG, syncope and history of arrhythmia in carriers of selected polymorphisms. None of the patients had any deletion/duplication in the SCN5A gene. In conclusion, 10.5% of our patients had mutations in the SCN5A gene. Patients with mutations seemed to have more spontaneous type I ECG, but no differences in syncope or arrhythmic events compared with patients without mutations. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the SCN5A in the expression of the phenotype and prognosis. Large rearrangements were not identified in the SCN5A gene using the MLPA technique."

RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the pausing complex, NELF and DSIF, are detected near the transcription start site (TSS) of many active and silent genes. Active transcription starts when the pause release factor P-TEFb is recruited to initiate productive elongation. However, the mechanism of P-TEFb recruitment and regulation of NELF/DSIF during transcription is not fully understood. We investigated this question in interferon (IFN)-stimulated transcription, focusing on BRD4, a BET family protein that interacts with P-TEFb. Besides P-TEFb, BRD4 binds to acetylated histones through the bromodomain. We found that BRD4 and P-TEFb, although not present prior to IFN treatment, were robustly recruited to IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) after stimulation. Likewise, NELF and DSIF prior to stimulation were hardly detectable on ISGs, which were strongly recruited after IFN treatment. A shRNA-based knockdown assay of NELF revealed that it negatively regulates the passage of Pol II and DSIF across the ISGs during elongation, reducing total ISG transcript output. Analyses with a BRD4 small-molecule inhibitor showed that IFN-induced recruitment of P-TEFb and NELF/DSIF was under the control of BRD4. We suggest a model where BRD4 coordinates both positive and negative regulation of ISG elongation."

Sudden cardiac death is the most devastating manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and often occurs in young and previously asymptomatic patients. Therefore, risk stratification for sudden death has a major role in the management of HCM and has acquired even greater relevance since the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has proved to be highly effective in preventing sudden death in this disease. The ICD is definitely indicated for secondary prevention of sudden death in patients with HCM who have survived a cardiac arrest with documented ventricular fibrillation, or experienced one or more episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. However, uncertainties persist regarding the precise selection of patients for primary prophylactic ICD implantation. A number of risk markers are used to assess the magnitude of risk, including family history of premature sudden death; extreme left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (> 30 mm) in young patients; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter electrocardiographic recording; unexplained (not neurally mediated) syncope, particularly in young patients; and blood pressure decrease or inadequate increase during upright exercise. Multiple risk factors convey a definite increase in risk. However, a single risk factor such as family history of multiple sudden deaths, massive LV hypertrophy in a young patient, or frequent and/or prolonged runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter, may also justify consideration of a prophylactic ICD."

Transcription-coupled DNA repair uses components of the transcription machinery to identify DNA lesions and initiate their repair. These repair pathways are complex, so their mechanistic features remain poorly understood. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Here we use single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation to observe the dynamic interactions of Escherichia coli Mfd with RNA polymerase elongation complexes stalled by a cyclopyrimidine dimer or by nucleotide starvation. We show that Mfd acts by catalysing two irreversible, ATP-dependent transitions with different structural, kinetic and mechanistic features. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors. These results provide a framework for considering the kinetics of transcription-coupled repair in vivo, and open the way to reconstruction of complete DNA repair pathways at single-molecule resolution."

Phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (H3S10P) has been linked to a variety of cellular processes, such as chromosome condensation and gene activation/silencing. Remarkably, in mammalian somatic cells, H3S10P initiates in the pericentromeric heterochromatin during the late G2 phase, and phosphorylation spreads throughout the chromosomes arms in prophase, being maintained until the onset of anaphase when it gets dephosphorylated. Considerable studies have been carried out about H3S10P in different organisms; however, there is little information about this histone modification in mammalian embryos. We hypothesized that this epigenetic modification could also be a marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin in preimplantation embryos. We therefore followed the H3S10P distribution pattern in the G1/S and G2 phases through the entire preimplantation development in in vivo mouse embryos. We paid special attention to its localization relative to another pericentromeric heterochromatin marker, HP1\u03b2 and performed immunoFISH using specific pericentromeric heterochromatin probes. Our results indicate that H3S10P presents a remarkable distribution pattern in preimplantation mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage and is a better marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin than HP1\u03b2. After the 8-cell stage, H3S10P kinetic is more similar to the somatic one, initiating during G2 in chromocenters and disappearing upon telophase. Based on these findings, we believe that H3S10P is a good marker of pericentromeric heterochromatin, especially in the late 1- and 2-cell stages as it labels both parental genomes and that it can be used to further investigate epigenetic regulation and heterochromatin mechanisms in early preimplantation embryos."

Multiciliated ependymal cells become fully differentiated at postnatal stages however they are specified during mid to late embryogenesis from a population of radial glial cells. Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1."

OBJECTIVE: We report a detailed description of a family affected by a hereditary multisystem disorder associated with moyamoya syndrome. METHODS: In this family case report, we evaluated 9 members of the same family originating from Algeria. Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17. RESULTS: Five males related through a maternal lineage were affected, suggesting an X-linked inheritance. Four of them had symptomatic moyamoya syndrome with an onset of acute neurologic manifestations between 4 and 32 years. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, azoospermia, short stature of postnatal onset (-2 to -4 SD in adulthood), premature graying of hair, and dysmorphism were present in all patients. The other features of the disease included early cataract in 4, dilated cardiomyopathy in 3, and partial growth hormone deficiency in 2 members. Muscle biopsy data did not reveal signs of a mitochondrial disorder. All conditions known to be associated with moyamoya syndrome such as Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and sickle cell disease were excluded. We also excluded linkage to the 2 loci previously reported to be involved in autosomal dominant syndromic and nonsyndromic moyamoya. Carrier females had normal phenotype and clinical history. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance."

For decades, the most severe, protracted and therapy-resistant forms of major depression have compelled clinicians and researchers to look for last resort treatment. Early psychosurgical procedures were hazardous and often associated with severe and persistent side effects including avolition, apathy and change of personality. With the introduction of psychopharmacological treatments in the 1950s, the frequency of ablative procedures declined rapidly. The past decade, however, has witnessed the resurgence of surgical strategies as a result of refined techniques and advances such as high frequency stimulation of deep brain nuclei. Recent data suggest that the overall effect of high frequency stimulation lies in the functional inhibition of neural activity in the region stimulated. Contrary to other psychosurgical procedures, high frequency stimulation reversibly modulates targeted brain areas and allows a postsurgical adaption of the stimulation parameters according to clinical outcome. With increased understanding of the brain regions and functional circuits involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, major depression has emerged as a target for new psychosurgical approaches to selectively and precisely modulate neural areas involved in the disease process. Recent studies of minimally intervening procedures report good clinical outcome in the treatment of therapy-resistant forms of major depression. High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas. Nevertheless, the reticence toward psychosurgery, even for those patients suffering from the most debilitating forms of depression, still prevails, even though recent studies have shown significant improvement in terms of quality of life with the limitation that the number of treated cases has been small. In any event, valid and unambiguous criteria for patient eligibility have yet to be refined and standardized. In this review, we suggest possible standard criteria for the application of deep brain stimulation on patients suffering from otherwise treatment-resistant depression."

Junctin and junctate are two important proteins involved in calcium regulation in eukaryotic cells. To understand the regulation of these two proteins, we identified and functionally characterized one of the two promoter sequences of the AbetaH-J-J locus. We demonstrate that the P2 promoter of the AbetaH-J-J locus contains (i) a minimal sequence localized within a region -159 bp from the transcription initiation site, which is sufficient to activate transcription of both mRNAs; (ii) sequences which bind known transcriptional factors such as those belonging to the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2), MEF-3, and NF-kappaB protein families; and (iii) sequences bound by unknown proteins. The functional characterization of the minimal promoter in C2C12 cells and in the rat soleus muscle in vivo model indicates the existence of cis elements having positive and negative effects on transcription. In addition, our data demonstrate that in striated muscle cells the calcium-dependent transcription factor MEF-2 is crucial for the transcription activity directed by the P2 promoter. The transcription directed by the AbetaH-J-J P2 promoter is induced by high expression of MEF-2, further stimulated by calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, and inhibited by histone deacetylase 4."

Despite considerable progress toward understanding the individual function of these protein kinases, how their activity is coordinated in space and time during mitosis is less well understood. In a recent article published in the Journal of Cell Biology, we show that CDK-1 regulates PLK-1 activity during mitosis in C. elegans embryos through multisite phosphorylation of the PLK-1 activator SPAT-1 (Aurora Borealis, Bora in human). SPAT-1 variants mutated on CDK-1 phosphorylation sites results in severe delays in mitotic entry, mimicking embryos lacking spat-1 or plk-1 function. We further show that SPAT-1 phosphorylation by CDK-1 promotes its binding to PLK-1 and stimulates PLK-1 phosphorylation on its activator T-loop by Aurora A kinase in vitro. Likewise, we find that phosphorylation of Bora by Cdk1 promotes phosphorylation of human Plk1 by Aurora A suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in humans. These results indicate that Cdk1 regulates Plk1 by boosting its kinase activity. Here we discuss these recent findings and open questions regarding the regulation of Plk1/PLK-1 by Cdk1/CDK-1 and Bora/SPAT-1."

Although the term, \"trichothiodystrophy\" (TTD) refers to the hair anomalies in this group of patients, this is a heterogeneous, multisystem disease in which any or every organ in the body may be affected. Neuroectodermal derived tissues are particularly likely to be involved. This term was introduced by Price et alin 1980 to designate patients with sulfur-deficient brittle hair, which they recognized as a marker for this complex disease and designated it as a \"neuroectodermal symptom complex\". Patients with TTD have brittle hair and nails (associated with reduced content ofcysteine-rich matrix proteins), ichthyotic skin and physical and mental growth retardation. Ichthyosis is usually apparent at birth but much less so after the first few weeks of life. Other frequently associated features include ocular cataracts, infections and maternal complications related to pregnancy. Atrophy of subcutaneous fat may also be present. TTD occurs in a pattern of inheritance consistent with an autosomal recessive condition. The disease is extremely heterogeneous in severity and extent, with some patients showing no neurological deficiency. Others show severe, multisystem disease. Many patients die at a young age, most commonly due to infectious disease. TTD is part of a more broadly defined group of diseases identified as IBIDS (ichthyosis, brittle hair, impaired intelligence, decreased fertility and short stature). Photosensitive cases are also identified as PIBIDS (photosensitivity with IBIDS). Cases without manifest ichthyosis are also identified as PBIDS. These syndromes defy rigorous definition because of clinical variation between patients. The original two cases were described by Tay in oriental siblings, whose parents were first cousins; thus the disease is also known as Tay syndrome. The hairs in patients with TTD have a distinctive, diagnostically useful appearance on polarized light microscopy consisting of alternating light and dark bands known as the \"tiger tail\" anomaly. Diagnosis may be confirmed by sulfur content analysis ofhair shafts, which shows decreased sulfur and cysteine content. Approximately half of patients with TTD have photosensitivity, which correlates with a nudeotide excision repair (NER) defect. These patients are designated as having trichothiodystrophy-photosensitive (TTDP). Non-photosensitivepatients are designated as having trichothiodystrophy-nonphotosensitive (TTDN). Skin cancer is very rare in sun-sensitive TTD."

These traits are controlled by neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.

We hypothesized that MAOA can have a potential role in ADHD associated CD/ODD and analyzed 24 markers in a group of Indo-Caucasoid subjects. ADHD probands and controls (N = 150 each) matched for ethnicity and gender were recruited following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV. Appropriate scales were used for measuring CD and ODD traits. Markers were genotyped by PCR-based methods and data obtained analyzed using the Cocaphase program under UNPHASED. Only eight markers were found to be polymorphic. rs6323 \"G\" allele showed higher frequencies in ADHD (P = 0.0023), ADHD + CD (P = 0.03) and ADHD + ODD (P = 0.01) as compared to controls. Haplotype analysis revealed statistically significant difference for three haplotypes in ADHD cases (P < 0.02). Statistically significant differences were also noticed for haplotypes in ADHD + CD and ADHD + ODD cases (P < 0.01). LD analysis showed significant variation in different groups. Multidimensionality reduction analysis showed independent as well as interactive effects of markers. Genotypes showed correlation with behavioral problems in ADHD and ADHD + CD.

OBJECTIVES: A comparative analysis of three major clinical trials with factor Xa inhibitor oral anticoagulant (XOAC) drugs versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation-Rocket-AF (rivaroxaban), Aristotle (apixaban) and Engage AF Timi 48 (edoxaban; two different doses and sets of data)-was carried out. METHODS: Data were extracted from the original reports (study level) and a meta-analysis was carried out. RESULTS: When compared with warfarin, XOAC therapy was associated with a decrease in haemorrhagic stroke, with a similar pattern for all regimens and meta-analysis showing a risk ratio of 0.488 (95% CI 0.396 to 0.601). Regarding total mortality, a favourable pattern was seen for all four regimens and meta-analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.892 (95% CI 0.840 to 0.947). Major bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding provided two examples regarding which heterogeneity would seem to exist, when XOAC drugs are compared with warfarin. In what concerns the incidence of myocardial infarction, the primary end point (stroke plus systemic embolism) and ischaemic stroke, the situation is less clear. These results are inconsistent with a putative 'group effect' for all the seven parameters under study, and for some of them it would probably be best to look at each of the individual trial data rather than at the meta-analysis data (which seem to lack a clear biological meaning). CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban have shown interesting effects, when compared with warfarin in clinical trials, in patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly with regard to haemorrhagic stroke and to the mortality rate. No other consistent conclusions concerning a putative 'group effect' can be reached at the present stage. Concerns regarding adherence to therapy, possible drug interactions, cost and current absence of antidotes may be taken into consideration when choosing an anticoagulant drug."

ROBs can be classified into two groups depending on their frequency of occurrence, common (rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q)), and rare (all remaining possible nonhomologous combinations). Herein, we have studied 29 case subjects of common and rare de novo ROBs to determine their parental origins and timing of formation. We compared these case subjects to 35 published case subjects of common ROBs and found that most common ROBs apparently have the same breakpoints and arise mainly during oogenesis (50/54). These probably form through a common mechanism and have been termed \"class 1.\" Collectively, rare ROBs also occur mostly during oogenesis (7/10) but probably arise through a more \"random\" mechanism or a variety of mechanisms and have been termed \"class 2.\" Thus, we demonstrate that although both classes of ROBs occur predominantly during meiosis, the common, class 1 ROBs occur primarily during oogenesis and likely form through a mechanism distinct from that forming class 2 ROBs."

Activated oncogenes induce compensatory tumour-suppressive responses, such as cellular senescence or apoptosis, but the signals determining the main outcome remain to be fully understood. Here, we uncover a role for Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) in suppressing Myc-induced senescence. Short-term activation of Myc promoted cell-cycle progression in either wild-type or Cdk2 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In the knockout MEFs, however, the initial hyper-proliferative response was followed by cellular senescence. Loss of Cdk2 also caused sensitization to Myc-induced senescence in pancreatic beta-cells or splenic B-cells in vivo, correlating with delayed lymphoma onset in the latter. Cdk2-/- MEFs also senesced upon ectopic Wnt signalling or, without an oncogene, upon oxygen-induced culture shock. Myc also causes senescence in cells lacking the DNA repair protein Wrn. However, unlike loss of Wrn, loss of Cdk2 did not enhance Myc-induced replication stress, implying that these proteins suppress senescence through different routes. In MEFs, Myc-induced senescence was genetically dependent on the ARF-p53-p21Cip1 and p16INK4a-pRb pathways, p21Cip1 and p16INK4a being selectively induced in Cdk2-/- cells. Thus, although redundant for cell-cycle progression and development, Cdk2 has a unique role in suppressing oncogene- and/or stress-induced senescence. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk2 induced Myc-dependent senescence in various cell types, including a p53-null human cancer cell line. Our data warrant re-assessment of Cdk2 as a therapeutic target in Myc- or Wnt-driven tumours."

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal white matter visible by brain imaging.

We mapped tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH) to 10q22.3-23.1 in French-Canadian families and sequenced candidate genes within this interval. Two missense and one insertion mutations in five individuals with TACH were uncovered in POLR3A, which codes for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Because these families were mapped to the same locus as leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) and presented clinical and radiological overlap with individuals with hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome, we sequenced this gene in nine individuals with 4H and eight with LO. In total, 14 recessive mutations were found in 19 individuals with TACH, 4H, or LO, establishing that these leukodystrophies are allelic. No\u00a0individual was found to carry two nonsense mutations. Immunoblots on 4H fibroblasts and on the autopsied brain of an individual diagnosed with 4H documented a significant decrease in POLR3A levels, and there was a more significant decrease in the cerebral white\u00a0matter compared to that in the cortex. Pol III has a wide set of target RNA transcripts, including all nuclear-coded tRNA. We hypothesize that the decrease in POLR3A leads to dysregulation of the expression of certain Pol III targets and thereby perturbs cytoplasmic protein synthesis. This type of broad alteration in protein synthesis is predicted to occur in other leukoencephalopathies such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3, caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1)."

METHODS: After a placebo-controlled study, 38 patients with UC were randomized to a loading regimen of vedolizumab 2, 6, or 10 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 43, followed by maintenance dosing every 8 weeks. Thirty-four vedolizumab-naive patients (15 UC; 19 CD) were randomized to vedolizumab 2, 6, or 10 mg/kg on the same schedule. Rollover patients were treated up to 630 days and treatment-naive patients were treated up to 547 days. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were dosed; 52 (72%) completed the study. In exploratory analyses, 28 of 72 (39%; UC: 21 of 53, CD: 7 of 19) achieved clinical response and 42 of 72 (58.3%; UC: 38 of 53, CD: 4 of 19) achieved clinical remission.

Mean Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores decreased from 295 (baseline) to 238 at day 43, continued to trend downward through day 155, and remained below baseline through day 491. Mean Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores increased in all treatment groups. No deaths or systemic opportunistic infections were reported. CONCLUSION: Vedolizumab every 8 weeks for up to 78 weeks had an adverse event profile similar to that previously observed.

It is associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and decreased longevity. In managing obesity, diet and exercise are essential; pharmacological therapy may be added for obese patients or overweight patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Sibutramine is a serotonergic and adrenergic drug that reduces food intake and increases thermogenesis. It reduces bodyweight by about 4.2 kg after 12 months, and improves blood glucose and lipids; however, it can increase heart rate and blood pressure. In the SCOUT (Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes) study, sibutramine increased serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, compared with placebo, and was consequently withdrawn from the market. The lesson learnt from this is the importance of patient selection, limiting the duration of treatment and stopping treatment in non-responders. Currently, phentermine and amfepramone (diethylpropion) are approved for short-term treatment of obesity (up to 3 months) and orlistat is approved for longer-term treatment; however, the gastrointestinal adverse effects of orlistat may be intolerable for some patients.

In 1986, the French Adjuvant Study Group (FASG) began a randomised trial aimed to investigate the concept of dose intensity as well as the optimal duration of treatment in patients with early breast cancer. Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients were included in the trial, of whom 595 were evaluable. Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 3 cycles. Locoregional radiotherapy was administered after the third cycle of chemotherapy in all treatment arms. Clinical prognostic factors were similar between treatment groups. Approximately 62% of all patients had 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes; 50% of patients were hormone receptor positive and 73% were Scarff-Bloom Richardson (SBR) grade 2 to 3. Toxicity was evaluated in 595 patients (207, 193 and 195 patients in Groups A, B and C, respectively), who received a total of 2301 chemotherapy cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

High levels of circulating catecholamines have been established as fundamental pathophysiological elements of heart failure (HF). However, it is unclear whether the increased gene expression of catecholamine-synthesis enzymes in the adrenal glands contributes to these hormone abnormalities in large animal HF models. We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls. Pigs with severe HF demonstrated an increased expression of TH and DBH (but neither AAAD nor PNMT) as compared to animals with milder HF and controls (P<0.05 in all cases). The increased adrenal mRNA expression of TH and DBH was accompanied by a reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) (P<0.001) and an elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (P<0.01), the other indices reflecting HF severity. There was a positive relationship between the increased adrenal mRNA expression of TH and DBH, and the high levels of circulating adrenaline and noradrenaline (all P<0.05). The association with noradrenaline remained significant also when adjusted for LVEF and plasma BNP, suggesting a significant contribution of adrenals to the circulating pool of catecholamines in subjects with systolic HF."

Stimulating microbial reduction of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) shows promise as a strategy for immobilizing uranium in uranium-contaminated subsurface environments. In order to learn more about which microorganisms might be involved in U(VI) reduction in situ, the changes in the microbial community when U(VI) reduction was stimulated with the addition of acetate were monitored in sediments from three different uranium-contaminated sites in the floodplain of the San Juan River in Shiprock, N.Mex. In all three sediments U(VI) reduction was accompanied by concurrent Fe(III) reduction and a dramatic enrichment of microorganisms in the family Geobacteraceae, which are known U(VI)- and Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms. At the point when U(VI) reduction and Fe(III) reduction were nearing completion, Geobacteraceae accounted for ca. 40% of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences recovered from the sediments with bacterial PCR primers, whereas Geobacteraceae accounted for fewer than 5% of the 16S rDNA sequences in control sediments that were not amended with acetate and in which U(VI) and Fe(III) reduction were not stimulated. Between 55 and 65% of these Geobacteraceae sequences were most similar to sequences from Desulfuromonas species, with the remainder being most closely related to Geobacter species. Quantitative analysis of Geobacteraceae sequences with most-probable-number PCR and TaqMan analyses indicated that the number of Geobacteraceae sequences increased from 2 to 4 orders of magnitude over the course of U(VI) and Fe(III) reduction in the acetate-amended sediments from the three sites. No increase in Geobacteraceae sequences was observed in control sediments. In contrast to the predominance of Geobacteraceae sequences, no sequences related to other known Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms were detected in sediments. These results compare favorably with an increasing number of studies which have demonstrated that Geobacteraceae are important components of the microbial community in a diversity of subsurface environments in which Fe(III) reduction is an important process. The combination of these results with the finding that U(VI) reduction takes place during Fe(III) reduction and prior to sulfate reduction suggests that Geobacteraceae will be responsible for much of the Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction during uranium bioremediation in these sediments."

The test performance of this microarray was evaluated with 95 Enterobacteriaceae isolates suspected of being carbapenemase producers, i.e. with meropenem MICs > 0.5 mg l(-1). The collection of isolates contained 70 carbapenemase-producing isolates, including 37 bla(KPC)-, 20 bla(VIM)-, five bla(OXA-48)-, four bla(KPC)/bla(VIM)- and four bla(NDM)-positive isolates; and 25 carbapenemase-gene-negative isolates. ESBLs were produced by 51 of the isolates. PCR and sequencing of \u03b2-lactamase genes was used as reference test. For detection of carbapenemases, the sensitivity of the microarray was 97% (68/70), with 100% specificity. The two negative isolates tested positive when the microarray test was repeated; these isolates were an OXA-48- and a KPC-producing isolate. For ESBL detection, the sensitivity was 100% (51/51) and the specificity was 98% (43/44), although 20% of the SHV-12 ESBLs were categorized as SHV-2-like ESBLs. In conclusion, the CDT102 microarray is a rapid and accurate tool for the detection of carbapenemase and ESBL genes, although the array seems less suitable for epidemiology of ESBL genes."

BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas. METHODS: The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation. RESULTS: Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSIONS: People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles. The limitations of the principles in predicting ethical decision making are discussed."

OBJECTIVE: The present analysis evaluates the prevalence and medication use in inpatients with depression during childhood and adolescence at the KinderAGATE hospitals in 2010. Also discussed are age and sex distribution. METHOD: Since 2009 the following information has been recorded anonymously twice a year from each patient at the participating hospitals of KinderAGATE: age, sex, leading diagnosis, prescribed medication and dosage. The data obtained provide an excellent epidemiological basis for the observation of the prescription practice in child and adolescent psychiatry. RESULTS: In 2010, 8.4 % of the patients included were treated for a depressive disorder at the KinderAGATE hospitals. This is only a small portion compared to the rates found in adult psychiatry (25.8 % of patients). In our sample male patients diagnosed with depression (58 % DPat, mean age 13.8 years) were treated more often and earlier than female patients (42 % DPat, mean age 15.3 years). Fluoxetine and mirtazapine were the most frequently prescribed substances. Sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram were also prescribed. CONCLUSION: A reserved medical treatment can be observed in child and adolescence psychiatry. Off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. Moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only SSRI currently approved for this age group in Germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives."

The AzgA purine/H(+) symporter of Aspergillus nidulans is the founding member of a functionally and phylogenetically distinct transporter family present in fungi, bacteria and plants. Here a valid AzgA topological model is built based on the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli uracil transporter UraA, a member of the nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT/NCS2) family. The model consists of 14 transmembrane, mostly \u03b1-helical, segments (TMSs) and cytoplasmic N- and C-tails. A distinct compact core of 8 TMSs, made of two intertwined inverted repeats (TMSs 1-4 and 8-11), is topologically distinct from a flexible domain (TMSs 5-7 and 12-14). A putative substrate binding cavity is visible between the core and the gate domains. Substrate docking, molecular dynamics and mutational analysis identified several residues critical for purine binding and/or transport in TMS3, TMS8 and TMS10. Among these, Asn131 (TMS3), Asp339 (TMS8) and Glu394 (TMS10) are proposed to directly interact with substrates, while Asp342 (TMS8) might be involved in subsequent substrate translocation, through H(+) binding and symport. Thus, AzgA and other NAT transporters use topologically similar TMSs and amino acid residues for substrate binding and transport, which in turn implies that AzgA-like proteins constitute a distant subgroup of the ubiquitous NAT family."

Junctin is a transmembrane protein of the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin 1. This quaternary protein complex is thought to facilitate SR Ca2+ release. To improve our understanding of the contribution of junctin to the regulation of SR function, we examined the age-dependent effects of junctin overexpression in the atrium of 3-, 6-, and 18-wk-old transgenic mice. The ratio of atrial weight and body weight was unchanged between junctin-overexpressing (JCN) and wild-type (WT) mice at all ages investigated (n=6-8). The protein expression of triadin 1 was decreased starting in 3-wk-old JCN atria (by 69%), whereas the expression of the ryanodine receptor was diminished in 6- (by 48%) and 18-wk-old (by 57%) JCN atria compared with age-matched WT atria. Force of contraction was decreased by 35% in 18-wk-old JCN compared with age-matched WT left atrial muscle strips, which was accompanied by a prolonged time of relaxation (48.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 44.2 +/- 0.8 ms, respectively, n=6-8, P <0.05). The spontaneous beating rate of isolated right atria was higher in 18-wk-old JCN mice compared with age-matched WT mice (389 +/- 10 vs. 357 +/- 6 beats/min, respectively, n=6-8, P <0.05). Heart rate was lower by 9% in telemetric ECG recordings in 18-wk-old JCN mice during stress tests. Three-week-old JCN atria exhibited a higher potentiation of force of contraction at rest pauses of 30 s (by 13%) and of 300 s (by 35%), suggesting increased SR Ca2+ content. This was consistent with the higher force of contraction in 3-wk-old JCN atria (by 29%) compared with age-matched WT atria (by 10%) under the administration of caffeine. We conclude that in 3-wk-old atria, junctin overexpression was associated with a reduced expression of triadin 1 resulting in a higher SR Ca2+ load without changes in contractility or heart rate. In 6-wk-old JCN atria, the compensatory downregulation of the ryanodine receptor may offset the effects of junctin overexpression. Finally, the progressive decrease in ryanodine receptor density may contribute to the decreased atrial contractility and lower heart rate during stress in 18-wk-old JCN mice."

Functional polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites consist of two sequence elements, the AAUAAA and G/U box signals, that closely flank the site of mRNA 3'-end formation. In agreement with previous results, random sequence insertions between the AAUAAA and G/U box signals were observed to inhibit poly(A) site function. However, sequence insertions of similar size that were predicted to form RNA stem-loop structures were found to have little effect on the efficiency of polyadenylation and instead induced a 3' shift in the site of polyadenylation that was equal to the length of the inserted stem-loop. The in vivo utilization of a poly(A) site bearing an internal RNA stem-loop structure was inhibited by mutations that destabilized the predicted stem but was restored by compensatory mutations. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the appropriate spacing of the AAUAAA and G/U box signals is critical for poly(A) site function. Sequence insertions that are able to form RNA secondary structures that maintain the correct spacing of these two RNA target sequences are well tolerated, whereas sequence insertions that disturb this spacing inhibit poly(A) site recognition. It is proposed that the effect of sequence insertions on poly(A) site function may be sufficiently predictable to allow the development of an assay for in vivo RNA secondary structure that uses poly(A) site selection as a readout."

The isolation and analysis of nucleated fetal cells (NFCs) from maternal blood may represent a new approach to noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. Although promising, these techniques require highly accurate separation of NFCs from nucleated cells of maternal origin; the two major problems limiting these techniques are the relative rarity of fetal cells in maternal blood and the need to establish their fetal origin. We now report a novel procedure that has allowed accurate separation of NFCs from maternal cells. The technique reported involves direct micromanipulator isolation of histochemically identified hemoglobin F-positive nucleated cells to obtain fetal nucleated red blood cells (FNRBCs) of high yield and purity. Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis. The procedure used, which can be completed in <72 hrs, produced complete concordance with the results of amniocentesis. We also confirm findings of prior studies suggesting that the number of FNRBCs in maternal circulation is remarkably higher in abnormal pregnancies than in normal pregnancies, especially in women carrying a fetus with trisomy 21."

INTRODUCTION: Koebner phenomenon in psoriasis presents development of psoriatic lesions, after injury of uninvolved skin, which are identical in morphology with the previous trauma. The aim of this study was to establish the correlation of Koebner phenomenon with sex and age distribution, clinical variants of psoriasis vulgaris, age of onset and incidence in psoriasis among relatives of affected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty patients, with severe clinical picture, participated in this study: 38 patients in acute flare of a chronic form; 10 with acute exanthematic form; 8 with a chronic stable form; 3 with psoriatic changes on palms and soles and one patient with psoriatic erythroderma. According to the presence of Koebner phenomenon they were divided in two groups, one with positive and the other with negative Koebner phenomenon which presented the control group at the same time. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Koebner reaction is often thought to be more frequent in actively spreading, severe psoriasis. Although this may be true, it has to be established by prospective studies. According to our investigation, Koebner phenomenon did not depend on clinical picture of psoriasis vulgaris. This reaction also appears to be a marker for a subgroup of patients with a tendency to early onset, but that was not confirmed by our study. In available literature we did not find any data about relations of Koebner phenomenon to sex and age or familiar incidence of psoriasis vulgaris. Our results demonstrated no connection of Koebner phenomenon with sex and age structure. At the same time its presence did not depend on familiar incidence of psoriasis vulgaris. CONCLUSIONS: There is no relationship between Koebner phenomenon and sex and age distribution. It does not depend on clinical picture and also does not predict the age of onset and familiar incidence of psoriasis vulgaris."

To localize the chAB4 sequences more precisely on the acrocentrics, chAB4-specific probes together with rDNA and a number of satellite sequences were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of normal probands and of carriers of Robertsonian translocations of the frequent types rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q). The results demonstrate that chAB4 is located on both sides of the rDNA on all the acrocentrics; the exact location, however, may be chromosome specific.

Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be reduced by over-expression of the Cterminally deleted Raptor mutant (Raptor-\u0394CT) not binding to mTOR or LST8, while phosphorylation levels of Akt were markedly enhanced with no alteration in IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity. Using Raptor-\u0394CT, we investigated the competition for association with LST8 between mTORC1 and mTORC2. Over-expression of Raptor-\u0394CT abolished formation of the Raptor, S6 kinase, mTOR and LST8 complex, while the amount of LST8 in the Rictor-mTOR complex was increased. Therefore, it is likely that Raptor-mTOR and Rictor-mTOR complexes compete for association with LST8, and this mechanism may contribute to the reciprocal negative regulations of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, in terms of their LST8 components.:"

Here we review recent findings concerning the expressional regulations and the proposed functions of junctin and junctate."

We and others previously showed that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is indispensable for myogenic differentiation. However, it is less clear which of the four p38 isoforms in the mouse genome participates in this process. Using C2C12 myogenic cells as a model, we showed here that p38alpha, beta, and gamma are expressed with distinct expression patterns during differentiation. Knockdown of any of them by small interfering RNA inhibits myogenic differentiation, which suggests that the functions of the three p38 isoforms are not completely redundant. To further elucidate the unique role of each p38 isoform in myogenic differentiation, we individually knocked down one p38 isoform at a time in C2C12 cells, and we compared the whole-genome gene expression profiles by microarrays. We found that some genes are coregulated by all three p38 isoforms, whereas others are uniquely regulated by one particular p38 isoform. Furthermore, several novel p38 target genes (i.e., E2F2, cyclin D3, and WISP1) are found to be required for myogenin expression, which provides a molecular basis to explain why different p38 isoforms are required for myogenic differentiation."

METHODS: The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (N = 3,753) is a population-based study of age-related hearing loss in adults aged 48 to 92 years in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. As part of this study, infectious disease history was obtained and hearing was tested using pure-tone audiometry. Hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average of thresholds at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 2,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz greater than 25 decibels hearing level in either ear. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, only a history of diphtheria (n = 37) was associated with hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 7.36). There was no relationship between hearing loss and history of chickenpox, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rheumatic fever, rubella, or scarlet fever. Only two participants with a history of diphtheria and hearing loss reported having a hearing loss before age 20. CONCLUSIONS: Diphtheria in childhood may have consequences for hearing that do not become apparent until later in life. A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway. These data may have important implications for areas facing a resurgence of diphtheria cases."

Conversely, the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 is critical for the incorporation of the Nup107/160 complex into new assembly sites specifically during interphase. Strikingly, recruitment of the Nup107/160 complex to an intact NE involves a membrane curvature-sensing domain of its constituent Nup133, which is not required for postmitotic NPC formation. Our results suggest that in organisms with open mitosis, NPCs assemble via two distinct mechanisms to accommodate cell cycle-dependent differences in NE topology."

Growth cones at the distal tips of growing nerve axons contain bundles of actin filaments distributed throughout the lamellipodium and that project into filopodia. The regulation of actin bundling by specific actin binding proteins is likely to play an important role in many growth cone behaviors. Although the actin binding protein, fascin, has been localized in growth cones, little information is available on its functional significance. We used the large growth cones of the snail Helisoma to determine whether fascin was involved in temporal changes in actin filaments during growth cone morphogenesis. Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia. Using a fascin antibody and a GFP fascin construct, we found that fascin incorporated into actin bundles from the beginning of growth cone formation at the cut end of axons. Fascin associated with most of the actin bundle except the proximal 6--12% adjacent to the central domain, which is the region associated with actin disassembly. Later, during growth cone morphogenesis when actin ribs shortened, the proximal fascin-free zone of bundles increased, but fascin was retained in the distal, filopodial portion of bundles. Treatment with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which phosphorylates fascin and decreases its affinity for actin, resulted in loss of all actin bundles from growth cones. Our findings suggest that fascin may be particularly important for the linear structure and dynamics of filopodia and for lamellipodial rib dynamics by regulating filament organization in bundles."

PURPOSE: Bladder cancer is potentially curable in the majority of cases; however, the prognosis for patients with advanced disease at presentation remains poor. Current noninvasive tests such as cytology lack sufficient sensitivity to detect low-grade, low-stage tumors. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as p16(INK4a), VHL, and the mismatch repair gene hMLH1, has established promoter hypermethylation as a common mechanism for tumor suppressor inactivation in human cancers. It is also a promising new target for molecular detection in bodily fluids including urine, a readily accessible fluid known to contain bladder cancer cells. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) can determine the presence or absence of methylation of a gene locus at a sensitivity level of up to 1 methylated allele in 1000 unmethylated alleles, appropriate for identifying cancer cell DNA in a bodily fluid. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first determined the frequency of hypermethylation of the Rb tumor suppressor gene by bisulfite sequencing and of the p16(INK4a), p14(ARF), APC, and RASSF1A tumor suppressor genes by MSP in 45 bladder cancers. We then designed a panel optimal for diagnostic coverage composed of the APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF) tumor suppressor genes. This panel was tested for detection of hypermethylation in matched sediment DNA from urine specimens obtained before surgery from the same 45 bladder cancer patients (2 Tis, 16 Ta, 10 T1, and 17 T2-4) as well as normal and benign control DNAs. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage). We detected gene hypermethylation in the matched urine DNA from 39 of 45 patients (87% sensitivity), including 16 cases that had negative cytology. No hypermethylation of APC, RASSF1A, or p14(ARF) was observed in normal transitional cell DNAs or in urine DNAs from normal healthy individuals and patients with inflammatory urinary disease (cystitis). Furthermore, an unmethylated gene in the tumor DNA was always found to be unmethylated in the matched urine DNA (100% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is common in bladder cancer and was found in all grades and stages of tumors examined. Hypermethylation was detected in the urine DNA from 39 of 45 (87%) patients, including cases of early-stage disease amenable to cure. MSP may enhance early detection of bladder cancer using a noninvasive urine test."

Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition with radial aplasia/hypoplasia and craniosynostosis (OMIM 218600). Of >20 cases reported so far, a few appear atypical and have been reassigned to other nosologic entities, including Fanconi anaemia, Roberts SC phocomelia, and Pfeiffer syndromes after demonstration of corresponding cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities. Clinical overlap between BGS, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), and RAPADILINO syndrome is noticeable. Because patients with RAPADILINO syndrome and a subset of patients with RTS have RECQL4 mutations, we reassessed two previously reported BGS families and found causal mutations in RECQL4 in both. In the first family, four affected offspring had craniosynostosis and radial defect and one of them developed poikiloderma. In this family, compound heterozygosity for a R1021W missense mutation and a g.2886delT frameshift mutation of exon 9 was found. In the second family, the affected male had craniosynostosis, radial ray defect, poikiloderma, and short stature. He had a homozygous splice site mutation (IVS17-2A>C). In both families, the affected offspring had craniosynostosis, radial defects, and growth retardation, and two developed poikiloderma. Our results confirm that BGS in a subgroup of patients is due to RECQL4 mutations and could be integrated into a clinical spectrum that encompasses RTS and RAPADILINO syndrome."

During a study of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in Bulgaria, a previously unrecognized neurological disorder was encountered, mainly in Wallachian Gypsies, who represent a relatively recent genetic isolate. The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features. Fifty individuals from 19 extended pedigrees were identified and examined clinically and electrophysiologically. At least 1 patient from each family was admitted to the hospital in Sofia for full investigation. Pedigree analysis indicates autosomal recessive inheritance. The disorder is recognized in infancy by the presence of congenital cataracts and microcorneas. A predominantly motor neuropathy beginning in the lower limbs and later affecting the upper limbs develops during childhood and leads to severe disability by the third decade. Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some. Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy, confirmed by nerve biopsy. The CCFDN syndrome is thus a pleomorphic autosomal recessive disorder displaying a combination of neurological and nonneurological features."

We have previously described ETV5 transcription factor associated with myometrial infiltration in human ECs. In this work, we further investigated ETV5 orchestrating downstream effects to confer the tumor the invasive capabilities needed to disseminate in the early stages of EC dissemination. Molecular profiling evidenced ETV5 having a direct role on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In particular, ETV5 modulated Zeb1 expression and E-Cadherin repression leading to a complete reorganization of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts. ETV5-promoted EMT resulted in the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in endometrial cell lines. Furthermore, we identified the lipoma-preferred partner protein as a regulatory partner of ETV5, acting as a sensor for extracellular signals promoting tumor invasion. All together, we propose ETV5-transcriptional regulation of the EMT process through a crosstalk with the tumor surrounding microenvironment, as a principal event initiating EC invasion."

BACKGROUND: In this prospective cohort study, we have undertaken a comprehensive evaluation of clinical parameters along with variation in 29 genes (including CYP2C9 and VKORC1) to identify factors determining interindividual variability in warfarin response. METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=311) were followed up prospectively for 26 weeks. Several outcomes chosen to capture both warfarin efficacy and toxicity were assessed. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were undertaken to assess the combined effect of clinical and genetic factors. RESULTS: CYP2C9 was the most important gene determining initial anticoagulant control, whereas VKORC1 was more important for stable anticoagulation. Novel associations with some clinical outcomes were found with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytochrome 450 genes CYP2C18 and CYP2C19, which were independent of the associations observed with CYP2C9 and in genes encoding CYP3A5, protein S and clotting factor V, although the variability explained by these genes was small. On the basis of the results of microcosting, adverse events were shown to be a significant predictor of total cost. CONCLUSION: Accurate prediction of warfarin dose requirement needs to take into account multiple genetic and environmental factors, the contributions of which vary in the induction and maintenance phases of treatment."

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B."

Kir6.2 is expressed in muscle, neuron and brain as well as the pancreatic beta-cell, so patients with KCNJ11 mutations could have a neurological phenotype in addition to their diabetes. It is proposed that some patients with KCNJ11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes (DEND), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes. We identified KCNJ11 mutations in four of 10 probands with permanent neonatal diabetes and one affected parent; this included the novel C166F mutation and the previously described V59M and R201H. Four of the five patients with mutations had neurological features: the patient with the C166F mutation had marked developmental delay, severe generalised epilepsy, hypotonia and muscle weakness; mild developmental delay was present in the patient with the V59M mutation; one patient with the R201H mutation had acute and chronic neurological consequences of cerebral oedema and another had diabetic neuropathy from chronic hyperglycaemia. In conclusion, the clinical features in these patients support the existence of a discrete neurological syndrome with KCNJ11 mutations. The severe DEND syndrome was seen with the novel C166F mutation and mild developmental delay with the V59M mutation. These features differ markedly from the neurological consequences of acute or chronic diabetes."

The mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS) is a conserved large hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, crucial for the maintenance of cristae morphology. MINOS has been suggested to represent the core of an extended protein network that controls mitochondrial function and structure, and has been linked to several human diseases. The spatial arrangement of MINOS within mitochondria is ill-defined, however. Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy, we determined the distribution of three known human MINOS subunits (mitofilin, MINOS1, and CHCHD3) in mammalian cells. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that all three subunits form similar clusters within mitochondria, and that MINOS is more abundant in mitochondria around the nucleus than in peripheral mitochondria. At the submitochondrial level, mitofilin, a core MINOS subunit, is preferentially localized at cristae junctions. In primary human fibroblasts, mitofilin labeling uncovered a regularly spaced pattern of clusters arranged in parallel to the cell growth surfaces. We suggest that this array of MINOS complexes might explain the observed phenomenon of largely horizontally arranged cristae junctions that connect the inner boundary membrane to lamellar cristae. The super-resolution images demonstrate an unexpectedly high level of regularity in the nanoscale distribution of the MINOS complex in human mitochondria, supporting an integrating role of MINOS in the structural organization of the organelle."

BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A disease (CMT1A) is a rare orphan inherited neuropathy caused by an autosomal dominant duplication of a gene encoding for the structural myelin protein PMP22, which induces abnormal Schwann cell differentiation and dysmyelination, eventually leading to axonal suffering then loss and muscle wasting. We favour the idea that diseases can be more efficiently treated when targeting multiple disease-relevant pathways. In CMT1A patients, we therefore tested the potential of PXT3003, a low-dose combination of three already approved compounds (baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol). Our study conceptually builds on preclinical experiments highlighting a pleiotropic mechanism of action that includes downregulation of PMP22. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of PXT3003. The secondary objective aimed at an exploratory analysis of efficacy of PXT3003 in CMT1A, to be used for designing next clinical development stages (Phase 2b/3). METHODS: 80 adult patients with mild-to-moderate CMT1A received in double-blind for 1 year Placebo or one of the three increasing doses of PXT3003 tested, in four equal groups. Safety and tolerability were assessed with the incidence of related adverse events. Efficacy was assessed using the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) and the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) as main endpoints, as well as various clinical and electrophysiological outcomes. RESULTS: This trial confirmed the safety and tolerability of PXT3003. The highest dose (HD) showed consistent evidence of improvement beyond stabilization. CMTNS and ONLS, with a significant improvement of respectively of 8% (0.4% - 16.2%) and 12.1% (2% - 23.2%) in the HD group versus the pool of all other groups, appear to be the most sensitive clinical endpoints to treatment despite their quasi-stability over one year under Placebo. Patients who did not deteriorate over one year were significantly more frequent in the HD group. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that PXT3003 deserves further investigation in adults and could greatly benefit CMT1A-diagnosed children, usually less affected than adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2010-023097-40. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01401257. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products issued in February 2014 a positive opinion on the application for orphan designation for PXT3003 (EMA/OD/193/13)."

It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Children with NF1 are at high risk of harboring numerous lesions that may require the attention of a neurosurgeon. Some of these include optic nerve gliomas, hydrocephalus, intraspinal tumors, and peripheral nerve tumors. Although most of the neoplasms that affect the brain, spine, and peripheral nerves of children are low-grade lesions, there is a small but real risk that some of these lesions may become high grade over time, requiring other forms of therapy than surgery alone. Other associated disorders that may result from NF1 in childhood include Chiari malformation Type I, scoliosis, and pulsating exophthalmos from the absence of the sphenoid wing. In this review, the major lesions that are found in children with NF1 are reviewed as well as the types of treatment that are offered by neurosurgeons and other members of the treating team. Today, optimum care of the child with NF1 is provided by a multidisciplinary team comprising neurosurgeons, neurologists, ophthalmologists, radiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and plastic surgeons."

Mature rod photoreceptor cells contain very small nuclei with tightly condensed heterochromatin. We observed that during mouse rod maturation, the nucleosomal repeat length increases from 190 bp at postnatal day 1 to 206 bp in the adult retina. At the same time, the total level of linker histone H1 increased reaching the ratio of 1.3 molecules of total H1 per nucleosome, mostly via a dramatic increase in H1c. Genetic elimination of the histone H1c gene is functionally compensated by other histone variants. However, retinas in H1c/H1e/H1(0) triple knock-outs have photoreceptors with bigger nuclei, decreased heterochromatin area, and notable morphological changes suggesting that the process of chromatin condensation and rod cell structural integrity are partly impaired. In triple knock-outs, nuclear chromatin exposed several epigenetic histone modification marks masked in the wild type chromatin. Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus. During retina development, the H1c gene and its promoter acquired epigenetic patterns typical of rod-specific genes. Our data suggest that histone H1c gene expression is developmentally up-regulated to promote facultative heterochromatin in mature rod photoreceptors."

In the carriers of 15/21 translocation, the number of large associations (involving more than two acrocentrics) and the association frequencies for individual acrocentric chromosomes, were significantly higher than in the control group. The mean number of associations of the single homologs of the translocation chromosomes was much higher than that of the other acrocentrics. In the carriers of 13/14 translocations, only the association frequency for chromosome 13 was higher than in the normal relatives. The uninvolved chromosomes homologous to those involved in translocation showed an insignificant increase in associations in comparison with the other acrocentrics. These results suggest that some mechanism within the cells compensates for the effect of missing acrocentrics or of acrocentrics lacking NORs on the number of associations. The possible relations of this phenomenon to the activity of the nucleolus organizing regions are discussed."

BACKGROUND: In the ARISTOTLE trial, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have a high risk of stroke. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in prespecified subgroups of patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. METHODS: Between Dec 19, 2006, and April 2, 2010, patients were enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial at 1034 clinical sites in 39 countries. 18,201 patients with AF or atrial flutter were randomly assigned to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2\u00b70-3\u00b70). The median duration of follow-up was 1\u00b78 years (IQR 1\u00b74-2\u00b73). The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, analysed by intention to treat. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding in the on-treatment population. All participants, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignments. In this subgroup analysis, we estimated event rates and used Cox models to compare outcomes in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. The ARISTOTLE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC00412984. FINDINGS: Of the trial population, 3436 (19%) had a previous stroke or TIA. In the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 2\u00b746 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the apixaban group and 3\u00b724 in the warfarin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b776, 95% CI 0\u00b756 to 1\u00b703); in the subgroup of patients without previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1\u00b701 per 100 patient-years of follow-up with apixaban and 1\u00b723 with warfarin (HR 0\u00b782, 95% CI 0\u00b765 to 1\u00b703; p for interaction=0\u00b771). The absolute reduction in the rate of stroke and systemic embolism with apixaban versus warfarin was 0\u00b777 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI -0\u00b708 to 1\u00b763) in patients with and 0\u00b722 (-0\u00b703 to 0\u00b747) in those without previous stroke or TIA. The difference in major bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin was 1\u00b707 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0\u00b709-2\u00b704) in patients with and 0\u00b793 (0\u00b754-1\u00b732) in those without previous stroke or TIA. INTERPRETATION: The effects of apixaban versus warfarin were consistent in patients with AF with and without previous stroke or TIA. Owing to the higher risk of these outcomes in patients with previous stroke or TIA, the absolute benefits of apixaban might be greater in this population. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer."

With this in mind, it is remarkable that mutations in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1), which is the most ubiquitously expressed gene of the three PRS genes, are compatible with life. Mutations described thus far in PRPS1 are all missense mutations that result in PRS-I superactivity or in variable levels of decreased activity, resulting in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 (CMTX5), Arts syndrome, and X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2). Patients with PRS-I superactivity primarily present with uric acid overproduction, mental retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, and hearing impairment. Postlingual progressive hearing loss is found as an isolated feature in DFN2 patients. Patients with CMTX5 and Arts syndrome have peripheral neuropathy, including hearing impairment and optic atrophy. However, patients with Arts syndrome are more severely affected because they also have central neuropathy and an impaired immune system. The neurological phenotype in all four PRPS1-related disorders seems to result primarily from reduced levels of GTP and possibly other purine nucleotides including ATP, suggesting that these disorders belong to the same disease spectrum. Preliminary results of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation in two Arts syndrome patients show improvement of their condition, indicating that SAM supplementation in the diet could alleviate some of the symptoms of patients with PRPS1 spectrum diseases by replenishing purine nucleotides (J.C., unpublished data)."

To identify specific functions for the NMD factors, we analyzed the mRNA decay phenotypes of yeast strains containing deletions of DCP1 or XRN1 and UPF1, NMD2, or UPF3. Our results indicate that Upf1p, Nmd2p, and Upf3p regulate decapping and exonucleolytic degradation of nonsense-containing mRNAs.

Duplication of the gene encoding the peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa (PMP22) underlies the most common inherited neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A (CMT1A), a disease without a known cure. Although demyelination represents a characteristic feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the degree of axonal loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and impaired sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of life, and walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological abnormalities are already present in childhood. Here, we show in Pmp22-transgenic rodent models of CMT1A that Schwann cells acquire a persistent differentiation defect during early postnatal development, caused by imbalanced activity of the PI3K-Akt and the Mek-Erk signaling pathways. We demonstrate that enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling by axonally overexpressed neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type I drives diseased Schwann cells toward differentiation and preserves peripheral nerve axons. Notably, in a preclinical experimental therapy using a CMT1A rat model, when treatment is restricted to early postnatal development, soluble NRG1 effectively overcomes impaired peripheral nerve development and restores axon survival into adulthood. Our findings suggest a model in which Schwann cell differentiation within a limited time window is crucial for the long-term maintenance of axonal support."

Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors block the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, increase its plasma half-life, and enhance its brain availability. Two COMT inhibitors, tolcapone and entacapone, have recently been made available as adjunctive agents to levodopa. In PD patients with motor fluctuations, they have been shown to increase \"on\" time and reduce \"off\" time. In patients with more advanced disease, they provide similar benefits, but patients tend to experience less overall benefit and a greater likelihood of developing dopaminergic adverse events. Accordingly, closer monitoring is required. In stable patients who have not yet developed motor complications, there are preliminary data suggesting that they experience improvements in motor function and in activities of daily living. Finally, there are theoretical reasons to consider administering a COMT inhibitor to patients from the onset of levodopa therapy in order to reduce the likelihood that motor complications will develop. COMT inhibitors are easy to administer, do not require titration, and are generally well tolerated particularly in patients with relatively mild disease. Adverse events are primarily dopaminergic and can usually be controlled by levodopa dose adjustments. COMT inhibitors have thus proven to be a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium of PD."

The median OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 8.0 (6.6-9.1) months for dovitinib and 8.4 (5.4-11.3) months for sorafenib. The median TTP (95% CI) per investigator assessment was 4.1 (2.8-4.2) months and 4.1 (2.8-4.3) months for dovitinib and sorafenib, respectively. Common any-cause adverse events included diarrhea (62%), decreased appetite (43%), nausea (41%), vomiting (41%), fatigue (35%), rash (34%), and pyrexia (30%) for dovitinib and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (66%) and decreased appetite (31%) for sorafenib. Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly higher median OS for patients in the dovitinib arm who had baseline plasma soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) below median levels versus at or above the median levels (median OS [95% CI]: sVEGFR1, 11.2 [9.0-13.8] and 5.7 [4.3-7.0] months, respectively [P = .0002]; HGF, 11.2 [8.9-13.8] and 5.9 [5.0-7.6] months, respectively [P = 0.0002]). CONCLUSION: Dovitinib was well tolerated, but activity was not greater than sorafenib as a frontline systemic therapy for HCC. Based on these data, no subsequent phase 3 study has been planned.

BACKGROUND: Methods to assess impaired consciousness in acute stroke typically include the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), but the verbal component has limitations in aphasic or intubated patients. The FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score, a new coma scale, evaluates 4 components: eye and motor responses, brainstem reflexes and respiration. We aimed to study the interobserver variability of the FOUR score in acute stroke patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with acute stroke admitted from February to July 2008 to the stroke unit of our Neurology Department. Patients were evaluated by neurology residents and nurses using the FOUR score and the GCS. For both scales, we obtained paired and total weighted kappa values (Kw) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). NIH stroke scale was also recorded on admission. RESULTS: We obtained a total of 75 paired evaluations in 60 patients (41 cerebral infarctions, 15 cerebral hemorrhages and 4 transient ischemic attacks). Thirty-three (55%) patients were alert, 17 (28.3%) drowsy and 10 (16.7%) stuporous or comatose. The overall rater agreement was excellent in the FOUR score (Kw 0.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.97) with an ICC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96) and in the GCS (Kw 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98) with an ICC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.97). A good correlation was found between the FOUR score and the GCS (rho 0.83; p < 0.01) and between the FOUR score and the NIH stroke scale (rho -0.78; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FOUR score is a reliable scale for evaluating the level of consciousness in acute stroke patients, showing a good correlation with the GCS and the NIH stroke scale."

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in tumor progression where the underlying cellular changes associated with EMT have been identified in in vitro models and confirmed in a limited number of in vivo studies. ZEB1, which targets E-cadherin repression, is a transcriptional regulator that has been implicated in EMT, and is associated with uterine and colorectal cancers. Regulation of ZEB1 expression has been shown to involve different microRNAs (miRNAs), identifying a potential role for miRNA in EMT. In the present study we have identified novel expression of ZEB1 in bladder tumours and shown a role for ZEB1 in enhanced migration and invasion potential in in vitro assays. Confirmation of ZEB1 expression in bladder tumours was shown in tissue microarrays (TMAs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ZEB1 expression in bladder tumorigenesis and define a possible role for this transcription factor in urothelial carcinomas of the bladder (UCBs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-eight samples were assembled in 10 tissue microarrays (TMAs; 263 non-muscle-invasive Ta/T1/Tis, 295 muscle-invasive T2-T4). All tumours were transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and processed for immunohistochemistry to assess nuclear ZEB1 expression. Expression levels of ZEB1 were modulated in bladder carcinoma cell lines CUBIII or UM-UC-3 after forced expression or shRNA knockdown, respectively. Protein expression levels were determined using western blot analysis and transfectants were assessed for migration and invasion potential in standard in vitro assays. RESULTS: Nuclear ZEB1 expression was recorded in 22.8% of non-muscle-invasive UCBs and 21.7% of muscle-invasive UCBs, including 24.1% grade I/II and 21.1% grade III tumours, and absent in normal bladder mucosa. No significant correlation was observed for tumour stage and grade, nodal involvement, vascular invasion, metastasis and overall or cancer-specific survival. The introduction or knockdown of ZEB1 expression in bladder carcinoma cell lines showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasive potential, respectively. Changes in ZEB1 expression were accompanied by altered microRNA (miRNA) expression underlying events linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CONCLUSION: The results in the present study showed novel expression of ZEB1 in bladder cancer in the absence of a link to clinical variables of change, including metastasis and survival. However, in vitro assays showed enhanced or reduced migration and invasion after the introduction or reduction of ZEB1, respectively, in transfected bladder cell lines. Modulation in expression of ZEB1 was closely linked to changes in the miR-200 family along with alternative known prognostic indicators of bladder tumour progression."

PURPOSE: Preclinical and early clinical studies have demonstrated that initial therapy with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is more effective in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma than single-agent BRAF inhibitors. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in patients who had received prior BRAF inhibitor treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label phase I/II study, we evaluated the pharmacology, safety, and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib. Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45). RESULTS: In parts B and C, confirmed objective response rates (ORR) were 15% (95% CI, 4% to 35%) and 13% (95% CI, 5% to 27%), respectively; an additional 50% and 44% experienced stable disease > 8 weeks, respectively. In part C, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2 to 4), and median overall survival was 11.8 months (95% CI, 8 to 25) from cross-over. Patients who previously received dabrafenib > 6 months had superior outcomes with the combination compared with those treated < 6 months; median PFS was 3.9 (95% CI, 3 to 7) versus 1.8 months (95% CI, 2 to 4; hazard ratio, 0.49; P = .02), and ORR was 26% (95% CI, 10% to 48%) versus 0% (95% CI, 0% to 15%). CONCLUSION: Dabrafenib plus trametinib has modest clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma. This regimen may be a therapeutic strategy for patients who previously benefited from BRAF inhibitor monotherapy > 6 months but demonstrates minimal efficacy after rapid progression with BRAF inhibitor therapy."

To date, six patients with either missense mutations affecting the UBE3B HECT domain or truncating mutations have been described. Here, we report on the identification of homozygous or compound heterozygous UBE3B mutations in six additional patients from five unrelated families using either targeted UBE3B sequencing in individuals with suggestive facial dysmorphic features, or exome sequencing. Our results expand the clinical and mutational spectrum of the UBE3B-related disorder in several ways. First, we have identified UBE3B mutations in individuals who previously received distinct clinical diagnoses: two sibs with Toriello-Carey syndrome as well as the patient reported to have a \"new\" syndrome by Buntinx and Majewski in 1990. Second, we describe the adult phenotype and clinical variability of the syndrome. Third, we report on the first instance of homozygous missense alterations outside the HECT domain of UBE3B, observed in a patient with mildly dysmorphic facial features. We conclude that UBE3B mutations cause a clinically recognizable and possibly underdiagnosed syndrome characterized by distinct craniofacial features, hypotonia, failure to thrive, eye abnormalities, other congenital malformations, low cholesterol levels, and severe intellectual disability. We review the UBE3B-associated phenotypes, including forms that can mimick Toriello-Carey syndrome, and suggest the single designation \"Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome\"."

Here, we report a proteomics-based approach for simultaneously documenting the strain membership and microbial physiology of the dominant Geobacter community members during in situ acetate amendment of the U-contaminated Rifle, CO, aquifer. Three planktonic Geobacter-dominated samples were obtained from two wells down-gradient of acetate addition. Over 2,500 proteins from each of these samples were identified by matching liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry spectra to peptides predicted from seven isolate Geobacter genomes. Genome-specific peptides indicate early proliferation of multiple M21 and Geobacter bemidjiensis-like strains and later possible emergence of M21 and G. bemidjiensis-like strains more closely related to Geobacter lovleyi. Throughout biostimulation, the proteome is dominated by enzymes that convert acetate to acetyl-coenzyme A and pyruvate for central metabolism, while abundant peptides matching tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins and ATP synthase subunits were also detected, indicating the importance of energy generation during the period of rapid growth following the start of biostimulation. Evolving Geobacter strain composition may be linked to changes in protein abundance over the course of biostimulation and may reflect changes in metabolic functioning. Thus, metagenomics-independent community proteogenomics can be used to diagnose the status of the subsurface consortia upon which remediation biotechnology relies."

One hallmark of Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumors is the presence of the Ews/Fli-1 chimeric oncogene. Interestingly, infection of neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with Ews/Fli-1 switches the differentiation program of neuroblastomas to Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumors. Here we examined the status of cytoplasmically sequestered wt-p53 in neuroblastomas after stable expression of Ews/Fli-1. Immunofluorescence revealed that in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines, p53 went from a punctate-pattern of cytoplasmic sequestration to increased nuclear localization. Western blot analysis revealed that PARC was down-regulated in one neuroblastoma cell line but not expressed in the second. Therefore, decreased PARC expression could not fully account for relieving p53 sequestration in the neuroblastoma tumor cells. Neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines showed marked increases in p53 protein expression without transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, p53 was primarily phosphorylated, without activation of its downstream target p21(WAF1). Western blot analysis revealed that whereas MDM2 gene expression does not change, p14(ARF), a negative protein regulator of MDM2, increases. These observations suggest that the downstream p53 pathway may be inactivated as a result of abnormal p53. We also found that p53 has an extended half-life in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants despite the retention of a wild-type sequence in neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines. We then tested the p53 response pathway and observed that the neuroblastoma parent cells responded to genotoxic stress, whereas the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants did not. These results suggest that Ews/Fli-1 can directly abrogate the p53 pathway to promote tumorigenesis. These studies also provide additional insight into the relationship among the p53 pathway proteins."

We therefore set out to perform a proof of concept study to determine whether anesthesia and surgery can have different effects in male and female AD transgenic (Tg) mice, and in female AD Tg plus Cyclophilin D knockout (CypD KO) mice. The mice received an abdominal surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia (anesthesia/surgery). Fear Conditioning System (FCS) was used to assess the cognitive function. Hippocampal levels of synaptic marker postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SVP) were measured using western blot analysis. Here we showed that the anesthesia/surgery decreased the freezing time in context test of FCS at 7 days after the anesthesia/surgery in female, but not male, mice. The anesthesia/surgery reduced hippocampus levels of synaptic marker PSD-95 and SVP in female, but not male, mice. The anesthesia/surgery induced neither reduction in freezing time in FCS nor decreased hippocampus levels of PSD-95 and SVP in the AD Tg plus CypD KO mice. These data suggest that the anesthesia/surgery induced a sex-dependent cognitive impairment and reduction in hippocampus levels of synaptic markers in AD Tg mice, potentially via a mitochondria-associated mechanism. These findings could promote clinical investigations to determine whether female AD patients are more vulnerable to the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction."

This is the largest recorded series concerning conjoined twins; data were analyzed on 7,903,000 births monitored by the BDMP in the period 1970-1977. The analysis identified 81 sets of conjoined twins, for a crude incidence of 10.25 per million births. The most common types of conjoined twins were thoracoomphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%), and craniopagus (6%). Conjoined twins are more common among females than males, and in nonwhites than whites. No maternal age effect was found. There was no evidence of seasonal or temporal clustering of the cases. The large number of conjoined twins who had birth defects that are not obviously linked to the conjoining (particularly neural tube defects and orofacial clefts) may provide insights into the pathogenesis of birth defects resulting from disordered embryonic migration and fusion."

Specimens with discordant results were tested with massively parallel pyrosequencing (454). DNA blends with 5% mutant alleles were tested to assess detection rates. RESULTS: Invalid results were observed in 8/116 specimens (6\u00b79%) with Sanger, 10/116 (8\u00b76%) with ABI BRAF, and 0/232 (0%) with the cobas BRAF test. PPA was 97\u00b77% for V600E mutation for the cobas BRAF test and Sanger, and NPA was 95\u00b73%. For the cobas BRAF test and ABI BRAF, PPA was 71\u00b79% and NPA 83\u00b77%. For 16 cobas BRAF test-negative/ABI BRAF-positive specimens, 454 sequencing detected no codon 600 mutations in 12 and variant codon 600 mutations in four. For eight cobas BRAF test-positive/ABI BRAF-negative specimens, four were V600E and four V600K by 454 sequencing. Detection rates for 5% mutation blends were 100% for the cobas BRAF test, 33% for Sanger, and 21% for the ABI BRAF. Reproducibility of the cobas BRAF test was 111/116 (96%) between the two sites. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to evaluate potential companion diagnostic tests in external laboratories simultaneously to the pivotal clinical trial validation. The health authority approved assay had substantially better performance characteristics than the two other methods. The overall success of the cobas BRAF test is a proof of concept for future biomarker development."

Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute neurological disorder characterized by mental confusion, oculomotor dysfunction, and ataxia. It has been reported in individuals with alcohol dependence, hyperemesis gravidarum, and prolonged parenteral nutrition without vitamin supplementation. Here we present the case of a 13-year-old male patient with neuroblastoma and a history of poor oral intake and nausea for 3 months. After admission, he showed gait disturbances, nystagmus, and excessive dizziness; his mental state, however, indicated he was alert, which did not fit the classical triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy. A diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy was made only after brain magnetic resonance imaging and serum thiamine level analyses were performed. The patient's symptoms remained after 5 days of treatment with 100-mg thiamine once daily; thus, we increased the dosage to 500 mg 3 times daily, 1,500 mg per day. His symptoms then improved after 20 days of replacement therapy. This case report describes a pediatric patient who was promptly diagnosed with Wernicke's encephalopathy, despite only 2 suspicious symptoms, and who completely recovered after high doses of thiamine were given intravenously."

They are present in the form of specialized organs, such as the pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, and adrenal gland, or in the form of the diffuse neuroendocrine system in the respiratory and digestive tracts. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, yet they present certain unifying features. These include frequent hormonal overproduction that leads to specific symptoms and a typical immunohistochemical staining profile with chromogranin A and synaptophysin reactivity. Over the past decades, many neuroendocrine tumors have been described in the context of heritable tumor syndromes, and there exist several syndromes that are almost entirely composed of neuroendocrine tumors. Tumors occurring as part of these hereditary syndromes are characterized by specific genetic abnormalities that have helped our understanding of tumorigenesis, and they frequently appear at a young age. It is therefore important for the pediatric pathologist to be aware of specific histologic characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors in childhood and of their association with specific tumor syndromes. This may alert other clinicians to the possibility of multiple tumors in the patient or his family members. This review focuses on hereditary syndromes with neuroendocrine tumors, including multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, Carney complex, pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome, and familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma. In addition, several individual neuroendocrine tumors are described, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, gastroenteropancreatic tumors, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma, emphasizing specific histopathologic characteristics."

METHOD: Maternal serum concentrations of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), and unconjugated estriol (uE3) were measured weekly in 3895 women from the 15th to the 20th week of pregnancy. Population-specific likelihood ratios were determined and used to calculate the risk of fetal Down syndrome for each pregnancy. RESULTS: The median multiple of the median values for AFP, beta-hCG, and uE3 concentrations were 0.69, 2.10, and 0.67 for the affected pregnancies. The likelihood ratio for a positive result was 1:19. The detection and false-positive rates were 69.23% and 5.8%. CONCLUSION: These findings were consistent with reported data and therefore confirmed triple-marker serum screening as effective and suitable for prenatal care in Venezuela. Latin American governments and Health Agencies should recommend offering this screening method to all pregnant women."

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type I (the classical variety) is a dominantly inherited, genetically heterogeneous connective-tissue disorder. Mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes, which encode type V collagen, have been identified in several individuals. Most mutations affect either the triple-helical domain of the protein or the expression of one COL5A1 allele. We identified a novel splice-acceptor mutation (IVS4-2A-->G) in the N-propeptide-encoding region of COL5A1, in one patient with EDS type I. The outcome of this mutation was complex: In the major product, both exons 5 and 6 were skipped; other products included a small amount in which only exon 5 was skipped and an even smaller amount in which cryptic acceptor sites within exon 5 were used. All products were in frame. Pro-alpha1(V) chains with abnormal N-propeptides were secreted and were incorporated into extracellular matrix, and the mutation resulted in dramatic alterations in collagen fibril structure. The two-exon skip occurred in transcripts in which intron 5 was removed rapidly relative to introns 4 and 6, leaving a large (270 nt) composite exon that can be skipped in its entirety. The transcripts in which only exon 5 was skipped were derived from those in which intron 6 was removed prior to intron 5. The use of cryptic acceptor sites in exon 5 occurred in transcripts in which intron 4 was removed subsequent to introns 5 and 6. These findings suggest that the order of intron removal plays an important role in the outcome of splice-site mutations and provide a model that explains why multiple products derive from a mutation at a single splice site."

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate. BACKGROUND: Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI. However, TIMI grade 3 patency rates 90 min into thrombolysis of only 50% to 60% indicate an obvious need for improved thrombolytic regimens. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic simulations were performed to design a new rt-PA regimen. We aimed for a plateau tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) plasma level similar to that of the first plateau of the Neuhaus regimen. These aims were achieved with a 20-mg rt-PA intravenous (i.v.) bolus followed by an 80-mg i.v. infusion over 60 min (regimen A). This regimen was tested in a consecutive comparative trial in 80 patients versus 2.25 10(6) IU of streptokinase/60 min (B), and 70 mg (C) or 100 mg (D) of rt-PA over 90 min. Subsequently, a confirmation trial of regimen A in 254 consecutive patients was performed with angiographic assessment by independent investigators of patency at 90 min. RESULTS: The comparative phase of the trial yielded, respectively, TIMI grade 3 and total patency (TIMI grades 2 and 3) of 80% and 85% (regimen A), 35% and 50% (B), 50% and 55% (C) and 60% and 70% (D). In the confirmation phase of the trial, regimen A yielded 81.1% TIMI grade 3 and 87.0% total patency. At follow-up angiography 7 (4.1%) of 169 vessels had reoccluded. In-hospital mortality rate was 1.2%. Nadir levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-antiplasmin were 3.6 +/- 0.8 mg/ml, 60 +/- 21% and 42 +/- 16%, respectively (mean +/- SD). Fifty-seven patients (22.4%) suffered from bleeding; 3.5% needed blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate. These results are substantially better than those reported from all currently utilized regimens. Head to head comparison with established thrombolytic regimens in a large-scale randomized trial is warranted."

Tumor treating fields (TTFields) is a noninvasive, regional antimitotic treatment modality that has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma by the U.S. FDA and has a CE mark in Europe. TTFields therapy delivers low-intensity (1-3\u00a0V/cm), intermediate-frequency (100-300\u00a0kHz), alternating electric fields to the tumor using transducer arrays placed on the skin around the region of the body containing the tumor. TTFields therapy affects metaphase, by disrupting mitotic spindle formation, and anaphase, by dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents, resulting in apoptosis. TTFields therapy is frequency tuned to specific cancer cell types. The antimitotic effect of TTFields therapy has been demonstrated in multiple cell lines when the appropriate frequency was utilized. A phase III trial of TTFields monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients established that TTFields therapy is associated with minimal toxicity, better quality of life, and comparable efficacy to chemotherapy. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and ovarian and pancreatic cancers."

Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1, consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1 (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1, Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2, but further work is required to establish its role."

The human skin, constantly exposed to UV radiation, particularly the UVB and UVA components, is vulnerable to its various deleterious effects such as erythema, photoaging, immunosuppression and cancer. To counteract these and for the maintenance of genomic integrity, cells have developed several protective mechanisms including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The network of damage sensors, signal transducers, mediators, and various effector proteins is regulated through changes in gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, act as posttranscriptional regulators through binding to complementary sequences in the 3\u00b4-untranslated region of their target genes, resulting in either translational repression or target degradation. Recent studies show that miRNAs add an additional layer of complexity to the intricately controlled cellular responses to UV radiation. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of miRNAs in the regulation of the human skin response upon exposure to UV radiation."

FGFR inhibitors elicit antitumor effects directly on cancer cells, as well as indirectly through the blockade of paracrine signaling. The dual inhibition of FGF and CSF1 or VEGF signaling is expected to enhance the antitumor effects through the targeting of immune evasion and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR or CSF1R inhibitors) and immune checkpoint blockers (anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies) may be a promising choice for cancer patients. The inhibition of FGF19-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of liver toxicity, whereas the activation of FGF23-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of heart toxicity. Endocrine FGF signaling affects the pathophysiology of cancer patients who are prescribed FGFR inhibitors. Whole-genome sequencing is necessary for the detection of promoter/enhancer alterations of FGFR genes and rare alterations of other genes causing FGFR overexpression. To sustain the health care system in an aging society, a benefit-cost analysis should be performed with a focus on disease-free survival and the total medical cost before implementing genome-based precision medicine for cancer patients."

The mismatch repair system (MMR) recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases caused mainly by DNA polymerase, and contributes to the fidelity of DNA replication in living cells. In Escherichia coli, the MutHLS system is known to function in MMR, and homologues of MutS and MutL are widely conserved in almost all organisms. However, the MutH endonuclease has not been found in the majority of organisms. Such organisms, including Thermus thermophilus HB8, often possess the so-called MutS2 protein, which is highly homologous to MutS but contains an extra C-terminal stretch. To elucidate the function of MutS2, we overexpressed and purified T. thermophilus MutS2 (ttMutS2). ttMutS2 demonstrated the ability to bind double-stranded (ds) DNA, but, unlike ttMutS, ttMutS2 showed no specificity for mismatched duplexes. ttMutS2 ATPase activity was also detected and was stimulated by dsDNA. Our results also showed that ttMutS2 incises dsDNA. ttMutS2 incises not only oligo dsDNA but also plasmid DNA, suggesting that ttMutS2 possesses an endonuclease activity. At low concentrations, the incision activity was not retained, but was promoted by T. thermophilus MutL."

Lipolysis is an important metabolic pathway controlling energy homeostasis through degradation of triglycerides stored in lipid droplets and release of fatty acids. Lipid droplets of mammalian cells are coated with one or more members of the PAT protein family, which serve important functions in regulating lipolysis. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which PAT family members, perilipin A, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP), and LSDP5, control lipolysis catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a major lipase in adipocytes and several non-adipose cells. We applied fluorescence microscopic tools to analyze proteins in situ in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and anisotropy Forster resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data show that ADFP and LSDP5 exchange between lipid droplet and cytoplasmic pools, whereas perilipin A does not. Differences in protein mobility do not correlate with PAT protein-mediated control of lipolysis catalyzed by HSL or endogenous lipases. Forster resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that each of the three PAT proteins bind HSL through interaction of the lipase with amino acids within the highly conserved amino-terminal PAT-1 domain. ADFP and LSDP5 bind HSL under basal conditions, whereas phosphorylation of serine residues within three amino-terminal protein kinase A consensus sequences of perilipin A is required for HSL binding and maximal lipolysis. Finally, protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of HSL increases lipolysis in cells expressing ADFP or LSDP5; in contrast, phosphorylation of perilipin A exerts the major control over HSL-mediated lipolysis when perilipin is the main lipid droplet protein."

To determine the relative importance of TSH in white adipose tissue, we compared the adipose phenotypes of two distinct mouse models of hypothyroidism.

One model, thyroidectomized (THYx) mice, had a 100-fold increase in TSH and a normal TSH receptor (TSHR); in contrast, the other model, hyt/hyt mice, had a 120-fold elevation of TSH but a nonfunctional TSHR. Although both THYx and hyt/hyt mice were in a severe hypothyroid state, the epididymal fat (mg)/body wt (g) (F/B) ratio of THYx mice was much smaller than that of hyt/hyt mice (8.2 \u00b1 0.43 vs. 14.4 \u00b1 0.40, respectively, P < 0.001). The fat cell diameter in THYx mice was also smaller than that in hyt/hyt mice (79 \u00b1 2.8 vs. 105 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcm, respectively, P < 0.001), suggesting that TSH induced lipolysis in adipose tissues. When we transferred a functional mouse TSHR gene and a control plasmid into opposite sides of epididymal fat of hyt/hyt mice by plasmid injection combined with electroporation, fat weight of the TSHR side was decreased to 60% of that of the control side. Messenger RNA levels of hormone-sensitive lipase in epididymal fat containing the transferred TSHR gene were twofold higher than those in tissue from the control side. These results indicated that TSH worked as a lipolytic factor in white adipose tissues, especially in mice in a hypothyroid state."

BACKGROUND: Recent advances have enabled delivery of high-intensity focused ultrasound through the intact human cranium with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. This preliminary study investigates the use of transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for the treatment of essential tremor. METHODS: From February 2011 through December 2011, in an open-label, uncontrolled study, we used transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound to target the unilateral ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus in 15 patients with severe, medication-refractory essential tremor. We recorded all safety data and measured the effectiveness of tremor suppression using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor to calculate the total score (ranging from 0 to 160), hand subscore (primary outcome, ranging from 0 to 32), and disability subscore (ranging from 0 to 32), with higher scores indicating worse tremor. We assessed the patients' perceptions of treatment efficacy with the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (ranging from 0 to 100%, with higher scores indicating greater perceived disability). RESULTS: Thermal ablation of the thalamic target occurred in all patients. Adverse effects of the procedure included transient sensory, cerebellar, motor, and speech abnormalities, with persistent paresthesias in four patients. Scores for hand tremor improved from 20.4 at baseline to 5.2 at 12 months (P=0.001). Total tremor scores improved from 54.9 to 24.3 (P=0.001). Disability scores improved from 18.2 to 2.8 (P=0.001). Quality-of-life scores improved from 37% to 11% (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, essential tremor improved in 15 patients treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. Large, randomized, controlled trials will be required to assess the procedure's efficacy and safety. (Funded by the Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01304758.)."

Oncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in murine fibroblasts initiates a senescence-like cell cycle arrest that depends on the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway. To investigate whether p53 is sufficient to induce senescence, we introduced a conditional murine p53 allele (p53(val135)) into p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and examined cell proliferation and senescence in cells expressing p53, oncogenic Ras, or both gene products. Conditional p53 activation efficiently induced a reversible cell cycle arrest but was unable to induce features of senescence. In contrast, coexpression of oncogenic ras or activated mek1 with p53 enhanced both p53 levels and activity relative to that observed for p53 alone and produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest that displayed features of cellular senescence. p19(ARF) was required for this effect, since p53(-/-) ARF(-/-) double-null cells were unable to undergo senescence following coexpression of oncogenic Ras and p53. Although the levels of exogenous p53 achieved in ARF-null cells were relatively low, the stabilizing effects of p19(ARF) on p53 could not explain the cooperation between oncogenic Ras and p53 in promoting senescence. Hence, enforced p53 expression without oncogenic ras in p53(-/-) mdm2(-/-) double-null cells produced extremely high p53 levels but did not induce senescence. Taken together, our results indicate that oncogenic activation of the MAP kinase pathway in murine fibroblasts converts p53 into a senescence inducer through both quantitative and qualitative mechanisms."

This article reviews the pharmacological properties of intravenous infusions of vedolizumab and its clinical efficacy in adult patients with these diseases. In phase III clinical trials, patients with ulcerative colitis had significantly higher rates of clinical response and clinical remission when treated with vedolizumab than when receiving placebo at both 6 and 52\u00a0weeks. However, outcomes with vedolizumab in patients with Crohn's disease were mixed. In a study that evaluated both clinical remission rate and CDAI-100 response rate as primary endpoints, only the clinical remission rate at 6\u00a0weeks was significantly higher with vedolizumab than placebo. In another trial, there was no significant between-group difference in the clinical remission rate in TNF-antagonist failure patients at 6\u00a0weeks (primary endpoint), although there was a significant difference at 10\u00a0weeks. In the Crohn's disease study that included maintenance treatment, vedolizumab was significantly more effective at 52\u00a0weeks than placebo in both endpoints (clinical remission was the only primary endpoint in the maintenance study). Vedolizumab was generally well tolerated in these trials. As vedolizumab is a specific \u03b14\u03b27 integrin antagonist, with gut-specific effects, it is unlikely to be associated with the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a risk observed with the less selective \u03b14\u03b27/\u03b14\u03b21 integrin antagonist natalizumab.

In adults, DHT acts as primary androgen in prostate and hair follicles. The only FDA-approved dermatological indication of finasteride is androgenetic alopecia. But, apprehension regarding sexual dysfunction associated with finasteride deters dermatologists from prescribing the drug and patients from taking the drug for androgenetic alopecia. Testosterone, through its humoral endocrine and local paracrine effects is relevant in central and peripheral modulation of sexual function than locally acting DHT. Several large population-based long-term placebo-controlled studies, using International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire and objective method (Nocturnal Penile Tumescence) to assess the erectile function have demonstrated no clear evidence of the negative effect of finasteride on erectile function. Reduction in ejaculatory volume is the only established causal relationship between finasteride and sexual dysfunction. Though finasteride causes significant reduction in all the semen parameters except sperm morphology, they did not fall below the threshold levels to interfere with fertility. Therefore, the sexual adverse effects associated with finasteride should be viewed in relation to normal prevalence and natural history of erectile dysfunction in the population, age of the patient, other confounding factors and also nocebo effect. The impact of finasteride on the prevention of prostate cancer has been discussed extensively. Finasteride is found to be effective in significantly reducing the incidence of low-grade prostate cancer. But the paradoxical increase in high-grade cancer in the finasteride group has been attributed to increased sensitivity and improved performance of prostate specific antigen levels to detect all grades of prostate cancer."

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we analyzed synoviocytes from RA patients for their miRNA expression. METHODS: Synoviocytes derived from surgical specimens obtained from RA patients were compared with those obtained from osteoarthritis (OA) patients for their expression of a panel of 156 miRNA with quantitative stem-loop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The miRNA whose expression decreased or increased in RA synoviocytes as compared with OA synoviocytes were identified, and their target genes were predicted by computer analysis. We used an in vitro system of enhancing the expression of specific miRNA by transfection of precursors into synoviocytes, and then we performed proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for cytokine production. The effects of transfection on predicted target protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) were then examined by Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: We found that miR-124a levels significantly decreased in RA synoviocytes as compared with OA synoviocytes. Transfection of precursor miR-124a into RA synoviocytes significantly suppressed their proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase. We identified a putative consensus site for miR-124a binding in the 3'-untranslated region of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK-2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) mRNA. Induction of miR-124a in RA synoviocytes significantly suppressed the production of the CDK-2 and MCP-1 proteins. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-124a specifically suppressed the reporter activity driven by the 3'-untranslated regions of CDK-2 and MCP-1 mRNA. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that miR-124a is a key miRNA in the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of RA synoviocytes."

The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular disorder, often associated with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which is characterized by reduced quantal release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve terminals. LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME: The Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is characterized by proximal muscle weakness initially affecting gait, autonomic symptoms (dry mouth, constipation, erectile failure) and augmentation of strength during initial voluntary activation. Symptomatic treatment of the junctional disorder is based on cholinergic drugs, immunosuppression, immunomodulation and physical therapy useful in case of unsuccessful antineoplastic therapy. CASE REPORT: A rare case of ovarian cancer with Eaton-Lambert syndrome is reported. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the gynecologic department, complaining of weakness and pain in her arms and shoulders. Physical therapy resulted in partial improvement. Treatment of paraneoplastic syndrome markedly improves the quality of life of cancer patients.

The illness was characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and (in the fatal case), shock and coagulopathy, compatible with YEL-AVD. Liver pathology showed diffuse, spotty necrosis, acidophilic degeneration, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, and microvesicular fat. No virological confirmation was obtained, so that both cases remain classified as \"suspect.\" The 1973 case is the earliest record of YEL-AVD; until now, the earliest known case of YEL-AVD had been in 1975 in Brazil, and most subsequent cases have been reported after 1995."

Epigenetic silencing in mammals involves DNA methylation and posttranslational modifications of core histones. Here we show that the H1 linker histone plays a key role in regulating both DNA methylation and histone H3 methylation at the H19 and Gtl2 loci in mouse ES cells. Some, but not all, murine H1 subtypes interact with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The interactions are direct and require a portion of the H1 C-terminal domain. Expression of an H1 subtype that interacts with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in ES cells leads to their recruitment and DNA methylation of the H19 and Gtl2 imprinting control regions. H1 also interferes with binding of the SET7/9 histone methyltransferase to the imprinting control regions, inhibiting production of an activating methylation mark on histone H3 lysine 4. H1-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3B and interference with the binding of SET7/9 also were observed with chromatin reconstituted in vitro. The data support a model in which H1 plays an active role in helping direct two processes that lead to the formation of epigenetic silencing marks. The data also provide evidence for functional differences among the H1 subtypes expressed in somatic mammalian cells."

The RET proto-oncogene encodes two isoforms of a receptor tyrosine kinase which plays a role in neural crest and kidney development. Ret ligands have been recently identified as the neuron survival factor GDNF (Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and Neurturin. Somatic rearrangements of RET, designated RET/PTCs, have been frequently detected in papillary thyroid carcinomas. In addition, distinct germ-line mutations of RET gene have been associated with the inherited cancer syndromes MEN (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia) 2A, 2B and FMTC (Familial Medullar Thyroid Carcinomas) as well as with the congenital megacolon or Hirschsprung's disease, thus enlightening a significant role of this receptor gene in diverse human pathologic conditions. In this study, by performing classical inhibition experiments using synthetic phosphopeptides and by site-directed mutagenesis of the putative docking site, we have determined that for Grb2 the latter is provided by the tyrosine 620 of Ret/ptc2 long isoform (corresponding to Tyr 1096 on proto-Ret). However, in intact cells, the interaction of Grb2 with the two short and long Ret isoforms expressed separately is of similar strength, thus suggesting that Ret short isoform interaction with Grb2 could be mediated not only by Shc but also by a molecule that binds preferentially to this isoform. This possibility is supported by the evidence that the mutant Ret/ptc2Y620F long isoform displays a weak coimmunoprecipitation with Grb2 and that this mutant, lacking the docking site for Grb2 but owing all the others phosphotyrosines, surprisingly displays a reduced transforming activity compared to that of the two WTs oncogenes. We thus conclude that in intact cells both Ret isoforms bind to Grb2, although with different modalities. In addition, the present results are in agreement with the possibility that different signal transduction pathways are associated with the two isoforms of Ret."

Here, we characterize vertebrate NDC1--a transmembrane nucleoporin conserved between yeast and metazoans. We show by RNA interference (RNAi) and biochemical depletion that NDC1 plays an important role in NPC and NE assembly in vivo and in vitro. RNAi experiments suggest a functional link between NDC1 and the soluble nucleoporins Nup93, Nup53, and Nup205. Importantly, NDC1 interacts with Nup53 in vitro. This suggests that NDC1 function involves forming a link between the NE membrane and soluble nucleoporins, thereby anchoring the NPC in the membrane."

Methylation of CpG sites in the control regions of tumor suppressor genes may be an important mechanism for their heritable, yet reversible, transcriptional inactivation. These changes in methylation may impair the proper expression and/or function of cell cycle regulatory genes and confer a selective growth advantage to affected cells. Detailed methylation analysis using genomic bisulfite sequencing was performed on a series of subclones of a bladder cancer cell line in which a hypermethylated p16 gene had been reactivated by transient treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript. Furthermore, we show that reactivant clones that expressed p16 at varying levels contained heterogeneous methylation patterns, suggesting that p16 expression can occur even in the presence of a relatively heavily methylated coding region. We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation."

Mutations in the parkin gene result in an autosomal recessive juvenile-onset form of Parkinson's disease. As an E3 ubiquitin-ligase, parkin promotes the attachment of ubiquitin onto specific substrate proteins. Defects in the ubiquitination of parkin substrates are therefore believed to lead to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Here, we identify the PSD-95/Discs-large/Zona Occludens-1 (PDZ) protein PICK1 as a novel parkin substrate. We find that parkin binds PICK1 via a PDZ-mediated interaction, which predominantly promotes PICK1 monoubiquitination rather than polyubiquitination. Consistent with monoubiquitination and recent work implicating parkin in proteasome-independent pathways, parkin does not promote PICK1 degradation. However, parkin regulates the effects of PICK1 on one of its other PDZ partners, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC). Overexpression of wild-type, but not PDZ binding- or E3 ubiquitin-ligase-defective parkin abolishes the previously described, protein kinase C-induced, PICK1-dependent potentiation of ASIC2a currents in non-neuronal cells. Conversely, the loss of parkin in hippocampal neurons from parkin knockout mice unmasks prominent potentiation of native ASIC currents, which is normally suppressed by endogenous parkin in wild-type neurons. Given that ASIC channels contribute to excitotoxicity, our work provides a mechanism explaining how defects in parkin-mediated PICK1 monoubiquitination could enhance ASIC activity and thereby promote neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease."

Generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from somatic cells has been successfully achieved by ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, also known as the Yamanaka factors. In practice, initial iPS colonies are picked based on their embryonic stem (ES) cell-like morphology, but often may go on to fail subsequent assays, such as the alkaline phosphate (AP) assay. In this study, we co-expressed through lenti-viral delivery the Yamanaka factors in amniotic fluid-derived (AF) cells. ES-like colonies were picked onto a traditional feeder layer and a high percentage AF-iPS with partial to no AP activity was found. Interestingly, we obtained an overwhelming majority of fully stained AP positive (AP+) AF-iPS colonies when colonies were first seeded on a feeder-free culture system, and then transferred to a feeder layer for expansion. Furthermore, colonies with no AP activity were not detected. This screening step decreased the variation seen between morphology and AP assay. We observed the AF-iPS colonies grown on the feeder layer with 28% AP+ colonies, 45% AP partially positive (AP+/-) colonies and 27% AP negative (AP-) colonies, while colonies screened by the feeder-free system were 84% AP+ colonies, 16% AP+/- colonies and no AP- colonies. The feeder-free screened AP+ AF-iPS colonies were also positive for pluripotent markers, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 as well as having differentiation abilities into three germ layers in vitro and in vivo.

Southern analysis of restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments from mouse/human hybrid cells containing only human chromosome 21 showed that the predominant higher-order repeating unit for pTRA-2 is a 3.9 kb structure. Analysis of a \"consensus\" in situ hybridisation profile derived from 13 normal individuals revealed the localisation of 73% of all centromeric autoradiographic grains over the five acrocentric chromosomes, with the following distribution: 20.4%, 21.5%, 17.1%, 7.3% and 6.5% on chromosomes 13, 14, 21, 15 and 22 respectively. An average of 1.4% of grains was found on the centromere of each of the remaining 19 nonacrocentric chromosomes. These results indicate the presence of a common subfamily of alpha satellite DNA on the five acrocentric chromosomes and suggest an evolutionary process consistent with recombination exchange of sequences between the nonhomologues.

OBJECTIVES: To detect carbapenemases in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected from patients in a university hospital in Thailand between October 2010 and August 2011. METHODS: A total of 4818 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were screened for the presence of carbapenemases by ertapenem and imipenem disc diffusion tests. All positive screening isolates were subjected to modified Hodge test, phenylboronic acid- and EDTA-carbapenem combined disc tests and two multiplex PCRs of bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM) and bla(GIM), and of bla(KPC), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA-48). Carbapenemase-producing isolates were typed by PFGE and then characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Conjugation was performed using a broth culture mating method. RESULTS: Two isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii produced NDM-1, whereas two other isolates of K. pneumoniae produced IMP-14a. DNA fingerprints revealed that the metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates were of different strains except for clonal strains of C. freundii. In vitro transfer of carbapenem resistance was successful for the eight MBL-producing isolates. All MBL producers were susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. The six NDM-producing isolates were recovered from the urine of three patients, who had no history of travel outside Thailand. Interestingly, one patient had chronic urinary tract infections caused by a K. pneumoniae strain and two strains of E. coli producing NDM-1. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of carbapenemases, particularly NDM-1, in Enterobacteriaceae is urgently needed to control and prevent the spread of these resistance determinants in our country."

Previously, EPAS1 and EGLN1, the major upstream regulators in the hypoxic pathway, were reportedly involved in the hemoglobin regulation in Tibetans. In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans. We first resequenced the entire genomic region (45.6 kb) of HMOX2 in Tibetans, which confirmed the previously suspected signal of positive selection on HMOX2 in Tibetans. Subsequent association analyses of hemoglobin levels in two independent Tibetan populations (a total of 1,250 individuals) showed a male-specific association between the HMOX2 variants and hemoglobin levels. Tibetan males with the derived C allele at rs4786504:T>C displayed lower hemoglobin level as compared with the T allele carriers. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments indicated that the C allele of rs4786504 could increase the expression of HMOX2, presumably leading to a more efficient breakdown of heme that may help maintain a relatively low hemoglobin level at high altitude. Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism."

All eukaryotic cells have MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways that participate in diverse cellular functions, including differentiation, survival, transformation and movement. Five distinct groups of MAPKs have been characterized in mammals, the most extensively studied of which is the Ras/Raf/MEK [MAPK/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase]/ERK cascade. Numerous stimuli, including growth factors and phorbol esters, activate MEK/ERK signalling. How disparate extracellular signals are translated by MEK/ERK into different cellular functions remains obscure. Originally identified in yeast, scaffold proteins are now recognized to contribute to the specificity of MEK/ERK pathways in mammalian cells. These scaffolds include KSR (kinase suppressor of Ras), beta-arrestin, MEK partner-1, Sef and IQGAP1. Scaffolds organize multiprotein signalling complexes. This targets MEK/ERK to specific substrates and facilitates communication with other pathways, thereby mediating diverse functions. The adaptor proteins regulate the kinetics, amplitude and localization of MEK/ERK signalling, providing an efficient mechanism that enables an individual extracellular stimulus to promote a specific biological response."

Experiments are reviewed that allow one to assign naturally occurring DNA-containing plasmas to either of two classes by virtue of their sensitivity to aggregation upon dehydration in organic solvents. The interphase nuclei of higher cells are relatively insensitive, while the DNA plasmas represented by bacterial nucleoids, vegetative bacteriophage and the chromosomes of dinoflagellates are sensitive. In higher cells the bulk of DNA is organised with histones in the form of nucleosomes. In prokaryotes and in the pool of vegetative phage DNA the most abundant histone-like protein HU is not associated with the bulk DNA, but localised in the border region with ribosomes where transcription and translation occur. These experimental results strongly suggest that the two classes of DNA plasmas are distinguishable by a low (1:10) or high (1:1) protein-to-DNA ratio. The hypothesis is formulated that the vegetative DNA (replicating and transcribing), throughout the living world, is nucleosome-free; during evolution, nucleosomes would have been introduced as a simple and adequate means for compacting the resting DNA. Condensation of DNA does not occur with prokaryotic nucleoids, but does take place when DNA is withdrawn from the vegetative phage pool to become packaged into phage heads. Dinoflagellate chromosomes are rather condensed although structurally different from eukaryotic chromosomes (e.g., those from Euglena) and are much more aggregation-sensitive."

Whole blood has not been explored as a potential clinical material for monitoring the expression of miRNAs in RA. We sought to determine whether miRNA levels detected in whole blood samples correlated with those detected in simultaneously isolated peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same individuals, thus establishing the feasibility of using whole blood as a viable clinical material for monitoring miRNA expression in RA and other disorders. We demonstrated a highly significant linear correlation between miR-146a and miR-155 expression in PBMC and whole blood, from both healthy individuals and RA patients. Whole blood samples accurately reflect miRNA levels in PBMC and would be useful in monitoring the expression of miRNAs as biomarkers. The detection of miRNA levels in samples that are readily obtained in routine clinical practice, such as whole blood, enhances their potential utility in detecting changes in the immunological mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases such as RA."

Different responses, in terms both of efficacy and toxicity, are commonly observed for any drug administered to apparently homogeneous groups of patients. It is estimated that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) cause 3-6% of all hospitalizations, accounting for 5% to 9% of hospital admission costs. The skin is often involved in ADRs and although most cutaneous ADRs have a favorable course, they may present as severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (also referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. SCARs are associated with significant mortality and require prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment. Pharmacogenetics studies individual variants in the DNA sequence associated with drug efficacy and toxicity, allowing prescription of a drug to patients expected to benefit from it, and excluding from treatment those who are at risk of developing ADRs. Pharmacogenetics already achieved several important results in the prevention of SCARs, and pharmacogenetic testing is now recommended by regulatory agencies before administration of abacavir and carbamazepine, leading to reduced incidence of SCARs. In this review, the pharmacogenetic associations of SCARs that have been validated in independent, case-control association studies will be presented. By familiarizing with principles of pharmacogenetics, dermatologists should be able to correlate specific cutaneous ADR phenotypes to the underlying genotype, thus contributing to better drug safety and facilitating drug discovery, development and approval."

Wernicke's encephalopathy results from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Common causes include alcoholism and gastric disorders. Wernicke's has been described in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); however, given these patients' immunosuppressed state, the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy is not apparent. Case Presentation. A 31-year-old previously healthy male presented to the ER complaining of progressive dyspnea. Workup revealed HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was treated and improved. On day 14 he became confused and developed nystagmus and ataxia. Considering his immunocompromised state, infectious and neoplastic etiologies topped the differential diagnosis. CT head was negative. Lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Brain MRI revealed increased T2 signal in the medial thalamus bilaterally. Intravenous thiamine was administered resulting in resolution of symptoms. Discussion. The classic triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy occurs in 10% of cases. When immunosuppressed patients develop acute neurologic symptoms infectious or neoplastic etiologies must be excluded. However, given the relative safety of thiamine supplementation, there should be a low threshold for initiating therapy in order to reverse the symptoms and prevent progression to Korsakoff dementia, which is permanent."

BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, clinically heterogeneous, congenital red cell aplasia: 40% of patients have congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that in western countries, the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in about 50% of patients. There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. RPS14 was also examined due to its implied involvement in 5q- syndrome. RESULTS: Mutations in RPS19, RPL5, RPL11 and RPS17 were identified in five, four, two and one of the probands, respectively. In total, 12 (27%) of the Japanese Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients had mutations in ribosomal protein genes. No mutations were detected in RPS14, RPS24 or RPL35A. All patients with RPS19 and RPL5 mutations had physical abnormalities. Remarkably, cleft palate was seen in two patients with RPL5 mutations, and thumb anomalies were seen in six patients with an RPS19 or RPL5 mutation. In contrast, a small-for-date phenotype was seen in five patients without an RPL5 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a slightly lower frequency of mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia compared to the frequency reported in western countries. Genotype-phenotype data suggest an association between anomalies and RPS19 mutations, and a negative association between small-for-date phenotype and RPL5 mutations."

Patients with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are also at risk of developing tumors of the major and minor salivary glands. Patients with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome have various mutations in the CYLD gene, a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 16q. To date, 68 unique CYLD mutations have been identified. We describe two families with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, one with familial cylindromatosis and one with multiple familial trichoepithelioma, which showed wide inter-family phenotypic variability. Analysis of germline mutations of the CYLD and PTCH genes was performed using peripheral blood. In addition, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were analyzed for PTCH somatic mutations and cylindroma cell cultures were obtained directly from patients for further growth and analysis. Clinically, the major features of Brooke-Spiegler syndrome include the presence of heterogeneous skin tumors and wide inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability. Histopathologically, both cylindromas and trichoepitheliomas were found in affected individuals. Mutations or loss of heterozygosity was not found in CYLD and PTCH genes. In CYLD and PTCH mutation-negative patients, other genes may be affected and further studies are needed to clarify whether these patients may be affected by de novo germline mutations."

OBJECTIVE: To identify the abnormal karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and explore prognostic implications in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). METHODS: FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q, +8, -7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases. SPSS 11.5 software and correlation analysis were used to analyze the relativity among the abnormal chromosomes, the prognosis and the disease conversion in 37 MDS patients. RESULTS: Karyotype abnormalities were found in 21 (56.8%) of 37 cases, among which 6 (16.2%) were complex karyotypes, 9 (24.3%) +8, 2(5.4%) -5/5q-, 2(5.4%) -7/7q-. In the median time of follow-up of 12 months, 12 cases transformed into acute leukemia. Complex karyotypes were significantly associated with the poor prognosis and leukemia transformation. + 8 and -7/7q- abnormalities were correlated with the death. CONCLUSIONS: FISH was more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics for detecting mini-clonal abnormality. There are some differences in abnormal karyotypes between patients in China and the western countries. Multi-probes used in cytogenetic detections may predict the patient' s prognosis more accurately. The higher proportion of abnormal karyotypes the poorer prognosis."

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disease related to 11p15.5 genetic and epigenetic alterations, among them loss-of-function CDKN1C mutations. Intriguing is that CDKN1C gain-of-function variations were recently found in patients with IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and genital anomalies). BWS and IMAGe share an imprinted mode of inheritance; familial analysis demonstrated the presence of the phenotype exclusively when the mutant CDKN1C allele is inherited from the mother. Interestingly, both IMAGe and BWS are characterized by growth disturbances, although with opposite clinical phenotypes; IMAGe patients display growth restriction whereas BWS patients display overgrowth. CDKN1C codifies for CDKN1C/KIP2, a nuclear protein and potent tight-binding inhibitor of several cyclin/Cdk complexes, playing a role in maintenance of the nonproliferative state of cells. The mirror phenotype of BWS and IMAGe can be, at least in part, explained by the effect of mutations on protein functions. All the IMAGe-associated mutations are clustered in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding domain of CDKN1C and cause a dramatic increase in the stability of the protein, which probably results in a functional gain of growth inhibition properties. In contrast, BWS mutations are not clustered within a single domain, are loss-of-function, and promote cell proliferation. CDKN1C is an example of allelic heterogeneity associated with opposite syndromes."

BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common health problems for children and adolescents. If not successfully treated, it can impact patients and families with significant disability due to loss of school, work, and social function. When headaches become frequent, it is essential to try to prevent the headaches. For children and adolescents, this is guided by extrapolation from adult studies, a limited number of small studies in children and adolescents and practitioner preference. The aim of the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) study is to determine the most effective preventive agent to use in children and adolescents. METHODS: CHAMP is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, comparative effectiveness study of amitriptyline and topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, designed to mirror real-world practice, sponsored by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institutes of Health (U01NS076788). The study will recruit 675 subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years old, inclusive, who have migraine with or without aura or chronic migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, with at least 4 headaches in the 28 days prior to randomization. The subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 (amitriptyline: topiramate: placebo) ratio. Doses are weight based and will be slowly titrated over an 8-week period to a target dose of 1 mg/kg of amitriptyline and 2 mg/kg of topiramate. The primary outcome will be a 50% reduction in headache frequency between the 28-day baseline and the final 28 days of treatment (weeks 20-24). CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the CHAMP study is to obtain level 1 evidence for the effectiveness of amitriptyline and topiramate in the prevention of migraine in children and adolescents. If this study proves to be positive, it will provide information to the practicing physician as how to best prevent migraine in children and adolescents and subsequently improve the disability and outcomes."

BACKGROUND: Although recent studies have identified genes expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that induce pluripotency, the molecular underpinnings of normal stem cell function remain poorly understood. The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene is highly expressed in hESCs and poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers; however, its role in these settings has been unclear. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that HMGA1 is highly expressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs and hESCs, with intermediate levels in ECCs and low levels in fibroblasts. When hESCs are induced to differentiate, HMGA1 decreases and parallels that of other pluripotency factors. Conversely, forced expression of HMGA1 blocks differentiation of hESCs. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM). HMGA1 increases the number and size of iPSC colonies compared to OSKM controls. Surprisingly, there was normal differentiation in vitro and benign teratoma formation in vivo of the HMGA1-derived iPSCs. During the reprogramming process, HMGA1 induces the expression of pluripotency genes, including SOX2, LIN28, and cMYC, while knockdown of HMGA1 in hESCs results in the repression of these genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that HMGA1 binds to the promoters of these pluripotency genes in vivo. In addition, interfering with HMGA1 function using a short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative construct blocks cellular reprogramming to a pluripotent state. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming from a somatic cell to a fully pluripotent stem cell. These findings identify a novel role for HMGA1 as a key regulator of the stem cell state by inducing transcriptional networks that drive pluripotency. Although further studies are needed, these HMGA1 pathways could be exploited in regenerative medicine or as novel therapeutic targets for poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers."

Requests for the D22S FISH assay were retrospectively reviewed over a 29-month period in our institution. Positive test results for D22S FISH and other abnormalities found by other FISH assays and G-banding were correlated to submitting specialist and indication. Thirteen medical services ordered D22S FISH testing on 297 patients over 29 months. The detection rate for all cytogenetic aberrations was 9.4% (28 of 297) including 5.4% (16 of 297) for D22S detection by FISH and 2.7% (8 of 297) for detection of additional cytogenetic anomalies by G-banding cytogenetics. Sixty-six of 297 patients negative by D22S FISH and G-banding were screened using other FISH assays and 3 of 47 (6.4%) patients screened using subtelomeric probes were positive for deletion and 1 of 3 (33%) patients screened for Prader-Willi syndrome was positive for deletion. Pediatric geneticists requested 53.9% (160 of 297) of the tests, yielding 60.7% (17 of 28) of positive test results. Tetralogy of Fallot and developmental delay were the indications associated with the most positive test results. In our institution, pediatric geneticists identify the largest spectrum of indications with D22S and appear most aware of the association of developmental delay with D22S. Performing conventional cytogenetics and other FISH assays, in addition to FISH for D22S, is important because there is considerable overlap between D22S and the phenotype of several other syndromes."

Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease."

Several related isoforms of p38MAPK have been identified and cloned in many species. Although they all contain the dual phosphorylation motif TGY, the expression of these isoforms is not ubiquitous. p38alpha and -beta2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p38gamma and -delta appear to have more restricted expression. Because there is evidence for selective activation by upstream kinases and selective preference for downstream substrates, the functions of these conserved proteins is still incompletely understood. We have demonstrated that the renal mesangial cell expresses the mRNA for all the isoforms of p38MAPK, with p38alpha mRNA expressed at the highest level, followed by p38gamma and the lowest levels of expression by p38beta2 and -delta. To determine the functional effects of these proteins on interleukin (IL)-1beta-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, we transduced TAT-p38 chimeric proteins into renal mesangial cells and assessed the effects of wild-type and mutant p38 isoforms on ligand induced iNOS expression. We show that whereas p38gamma and -delta had minimal effects on iNOS expression, p38alpha and -beta2 significantly altered its expression. p38alpha mutant and p38beta2 wild-type dose dependently inhibited IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression. These data suggest that p38alpha and beta2 have reciprocal effects on iNOS expression in the mesangial cell, and these observations may have important consequences for the development of selective inhibitors targeting the p38MAPK family of proteins."

BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by benign tumours in multiple organs, including the brain, kidneys, skin, lungs and heart. Our objective was to evaluate everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in the treatment of angiomyolipoma in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC. METHODS: EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 (NCT00789828), a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, examined everolimus in treating SEGA associated with TSC. Patients with serial SEGA growth from pre-baseline to baseline scans were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 4.5 mg/m(2)/day everolimus (target blood trough: 5-15 ng/mL; n = 78) or placebo (n = 39). Angiomyolipoma response rates were analysed in patients (n = 44) with target baseline angiomyolipoma lesions ( > 1 angiomyolipoma; longest diameter > 1.0 cm). An angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed angiomyolipoma response, was assessed by kidney CT or MRI screening at baseline, at 12, 24 and 48 weeks and annually. RESULTS: Angiomyolipoma response rates were 53.3% (16/30) and 0% (0/14) for everolimus- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Angiomyolipoma reductions > 50% in the sum of volumes of all target lesions were seen only in everolimus-treated patients (56.5, 78.3 and 80.0%) compared with placebo-treated patients (0% at each time point) at Weeks 12, 24 and 48, respectively. Greater percentages of everolimus-treated patients had angiomyolipoma reductions > 30% at these same time points (82.6, 100 and 100% versus 8.3, 18.2 and 16.7% for everolimus versus placebo, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus showed efficacy in reducing angiomyolipoma lesion volume in patients with SEGA associated with TSC.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789828; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00789828?term=EXIST-1&rank=1."

          "context": "Psychosurgery and deep brain stimulation as ultima ratio treatment for refractory depression. For decades, the most severe, protracted and therapy-resistant forms of major depression have compelled clinicians and researchers to look for last resort treatment. Early psychosurgical procedures were hazardous and often associated with severe and persistent side effects including avolition, apathy and change of personality. With the introduction of psychopharmacological treatments in the 1950s, the frequency of ablative procedures declined rapidly. The past decade, however, has witnessed the resurgence of surgical strategies as a result of refined techniques and advances such as high frequency stimulation of deep brain nuclei. Recent data suggest that the overall effect of high frequency stimulation lies in the functional inhibition of neural activity in the region stimulated. Contrary to other psychosurgical procedures, high frequency stimulation reversibly modulates targeted brain areas and allows a postsurgical adaption of the stimulation parameters according to clinical outcome. With increased understanding of the brain regions and functional circuits involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, major depression has emerged as a target for new psychosurgical approaches to selectively and precisely modulate neural areas involved in the disease process. Recent studies of minimally intervening procedures report good clinical outcome in the treatment of therapy-resistant forms of major depression. High frequency stimulation was successfully applied in several small samples of patients with treatment-resistant depression when the stimulation focused on different areas, e.g., nucleus accumbens, the lateral habenula or cortical areas. Nevertheless, the reticence toward psychosurgery, even for those patients suffering from the most debilitating forms of depression, still prevails, even though recent studies have shown significant improvement in terms of quality of life with the limitation that the number of treated cases has been small. In any event, valid and unambiguous criteria for patient eligibility have yet to be refined and standardized. In this review, we suggest possible standard criteria for the application of deep brain stimulation on patients suffering from otherwise treatment-resistant depression."

BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common health problems for children and adolescents. If not successfully treated, it can impact patients and families with significant disability due to loss of school, work, and social function. When headaches become frequent, it is essential to try to prevent the headaches. For children and adolescents, this is guided by extrapolation from adult studies, a limited number of small studies in children and adolescents and practitioner preference. The aim of the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) study is to determine the most effective preventive agent to use in children and adolescents. METHODS: CHAMP is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, comparative effectiveness study of amitriptyline and topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, designed to mirror real-world practice, sponsored by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institutes of Health (U01NS076788). The study will recruit 675 subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years old, inclusive, who have migraine with or without aura or chronic migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, with at least 4 headaches in the 28 days prior to randomization. The subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 (amitriptyline: topiramate: placebo) ratio. Doses are weight based and will be slowly titrated over an 8-week period to a target dose of 1 mg/kg of amitriptyline and 2 mg/kg of topiramate. The primary outcome will be a 50% reduction in headache frequency between the 28-day baseline and the final 28 days of treatment (weeks 20-24). CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the CHAMP study is to obtain level 1 evidence for the effectiveness of amitriptyline and topiramate in the prevention of migraine in children and adolescents. If this study proves to be positive, it will provide information to the practicing physician as how to best prevent migraine in children and adolescents and subsequently improve the disability and outcomes."

OBJECTIVE: A novel human endogenous retroviral element, designated as syncytin, has been suggested as a contributor to normal placental architecture, especially in the fusion processes of cytotrophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblasts. We tested the hypothesis of whether the gene expression of syncytin may be altered in cases with placental dysfunction such as preeclampsia or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: We included 30 women with normal pregnancies, 16 with preeclampsia, and 6 with HELLP syndrome. After delivery, messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) of syncytin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin were analyzed in placental villi with use of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In placental villi, syncytin mRNA/beta-actin mRNA and syncytin mRNA/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA ratios were lower in patients with preeclampsia (P <.05) or HELLP syndrome than in healthy control subjects. CONCLUSION: A reduced placental expression of syncytin may contribute to altered cell fusion processes in placentogenesis and disturbed placental function in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy."

Within this complex, calsequestrin, triadin, and JCN appear to be critical for normal regulation of ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium (Ca) release. Junctin and triadin exhibit 60% to 70% amino acid homology in their transmembrane domains, including repeated KEKE motifs important for macromolecular protein-protein interactions within their SR luminal tails.

More specifically, both in vitro adenoviral gene transfer and in vivo gene-targeting techniques to manipulate JCN expression levels have shown that JCN is an essential factor in maintaining normal cardiac Ca handling and cardiac function.

OBJECTIVE: The genes encoding tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 4 and TIMP2 span chromosomes 3p24.2-p26 and 17q25, respectively, which are the locations of familial moyamoya disease (FMMD) genes. We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TIMP2 and TIMP4 genes in FMMD patients to determine genetic predispositions. METHODS: Eleven blood samples from FMMD patients were recruited. Controls included 50 blood samples from patients with nonfamilial moyamoya disease (MMD) and another 50 blood samples from non-MMD persons. We evaluated the promoter regions, exon-intron junctions, and the exons of the TIMP2 and TIMP4 genes by direct sequencing, and compared single nucleotide polymorphisms frequencies among the study groups. RESULTS: A significantly higher frequency of a heterozygous genotype was found in the TIMP2 promoter region at position -418 in FMMD; that is, the G/C heterozygous genotype at position -418 was observed in nine of 11 patients with FMMD, in 16 out of 50 nonfamilial MMD control participants, and in 14 out of 50 non-MMD control participants (FMMD versus nonfamilial MMD: odds ratio, 9.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-49.48; P = 0.005; and FMMD versus non-MMD: odds ratio, 10.50; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-54.55; P = 0.001). This base at position -418 corresponds to the third base of the GAGGCTGGG sequence, an Sp1 binding site. Thus, changes in this position may influence Sp1 binding and subsequent transcription of the gene. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the presence of a G/C heterozygous genotype at position -418 in TIMP2 promoter could be a genetic predisposing factor for FMMD."

BACKGROUND: The stiff-man syndrome is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature. Autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase are present in about 60 percent of patients with the syndrome. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, seeking autoantibodies directed against nervous system antigens in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by immunocytochemical techniques, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. Serum samples from all three patients were negative for autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen were not detected in control patients with the stiff-man syndrome without breast cancer or in patients with cancer who did not have the syndrome. Within the nervous system, the 128-kd autoantigen was localized in neurons and concentrated at synapses. CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer."

We screened for the presence of LVNC and related clinical characteristics in a 5-generation Chinese family. METHODS: Comprehensive medical history was obtained from 40 members in a 5-generation Chinese family. Systemic clinical investigations including echocardiography (UCG), routine and ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), X-rays were performed in 33 family members. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance image (MRI) was carried out in 2 family members. RESULTS: Sudden cardiac death (including 1 occurred while following-up) was reported in 7 family members (17.5%, 7/40). LVNC was diagnosed in 10 out of the 33 family members (30.3%) and heart enlargement was evidenced in 3, heart failure in 2, complete left branch conductive block in 3, serious sick sinus syndrome (SSS) treated with permanent pacemaker implantation in 1 and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation procedure in 1 out of these 10 LVNC patients. Primary pedigree analysis revealed that offspring from female patients were at the highest risk to be affected by LVNC (15/18, 83.3%) while LVNC was absent in offspring of male LVNC patients (0/8). Moreover, clinical heart failure symptoms and arrhythmias were more severe in female LVNC patients than in male LVNC patients. CONCLUSION: Primary familial investigation reveals the matrilineal inheritance of familial LVNC in this 5-generation Chinese family, further investigations are warranted to explore the potential mutations in the mitochondrial genome responsible for LVNC in this family."

Snail1 (Snail) and Snail2 (Slug) are transcription factors that share a similar DNA binding structure of four and five C2H2 zinc finger motifs (ZF), respectively. Both factors bind specifically to a subset of E-box motifs (E2-box: CAGGTG/CACCTG) in target promoters like the E-cadherin promoter and are key mediators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, there are differences in the biological actions, in binding affinities to E-cadherin promoter, and in the target genes of Snail1 and Snail2, although the molecular bases are presently unknown. In particular, the role of each Snail1 and Snail2 ZF in the binding to E-boxes and in EMT induction has not been previously explored. We have approached this question by modeling Snail1 and Snail2 protein-DNA interactions and through mutational and functional assays of different ZFs. Results show that Snail1 efficient repression and binding to human and mouse E-cadherin promoter as well as EMT-inducing ability require intact ZF1 and ZF2, while for Snail2, either ZF3 or ZF4 is essential for those functions. Furthermore, the differential distribution of E2-boxes in mouse and human E-cadherin promoters also contributes to the differential Snail factor activity. These data indicate a non-equivalent role of Snail1 and Snail2 ZFs in gene repression, contributing to the elucidation of the molecular differences between these important EMT regulators."

The local expression of proteins involved in handling glutamate may be regulated by the number and activity of synapses in regions of glutamatergic innervation. The systematically varying innervation of inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea provides a model to test this suggestion. IHCs are glutamatergic and form a single row along the cochlear spiral. Along this row the number of afferent fibers terminating on IHCs increases toward the base, reaching a peak and thereafter declining. The afferents are segregated so that higher spontaneous rate fibers terminate on the pillar-cell side of the IHC and lower rate fibers terminate on the modiolar side. Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral. Immunofluorescent labeling for GLAST in IHC supporting cells increased in intensity to a peak in the region of 6-9 mm from the apex. Immunogold labeling for GLAST was greater overall in these cells in the 10 mm region than in the 1 mm region and also on the pillar-cell side of the IHC compared with the modiolar side. Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST."

PURPOSE: Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) is a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF kinase. Our multicenter, single-arm, phase II study assessed the safety and clinical activity of dabrafenib in BRAF(V600E/K) mutation-positive metastatic melanoma (mut(+) MM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Histologically confirmed patients with stage IV BRAF(V600E/K) mut(+) MM received oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily until disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse events (AEs). The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate in BRAF(V600E) mut(+) MM patients. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Exploratory objectives included the comparison of BRAF mutation status between tumor-specific circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and tumor tissue, and the evaluation of cfDNA as a predictor of clinical outcome. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with BRAF(V600E) and 16 patients with BRAF(V600K) mut(+) MM were enrolled onto the study. In the BRAF(V600E) group, 45 patients (59%) had a confirmed response (95% CI, 48.2 to 70.3), including five patients (7%) with complete responses. Two patients (13%) with BRAF(V600K) mut(+) MM had a confirmed partial response (95% CI, 0 to 28.7). In the BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) groups, median PFS was 6.3 months and 4.5 months, and median OS was 13.1 months and 12.9 months, respectively. The most common AEs were arthralgia (33%), hyperkeratosis (27%), and pyrexia (24%). Overall, 25 patients (27%) experienced a serious AE and nine patients (10%) had squamous cell carcinoma. Baseline cfDNA levels predicted response rate and PFS in BRAF(V600E) mut(+) MM patients. CONCLUSION: Dabrafenib was well tolerated and clinically active in patients with BRAF(V600E/K) mut(+) MM. cfDNA may be a useful prognostic and response marker in future studies."

OBJECTIVE: To describe baseline headache characteristics of children and adolescents participating in a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, comparative effectiveness study of amitriptyline, topiramate, and placebo for the prevention of migraine (CHAMP Study). METHODS: Children and adolescents (age 8-17 years old, inclusive) diagnosed with migraine with or without aura, having headaches at least four times per month were enrolled from 2012 through 2014. The trial involved a baseline period (minimum of 28 days) during which prospective diaries were completed and demographics and headache features obtained. RESULTS: A total of 488 children and adolescents (mean age 14.0 \u00b1 2.4 years) agreed to participate in the trial, with 361 randomized and 127 not randomized. Randomized subjects had a 5.5 \u00b1 3.1 year history of headaches, with 15.1 \u00b1 7.1 headache days per month (based upon retrospective report at screening visit). Prospective diaries reported 11.5 \u00b1 6.1 headache days per 28 day baseline. Across this 28 day period, reported headache days per week were stable (about 3 headache days per week). Recording of individual headache features by diary (n = 4136 headache days) showed characteristics consistent with migraine (mean duration 10.5 \u00b1 8.1 hours, mean severity 6.0 \u00b1 2.1, 60% throbbing, 55% with activity worsening headaches, 55% with photophobia, and 47% with phonophobia). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline data from the CHAMP Study suggested that the randomized sample was representative of the real world population of children and adolescents that present for treatment of migraine. Headaches in children and adolescents recorded during a 28 day prospective baseline period in this multi-site comparative effectiveness study did not change over the course of the baseline period, even though a clear diagnosis, recommendation for effective acute treatment, and standardized education about healthy habits occurred prior to the diary collection period."

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Efforts to identify the genetic basis of mammalian sleep have included quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and gene targeting of known core circadian clock genes. We combined three different genetic approaches to identify and test a positional candidate sleep gene - the circadian gene casein kinase 1 epsilon (Csnk1e), which is located in a QTL we identified for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep on chromosome 15. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Using electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings, baseline sleep was examined in a 12-h light:12-h dark (LD 12:12) cycle in mice of seven genotypes, including Csnk1e(tau/tau) and Csnk1e(-/-) mutant mice, Csnk1e (B6.D2) and Csnk1e (D2.B6) congenic mice, and their respective wild-type littermate control mice. Additionally, Csnk1e(tau/tau) and wild-type mice were examined in constant darkness (DD). Csnk1e(tau/tau) mutant mice and both Csnk1e (B6.D2) and Csnk1e (D2.B6) congenic mice showed significantly higher proportion of sleep time spent in REM sleep during the dark period than wild-type controls - the original phenotype for which the QTL on chromosome 15 was identified. This phenotype persisted in Csnk1e(tau/tau) mice while under free-running DD conditions. Other sleep phenotypes observed in Csnk1e(tau/tau) mice and congenics included a decreased number of bouts of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and an increased average NREM sleep bout duration. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a role for Csnk1e in regulating not only the timing of sleep, but also the REM sleep amount and NREM sleep architecture, and support Csnk1e as a causal gene in the sleep QTL on chromosome 15."

BACKGROUND: Digoxin is a widely used drug for ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), despite a scarcity of randomised trial data. We studied the use and outcomes of digoxin in patients in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). METHODS: For this retrospective analysis, we included and classified patients from ROCKET AF on the basis of digoxin use at baseline and during the study. Patients in ROCKET AF were recruited from 45 countries and had AF and risk factors putting them at moderate-to-high risk of stroke, with or without heart failure. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for baseline characteristics and drugs to investigate the association of digoxin with all-cause mortality, vascular death, and sudden death. ROCKET AF was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00403767. FINDINGS: In 14,171 randomly assigned patients, digoxin was used at baseline in 5239 (37%). Patients given digoxin were more likely to be female (42% vs 38%) and have a history of heart failure (73% vs 56%), diabetes (43% vs 38%), and persistent AF (88% vs 77%; p<0\u00b70001 for each comparison). After adjustment, digoxin was associated with increased all-cause mortality (5\u00b741 vs 4\u00b730 events per 100 patients-years; hazard ratio 1\u00b717; 95% CI 1\u00b704-1\u00b732; p=0\u00b70093), vascular death (3\u00b755 vs 2\u00b769 per 100 patient-years; 1\u00b719; 1\u00b703-1\u00b739, p=0\u00b70201), and sudden death (1\u00b768 vs 1\u00b712 events per 100 patient-years; 1\u00b736; 1\u00b708-1\u00b770, p=0\u00b70076). INTERPRETATION: Digoxin treatment was associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality, vascular death, and sudden death in patients with AF. This association was independent of other measured prognostic factors, and although residual confounding could account for these results, these data show the possibility of digoxin having these effects. A randomised trial of digoxin in treatment of AF patients with and without heart failure is needed. FUNDING: Janssen Research & Development and Bayer HealthCare AG."

Like that of many protein-coding genes, expression of the p21(CIP1) cell cycle inhibitor is regulated at the level of transcription elongation. While many transcriptional activators have been shown to stimulate elongation, the mechanisms by which promoter-specific repressors regulate pausing and elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNA PolII) are not well described. Here we report that the transcription factor Sp3 inhibits basal p21(CIP1) gene expression by promoter-bound RNA PolII. Knockdown of Sp3 led to increased p21(CIP1) mRNA levels and reduced occupancy of the negative elongation factor (NELF) at the p21(CIP1) promoter, although the level of binding of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) kinase was not increased. Sp3 depletion correlated with increased H3K36me3 and H2Bub1, two histone modifications associated with transcription elongation. Further, Sp3 was shown to promote the binding of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the p21(CIP1) promoter, leading to reduced H3S10 phosphorylation, a finding consistent with Sp3-dependent regulation of the local balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. Analysis of other targets of Sp3-mediated repression suggests that, in addition to previously described SUMO modification-dependent chromatin-silencing mechanisms, inhibition of the transition of paused RNA PolII to productive elongation, described here for p21(CIP1), is a general mechanism by which transcription factor Sp3 fine-tunes gene expression."

MOTIVATION: Transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins are embedded in the outer membranes of mitochondria, Gram-negative bacteria and chloroplasts. These proteins perform critical functions, including active ion-transport and passive nutrient intake. Therefore, there is a need for accurate prediction of secondary and tertiary structure of TMB proteins. Traditional homology modeling methods, however, fail on most TMB proteins since very few non-homologous TMB structures have been determined. Yet, because TMB structures conform to specific construction rules that restrict the conformational space drastically, it should be possible for methods that do not depend on target-template homology to be applied successfully. RESULTS: We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. Using the transFold dataset TMBpro predicts secondary structure with per-residue accuracy (Q(2)) of 77.8%, a correlation coefficient of 0.54, and TMBpro predicts beta-contacts with precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.67. Using the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts secondary structure with Q(2) of 88.3% and a correlation coefficient of 0.75. All of these performance results exceed previously published results by 4% or more. Working with the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts the tertiary structure of transmembrane segments with RMSD <6.0 A for 9 of 14 proteins. For 6 of 14 predictions, the RMSD is <5.0 A, with a GDT_TS score greater than 60.0. AVAILABILITY: http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/psss.html."

Herein, we report that mTORC2 plays an important role in PC3 androgen refractory prostate cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Aloe-emodin, a natural compound found in aloe, inhibited both proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 cells. Protein content analysis suggested that activation of the downstream substrates of mTORC2, Akt and PKC\u03b1, was inhibited by aloe-emodin treatment. Pull-down assay and in vitro kinase assay results indicated that aloe-emodin could bind with mTORC2 in cells and inhibit its kinase activity. Aloe-emodin also exhibited tumor suppression effects in vivo in an athymic nude mouse model. Collectively, our data suggest that mTORC2 plays an important role in prostate cancer development and aloe-emodin suppresses prostate cancer progression by targeting mTORC2."

BACKGROUND: The response to the anticoagulant drug warfarin is greatly affected by genetic polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes. Genotyping these polymorphisms has been shown to be important in reducing the time of the trial and error process for finding the maintenance dose of warfarin thus reducing the risk of adverse effects of the drug. METHOD: We developed a real-time isothermal DNA amplification system for genotyping three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence warfarin response. For each SNP, real-time isothermal Helicase Dependent Amplification (HDA) reactions were performed to amplify a DNA fragment containing the SNP. Amplicons were detected by fluorescently labeled allele specific probes during real-time HDA amplification. RESULTS: Fifty clinical samples were analyzed by the HDA-based method, generating a total of 150 results. Of these, 148 were consistent between the HDA-based assays and a reference method. The two samples with unresolved HDA-based test results were repeated and found to be consistent with the reference method. CONCLUSION: The HDA-based assays demonstrated a clinically acceptable performance for genotyping the VKORC1 -1639G>A SNP and two SNPs (430C>T and 1075A>C) for the CYP2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3), all of which are relevant in warfarin pharmacogenentics."

In our current study, we demonstrate that the replication checkpoint is activated in the absence of Ctf4, and that the interaction between the MCM helicase-go ichi ni san (GINS) complex and DNA polymerase alpha (Pol alpha)-primase is destabilized specifically in a ctf4Delta mutant. An in vitro interaction between GINS and DNA Pol alpha was also found to be mediated by Ctf4. The same interaction was not affected in the absence of the replication checkpoint mediators Tof1 or Mrc1. In ctf4Delta cells, DNA pol alpha became significantly unstable and was barely detectable at the replication forks in HU. In contrast, the quantities of helicase and DNA pol epsilon bound to replication forks were almost unchanged but their localizations were widely and abnormally dispersed in the mutant cells compared with wild type. These results lead us to propose that Ctf4 is a key connector between DNA helicase and Pol alpha and is required for the coordinated progression of the replisome."

The detection of class A serine-carbapenemases among species of Enterobacteriaceae remains a challenging issue. Methods of identification for routine use in clinical microbiology laboratories have not been standardized to date. We developed a novel screening methodology suitable for countries with high basal levels of carbapenem resistance due to non-carbapenemase-mediated mechanisms and standardized several simple confirmatory methods that allow the recognition of bacteria producing class A carbapenemases, including KPC, Sme, IMI, NMC-A, and GES, by using boronic acid (BA) derivatives. A total of 28 genetically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae strains producing several class A carbapenemases were tested. Thirty-eight genetically unrelated negative controls were included. The isolates were tested against imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), and ertapenem (ETP) by MIC and disk diffusion assays in order to select appropriate tools to screen for suspected carbapenemase production. It was possible to differentiate class A carbapenemase-producing bacteria from non-carbapenemase-producing bacteria by using solely the routine IPM susceptibility tests. The modified Hodge test was evaluated and found to be highly sensitive, although false-positive results were documented. Novel BA-based methods (a double-disk synergy test and combined-disk and MIC tests) using IPM, MEM, and ETP, in combination with 3-aminophenylboronic acid as an inhibitor, were designed as confirmatory tools. On the basis of the performance of these methods, a sensitive flow chart for suspicion and confirmation of class A carbapenemase production in species of Enterobacteriaceae was designed. By using this methodology, isolates producing KPC, GES, Sme, IMI, and NMC-A carbapenemases were successfully distinguished from those producing other classes of beta-lactamases (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpCs, and metallo-beta-lactamases, etc). These methods will rapidly provide useful information needed for targeting antimicrobial therapy and appropriate infection control."

The structure revealed that the \u03b11I domain undergoes a major conformational change upon binding of the collagen peptide. This involves a large movement in the C-terminal helix of the \u03b1I domain that has been suggested to be the mechanism by which signals are propagated in the intact integrin receptor. The structure suggests a basis for the different binding selectivity observed for the \u03b11I and \u03b12I domains. Mutational data identify residues that contribute to the conformational change observed.

BACKGROUND: The international Inherited Neuropathy Consortium (INC) was created with the goal of obtaining much needed natural history data for patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. We analysed clinical and genetic data from patients in the INC to determine the distribution of CMT subtypes and the clinical impairment associated with them. METHODS: We analysed data from 1652 patients evaluated at 13 INC centres. The distribution of CMT subtypes and pathogenic genetic mutations were determined. The disease burden of all the mutations was assessed by the CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) and CMT Examination Score (CMTES). RESULTS: 997 of the 1652 patients (60.4%) received a genetic diagnosis. The most common CMT subtypes were CMT1A/PMP22 duplication, CMT1X/GJB1 mutation, CMT2A/MFN2 mutation, CMT1B/MPZ mutation, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy/PMP22 deletion. These five subtypes of CMT accounted for 89.2% of all genetically confirmed mutations. Mean CMTNS for some but not all subtypes were similar to those previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that large numbers of patients with a representative variety of CMT subtypes have been enrolled and that the frequency of achieving a molecular diagnosis and distribution of the CMT subtypes reflects those previously reported. Measures of severity are similar, though not identical, to results from smaller series. This study confirms that it is possible to assess patients in a uniform way between international centres, which is critical for the planned natural history study and future clinical trials. These data will provide a representative baseline for longitudinal studies of CMT. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ID number NCT01193075."

BACKGROUND: Identification of protein interaction networks has received considerable attention in the post-genomic era. The currently available biochemical approaches used to detect protein-protein interactions are all time and labour intensive. Consequently there is a growing need for the development of computational tools that are capable of effectively identifying such interactions. RESULTS: Here we explain the development and implementation of a novel Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Engine termed PIPE. This tool is capable of predicting protein-protein interactions for any target pair of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins from their primary structure and without the need for any additional information or predictions about the proteins. PIPE showed a sensitivity of 61% for detecting any yeast protein interaction with 89% specificity and an overall accuracy of 75%. This rate of success is comparable to those associated with the most commonly used biochemical techniques. Using PIPE, we identified a novel interaction between YGL227W (vid30) and YMR135C (gid8) yeast proteins. This lead us to the identification of a novel yeast complex that here we term vid30 complex (vid30c). The observed interaction was confirmed by tandem affinity purification (TAP tag), verifying the ability of PIPE to predict novel protein-protein interactions. We then used PIPE analysis to investigate the internal architecture of vid30c. It appeared from PIPE analysis that vid30c may consist of a core and a secondary component. Generation of yeast gene deletion strains combined with TAP tagging analysis indicated that the deletion of a member of the core component interfered with the formation of vid30c, however, deletion of a member of the secondary component had little effect (if any) on the formation of vid30c. Also, PIPE can be used to analyse yeast proteins for which TAP tagging fails, thereby allowing us to predict protein interactions that are not included in genome-wide yeast TAP tagging projects. CONCLUSION: PIPE analysis can predict yeast protein-protein interactions. Also, PIPE analysis can be used to study the internal architecture of yeast protein complexes. The data also suggests that a finite set of short polypeptide signals seem to be responsible for the majority of the yeast protein-protein interactions."

Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant in the world for patients with venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, chronic atrial fibrillation, and prosthetic heart valves. Approximately 30 genes contribute to therapeutic effects of warfarin, and genetic polymorphisms in these genes may modulate its anticoagulant activity. In contrast to monogenic pharmacogenetic traits, warfarin drug response is a polygenic trait, and development of diagnostic tools predictive of adverse reactions to warfarin requires a novel approach. A combination of two strategies, biochemical isolation of allelic variants and linkage disequilibrium association studies, was used to find an association between genetic polymorphisms in the candidate genes and warfarin response. A strong association was found between genetic polymorphisms in six genes, including VKORC1, CYP2C9, PROC, EPHX1, GGCX, and ORM1, and interindividual variability in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin; the strongest predictors were VKORC1 and CYP2C9. Generation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based dense genetic maps made it possible to identify haplotypes associated with drugresponse phenotypes. Discrimination between haplotypes associated with warfarin dose phenotypes can be achieved by a limited set of informative polymorphisms (tag SNPs). The use of tag SNPs in pharmacogenomic analysis provides a promising tool for dissecting polygenic traits of drug response."

The primary endpoints were objective response rate and change in tumor growth rate. Progression-free survival, overall survival, metabolic response, biomarker, and quality of life were secondary endpoints.Results: Of 34 evaluable patients, 2 (6%) had a partial response and 22 (65%) had stable disease >4 months. Median PFS was 8.2 months and OS was 20.6 months. The slope of the overall TGR fell from 1.95 to 0.63 on treatment (P < 0.001). Toxicity was moderate; 63% of patients developed grade 3-4 toxicity, 94% required dose modifications, and 21% stopped treatment early. An early metabolic response based on FDG-PET scans was seen in 3 of 15 patients but did not correlate with RECIST response. MYB gene translocation was observed and significantly correlated with overexpression of MYB but did not correlate with FGFR1 phosphorylation or clinical response to dovitinib.Conclusions: Dovitinib produced few objective responses in patients with ACC but did suppress the TGR with a PFS that compares favorably with those reported with other targeted agents. Future studies of more potent and selective FGFR inhibitors in biomarker-selected patients will be required to determine whether FGFR signaling is a valid therapeutic target in ACC.

We have investigated the possibility that calsequestrin is a luminal calcium concentration sensor for the ryanodine receptor. We measured the luminal calcium concentration at which calsequestrin dissociates from the ryanodine receptor and the effect of calsequestrin on the response of the ryanodine receptor to changes in luminal calcium. We provide electrophysiological and biochemical evidence that: 1), luminal calcium concentration of >/=4 mM dissociates calsequestrin from junctional face membrane, whereas in the range of 1-3 mM calsequestrin remains attached; 2), the association with calsequestrin inhibits ryanodine receptor activity, but amplifies its response to changes in luminal calcium concentration; and 3), under physiological calcium conditions (1 mM), phosphorylation of calsequestrin does not alter its ability to inhibit native ryanodine receptor activity when the anchoring proteins triadin and junctin are present. These data suggest that the quaternary complex is intact in vivo, and provides further evidence that calsequestrin is involved in the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling pathway and has a role as a luminal calcium sensor for the ryanodine receptor."

METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

RESULTS: The 7-day and 90-day risks of stroke in the present case series (n = 148) were 8% (95% CI 4%-12%) and 16% (95% CI 10%-22%). The ABCD(2) score accurately discriminated between TIA patients with high 7-day (c statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.88) and 90-day (c statistic 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.86) risks of stroke. The 90-day risk of stroke was 7-fold higher in patients with an ABCD(2) score >3 points (28%, 95% CI 18%-38%) than in patients with an ABCD(2) score < or = 3 points (4%, 95% CI 0%-9%). After adjustment for stroke risk factors, race, history of previous TIA, medication use before the index TIA and secondary prevention treatment strategies, an ABCD(2) score of >2 was associated with a nearly 5-fold greater 90-day risk of stroke (hazard ratio 4.65, 95% CI 1.04-20.84, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Our findings externally validate the usefulness of the ABCD(2) score in triaging TIA patients with a high risk of early stroke in a multiethnic sample of hospitalized patients. The present data support current guidelines endorsing the immediate hospitalization of patients with an ABCD(2) score >2."

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma. We examined the role of PCDH10 as a mediator of medulloblastoma cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. METHODS: We identified a focal homozygous deletion of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma by surveying a cohort of 212 tumours by Affymetrix SNP array analysis. PCDH10 expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in a series of 26 tumours. The promoter methylation status of PCDH10 was determined using methylation specific PCR and Sequenom MassCLEAVE analysis. Functional studies examining the role of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma development were performed by re-expression of PCDH10 in the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, and then, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell migration assays were performed. RESULTS: We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3 harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other mechanisms also could be involved in gene repression. We found that DNA hypermethylation contributed to the deregulation of PCDH10 in 11/44 (25%) of medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumours. Using a stable cell line (DAOY) re-expressing PCDH10, we observed that cell migration was impaired upon restoration of PCDH10 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby contributing to medulloblastoma progression."

In this paper, we present a case of Meigs' syndrome associated with increased CA125 level due to ovarian fibroma / thecoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year old Iranian woman presented with fever, abdominal pain and distention and in imaging assessment, a 90\u00d7109 mm heterogeneous pelvic mass with free abdominopelvic fluid was reported. Pleural effusion was detected in CXR. Aspiration of ascetic fluid showed no evidence of malignancy. CA125 level was greater than 600 IU/mL. The patient went under laparotomy in which a 120\u00d7100 mm mass was detected in her left adnexa attached to colon, bowels and bottom of pelvis. Histology reported ovarian fibro/ thecoma. The mass was resected and after that, the symptoms disappeared and CA125 level reached to 15 IU/mL. The patient had no problem after 18 months of follow up. CONCLUSION: Meigs' syndrome should be considered at the differential diagnosis for a patient with pelvic mass, pleural effusion and ascites with normal cytology, increased CA125 levels."

Potential non-interactions were identified by a modified version of Excerbt, a text mining tool based on semantic sentence analysis. Manual verification shows that nearly a half of the text mining results with the highest confidence values correspond to NIP pairs.

PURPOSE: To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. METHODS: Patients underwent detailed ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal examination. This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae. Echocardiography and skeletal examination revealed no sign of systemic disorders associated with EL, in particular Marfan syndrome (MFS). Nine patients (52.9%) were found to have mutations in ADAMTSL4, including four novel nonsense mutations. Four patients (25%) were found to have novel FBN1 mutations, not previously reported as causing classical Marfan syndrome. One additional patient was found to have an FBN1 mutation previously reported in classical MFS. Four patients (25%) were found to have no mutations in either gene. Median age of diagnosis of EL was 35 years in patients with FBN1 mutations and 2 years in patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations (P < 0.01). Mean axial length was 22.74 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.3-24.2) (FBN1) and 27.54 mm (95% CI: 24.2-30.9) (ADAMTSL4) (P < 0.01). Other ophthalmic features, including corneal thickness and power, foveal thickness, visual acuity, and direction of lens displacement, were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene."

Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of protein Ser/ Thr kinases, which play important roles in signal transduction required for cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress response and adaptation. It is also known that some prokaryotes contain a family of protein Ser/Thr kinases. A major challenge in the characterization of these kinases is how to identify their specific substrates. Here we developed such a method using a protein Ser/Thr kinase, Pkn2 from Myxococcus xanthus, a Gram-negative soil bacterium. When Pkn2 is inducibly expressed in E. coli, cells are unable to form colonies on agar plates. This lethal effect of Pkn2 was eliminated in an inactive Pkn2 mutant in which the highly conserved Lys residue was changed to Asn, indicating that phosphorylation of a cellular protein(s) in E. coli resulted in growth arrest. Several clones from an E. coli genomic library were found to suppress the lethal effect when co-expressed with pkn2. Four out of seven multi-copy suppressors were identified to encode HU, (3 for HUalpha and 1 for HUB) a histone-like DNA binding protein. Purified HUalpha was found to be specifically phosphorylated by Pkn2 at Thr-59, and the phosphorylated HUalpha became unable to bind to DNA, suggesting that the phosphorylation of endogenous HU proteins by Pkn2 contributed at least in part to the lethal effect in E. coli. The present method termed the STEK method (Suppressors of Toxic Effects of Kinases) may be widely used for the substrate identification not only for prokaryotic protein Ser/Thr kinases but also for eukaryotic kinases."

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Heterozygous activating mutations in KCNJ11, which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, cause both permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. A minority of patients also have neurological features. The identification of a KCNJ11 mutation has important therapeutic implications, as many patients can replace insulin injections with sulfonylurea tablets. We aimed to determine the age of presentation of patients with KCNJ11 mutations and to examine if there was a relationship between genotype and phenotype. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: KCNJ11 was sequenced in 239 unrelated patients from 21 countries, who were diagnosed with permanent diabetes before 2 years of age. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the 120 patients (26%) diagnosed in the first 26 weeks of life had a KCNJ11 mutation; no mutations were found in the 119 cases (0%) diagnosed after this age. Fourteen different heterozygous mutations were identified, with the majority resulting from de novo mutations. These include seven novel mutations: H46Y, R50Q, G53D C166Y, K170T, L164P and Y330S. All 11 probands with the most common mutation, R201H, had isolated diabetes. In contrast, developmental delay in addition to diabetes was seen in four of five probands with the V59M mutation and two of four with the R201C mutation. Five patients with developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome had unique mutations not associated with other phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: KCNJ11 mutations are a common cause of permanent diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months and all patients diagnosed in this age group should be tested. There is a strong genotype-phenotype relationship with the mutation being an important determinant of associated neurological features."

          "context": "Relevance of GC content to the conservation of DNA polymerase III/mismatch repair system in Gram-positive bacteria. The mechanism of DNA replication is one of the driving forces of genome evolution. Bacterial DNA polymerase III, the primary complex of DNA replication, consists of PolC and DnaE. PolC is conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, especially in the Firmicutes with low GC content, whereas DnaE is widely conserved in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. PolC contains two domains, the 3'-5'exonuclease domain and the polymerase domain, while DnaE only possesses the polymerase domain. Accordingly, DnaE does not have the proofreading function; in Escherichia coli, another enzyme DnaQ performs this function. In most bacteria, the fidelity of DNA replication is maintained by 3'-5' exonuclease and a mismatch repair (MMR) system. However, we found that most Actinobacteria (a group of Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content) appear to have lost the MMR system and chromosomes may be replicated by DnaE-type DNA polymerase III with DnaQ-like 3'-5' exonuclease. We tested the mutation bias of Bacillus subtilis, which belongs to the Firmicutes and found that the wild type strain is AT-biased while the mutS-deletant strain is remarkably GC-biased. If we presume that DnaE tends to make mistakes that increase GC content, these results can be explained by the mutS deletion (i.e., deletion of the MMR system). Thus, we propose that GC content is regulated by DNA polymerase and MMR system, and the absence of polC genes, which participate in the MMR system, may be the reason for the increase of GC content in Gram-positive bacteria such as Actinobacteria."

The preparative regimen consisted of fludarabine, Ara-C and amsacrine (FLAMSA) chemotherapy, followed by reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 3 days later. In vivo T-cell depletion by anti-thymocyte globulin was used to protect from early GvHD, and prophylactic donor lymphocyte transfusion was given from day+120 to augment the GvL effect, once tolerance was established.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial. We further evaluated the efficacy of tofacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

They play a major role in the translocation machinery, pore formation, membrane anchoring and ion exchange. TMBs are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and vaccines. Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination, computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology of TMBs are important. RESULTS: Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences, respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, BOCTOPUS performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of 87%. Further, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct number of strands for 83% proteins in the dataset. BOCTOPUS might also help in reliable identification of TMBs by using it as an additional filter to methods specialized in this task.

UNLABELLED: Triple A syndrome (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal failure, progressive neurodegenerative disease) is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene which encodes the protein alacrima achalasia adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder (ALADIN). Our investigation suggests that low bone mineral density (BMD) for age/osteoporosis could be a common but overlooked symptom of unexplained etiology in this rare multisystemic disease. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to evaluate incidence and etiology of BMD for age/osteoporosis, a possibly overlooked symptom in triple A syndrome. METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and radius, bone turnover markers, minerals, total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-OH2D), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione) were measured in five male and four female patients. RESULTS: At time of diagnosis, low BMD for age was suspected on X-ray in seven of nine patients aged 2-11\u00a0years (not performed in two patients); normal levels of minerals and ALP were found in nine patients and low levels of adrenal androgens in eight patients (not measured in one patient). Reevaluation 5-35\u00a0years after introduction of 12\u00a0mg/m(2)/day hydrocortisone showed low BMD for age in two children, osteopenia in one, and osteoporosis in six adults. Normal levels of minerals, ALP, PTH, 1,25-OH2D, procollagen type 1, crosslaps, and osteocalcin were found in all patients. Low levels of adrenal androgens were found in all and 25OHD deficiency in six patients. Body mass index was <25\u00a0% for age and sex in eight of nine patients. CONCLUSION: Low BMD for age/osteoporosis in our patients probably is not a result of glucocorticoid therapy but could be the consequence of low level of adrenal androgens, neurological impairment causing physical inactivity, inadequate sun exposure, and protein malnutrition secondary to achalasia. Considering ubiquitous ALADIN expression, low BMD/osteoporosis may be a primary phenotypic feature of the disease. Besides optimizing glucocorticoid dose, physical activity, adequate sun exposure, appropriate nutrition, and vitamin D supplementation, therapy with DHEA should be considered."

          "context": "Low-density lipoprotein apheresis: an evidence-based analysis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis performed with the heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP) system for the treatment of patients with refractory homozygous (HMZ) and heterozygous (HTZ) familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). BACKGROUND ON FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by several mutations in the LDL-receptor gene. The reduced number or absence of functional LDL receptors results in impaired hepatic clearance of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles, which results in extremely high levels of LDL-C in the bloodstream. Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by excess LDL-C deposits in tendons and arterial walls, early onset of atherosclerotic disease, and premature cardiac death. Familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in both HTZ and HMZ forms. Heterozygous FH is one of the most common monogenic metabolic disorders in the general population, occurring in approximately 1 in 500 individuals. Nevertheless, HTZ FH is largely undiagnosed and an accurate diagnosis occurs in only about 15% of affected patients in Canada. Thus, it is estimated that there are approximately 3,800 diagnosed and 21,680 undiagnosed cases of HTZ FH in Ontario. In HTZ FH patients, half of the LDL receptors do not work properly or are absent, resulting in plasma LDL-C levels 2- to 3-fold higher than normal (range 7-15mmol/L or 300-500mg/dL). Most HTZ FH patients are not diagnosed until middle age when either they or one of their siblings present with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Without lipid-lowering treatment, 50% of males die before the age of 50 and 25% of females die before the age of 60, from myocardial infarction or sudden death. In contrast to the HTZ form, HMZ FH is rare (occurring in 1 case per million persons) and more severe, with a 6- to 8-fold elevation in plasma LDL-C levels (range 15-25mmol/L or 500-1000mg/dL). Homozygous FH patients are typically diagnosed in infancy, usually due to the presence of cholesterol deposits in the skin and tendons. The main complication of HMZ FH is supravalvular aortic stenosis, which is caused by cholesterol deposits on the aortic valve and in the ascending aorta. The average life expectancy of affected individuals is 23 to 25 years. In Ontario, it is estimated that there are 13 to 15 cases of HMZ FH. An Ontario clinical expert confirmed that 9 HMZ FH patients have been identified to date. DIAGNOSIS: There are 2 accepted clinical diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of FH: the Simon Broome FH Register criteria from the United Kingdom and the Dutch Lipid Network criteria from the Netherlands. The criterion supplement cholesterol levels with clinical history, physical signs and family history. DNA-based-mutation-screening methods permit a definitive diagnosis of HTZ FH to be made. However, given that there are over 1000 identified mutations in the LDL receptor gene and that the detection rates of current techniques are low, genetic testing becomes problematic in countries with high genetic heterogeneity, such as Canada. TREATMENT: The primary aim of treatment in both HTZ and HMZ FH is to reduce plasma LDL-C levels in order to reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis and CAD. The first line of treatment is dietary intervention, however it alone is rarely sufficient for the treatment of FH patients. Patients are frequently treated with lipid-lowering drugs such as resins, fibrates, niacin, statins and cholesterol absorption-inhibiting drugs (ezetimibe). Most HTZ FH patients require a combination of drugs to achieve or approach target cholesterol levels. A small number of HTZ FH patients are refractory to treatment or intolerant to lipid-lowering medication. According to clinical experts, the prevalence of refractory HTZ FH in Ontario is between 1 to 5%. Using the mean of 3%, it is estimated that there are approximately 765 refractory HTZ FH patients in Ontario, of which 115 are diagnosed and 650 are undiagnosed. Drug therapy is less effective in HMZ FH patients since the effects of the majority of cholesterol-lowering drugs are mediated by the upregulation of LDL receptors, which are often absent or function poorly in HMZ FH patients. Some HMZ FH patients may still benefit from drug therapy, however this rarely reduces LDL-C levels to targeted levels. EXISTING TECHNOLOGY: PLASMA EXCHANGE An option currently available in Ontario for FH patients who do not respond to standard diet and drug therapy is plasma exchange (PE). Patients are treated with this lifelong therapy on a weekly or biweekly basis with concomitant drug therapy. Plasma exchange is nonspecific and eliminates virtually all plasma proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, fibrinolytic factors and HDL-C, in addition to acutely lowering LDL-C by about 50%. Blood is removed from the patient, plasma is isolated, discarded and replaced with a substitution fluid. The substitution fluid and the remaining cellular components of the blood are then returned to the patient. The major limitation of PE is its nonspecificity. The removal of HDL-C prevents successful vascular remodeling of the areas stenosed by atherosclerosis. In addition, there is an increased susceptibility to infections, and costs are incurred by the need for replacement fluid. Adverse events can be expected to occur in 12% of procedures. OTHER ALTERNATIVES: Surgical alternatives for FH patients include portocaval shunt, ileal bypass and liver transplantation. However, these are risky procedures and are associated with a high morbidity rate. Results with gene therapy are not convincing to date. THE TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: LDL APHERESIS An alternative to PE is LDL apheresis. Unlike PE, LDL apheresis is a selective treatment that removes LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins from the blood while minimally impacting other plasma components such as HDL-C, total serum protein, albumin and immunoglobulins. As with PE, FH patients require lifelong therapy with LDL apheresis on a weekly/biweekly basis with concomitant drug therapy. HEPARIN-INDUCED EXTRACORPOREAL LDL PRECIPITATION: Heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP) is one of the most widely used methods of LDL apheresis. It is a continuous closed-loop system that processes blood extracorporeally. It operates on the principle that at a low pH, LDL and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] bind to heparin and fibrinogen to form a precipitate which is then removed by filtration. In general, the total duration of treatment is approximately 2 to 3 hours. Results from early trials indicate that LDL-C concentration is reduced by 65% to 70% immediately following treatment in both HMZ and HTZ FH and then rapidly begins to rise. Typically patients with HTZ FH are treated every 2 weeks while patients with HMZ FH require weekly therapy. Heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL precipitation also produces small transient decreases in HDL-C, however levels generally return to baseline within 2 days. After several months of therapy, long-term reductions in LDL-C and increases in HDL-C have been reported. In addition to having an impact on plasma cholesterol concentrations, HELP lowers plasma fibrinogen, a risk factor for atherosclerosis, and reduces concentrations of cellular adhesion molecules, which play a role in early atherogenesis. In comparison with PE, HELP LDL apheresis does not have major effects on essential plasma proteins and does not require replacement fluid, thus decreasing susceptibility to infections. One study noted that adverse events were documented in 2.9% of LDL apheresis treatments using the HELP system compared with 12% using PE. As per the manufacturer, patients must weigh at least 30kgs to be eligible for treatment with HELP. REGULATORY STATUS: The H.E.L.P.\u00ae System (B.Braun Medizintechnologie GmbH, Germany) has been licensed by Health Canada since December 2000 as a Class 3 medical device (Licence # 26023) for performing LDL apheresis to acutely remove LDL from the plasma of 3 high-risk patient populations for whom diet has been ineffective and maximum drug therapy has either been ineffective or not tolerated. The 3 patient groups are as follows: Functional hypercholesterolemic homozygotes with LDL-C >500 mg/dL (>13mmol/L);Functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygotes with LDL-C >300 mg/dL (>7.8mmol/L);Functional hypercholesterolemic heterozygotes with LDL-C >200 mg/dL (>5.2mmol/L) and documented CADNo other LDL apheresis system is currently licensed in Canada. REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat systematically reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness and safety of LDL apheresis performed with the HELP system for the treatment of patients with refractory HMZ and HTZ FH. A standard search methodology was used to retrieve international health technology assessments and English-language journal articles from selected databases. The GRADE approach was used to systematically and explicitly make judgments about the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The search identified 398 articles published from January 1, 1998 to May 30, 2007. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Five case series, 2 case series nested within comparative studies, and one retrospective review, were included in the analysis. A health technology assessment conducted by the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, and a review by the United States Food and Drug Administration were also included. Large heterogeneity among the studies was observed. Studies varied in inclusion criteria, baseline patient characteristics and methodology. Overall, the mean acute relative decrease in LDL-C with HELP LDL apheresis ranged from 53 to 77%. The mean acute relative reductions ranged as follows: total cholesterol (TC) 47 to 64%, HDL-C +0.

The post-translational conversion of peptidylarginine to peptidylcitrulline, a process also known as citrullination, is catalyzed by the enzyme family of peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) and has been demonstrated to be involved in many physiological processes, including the regulation of gene expression. In addition, citrullination has been shown to be associated with several diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. To get more insight into the role of PAD enzymes and citrullination in both health and disease, experimental strategies to study PAD activity and to characterize citrullinated proteins in complex biological samples are crucial. Here, we describe the chemical, proteomic and antibody-based procedures that are currently available and discuss their applicability for the analysis of complex samples. The methods that have been developed can be used to provide more insight in the substrate specificity of PAD enzymes. Because the evidence that PADs play a pathophysiological role in the diseases mentioned above is increasing, they become attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. More knowledge of PAD specificity and the availability of reliable, high-throughput assays for PAD activity will facilitate the development of highly specific PAD inhibitors."

They are present in the form of specialized organs, such as the pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, and adrenal gland, or in the form of the diffuse neuroendocrine system in the respiratory and digestive tracts. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, yet they present certain unifying features. These include frequent hormonal overproduction that leads to specific symptoms and a typical immunohistochemical staining profile with chromogranin A and synaptophysin reactivity. Over the past decades, many neuroendocrine tumors have been described in the context of heritable tumor syndromes, and there exist several syndromes that are almost entirely composed of neuroendocrine tumors. Tumors occurring as part of these hereditary syndromes are characterized by specific genetic abnormalities that have helped our understanding of tumorigenesis, and they frequently appear at a young age. It is therefore important for the pediatric pathologist to be aware of specific histologic characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors in childhood and of their association with specific tumor syndromes.

          "context": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis in Children. Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses. Prophylaxis guidelines are restricted to infants born before 29 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, and infants and children with hemodynamically significant heart disease."

Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are known to be shuttled between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, thereby several lysosomal hydrolases are delivered through the endocytic pathway into lysosomes. This interorganellar transport is mediated by transport intermediates, now called transport carriers. Previous studies employing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based live-cell imaging demonstrated that these transport carriers are pleiomorphic structures composed of tubular and vesicular elements. Introducing a time-axis into light microscopic observations enabled us to identify transport carriers that are derived from or targeted at a distinct organelle. In this study, we describe several methods for the observation of GFP-tagged MPRs. Photobleaching the peripheral region of a cell before a time-lapse observation allows us to monitor TGN-derived transport carriers for longer periods (more than 4min). Events of their targeting into endosomes can be visualized by dual-color imaging of both GFP-MPRs and fluorescently tagged transferrin that is internalized by cells. By using a technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we can analyze overall cycling kinetics of MPRs in a single cell. Transport of MPRs is regulated by several cytosolic factors like clathrin adaptors, AP1, and GGAs. The adaptors on the TGN membranes are exchanging with their cytosolic pool, which can also be analyzed by FRAP. In addition, the relationships of the MPR-containing transport carriers that left the TGN and the adaptors can be visualized by dual-color imaging. A similar system of membrane transport and its regulation is well documented in drosophila cells. As Drosophila melanogaster has only a single MPR (LERP), AP1, or GGA, it is an ideal model system for the understanding of specific functions of each cytosolic factor. To visualize these molecules in drosophila cells, however, we need to consider that multiple Golgi dots exist scattered in the cytoplasm. Thus, the Golgi dots or endosomes should be identified before live-cell imaging."

Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, used to regulate cell fate decisions. Four Notch receptors have been identified in man (Notch-1 to -4). In this study, semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression pattern of Notch receptor genes in whole adult human liver and isolated liver cell preparations. All 4 receptors were expressed in the adult liver, with no significant differences in the levels of Notch-1, -2, and -4 messenger RNA (mRNA) between normal and diseased liver. However, Notch-3 expression appeared to be increased in diseased tissue. The distribution of Notch-1 and -4 in normal tissue was similar, with Notch-1 also detectable at low levels in the sinusoidal endothelium. Notch-2 expression was more widely distributed, and detectable in hepatocytes, medium-sized bile ducts, and the sinusoidal endothelium. Notch-3 expression was seen on hepatocytes, with weaker expression detectable in portal veins, hepatic arteries, and the sinusoids. In normal liver tissue Notch-1, -2, and -3 were found to be coexpressed on bile duct epithelium; however, with the exception of Notch-3 in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) livers, expression was absent on proliferating ductules in all disease states examined. Interestingly, the expression of Notch-2 and -3 was associated with numerous small vessels within the portal tract septa of diseased tissue. The absence of Notch receptor expression on proliferating bile ductules and its presence on neovessels suggests that Notch signaling may be important for normal bile duct formation and the aberrant neovascularization seen in diseased liver tissue."

BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an idiopathic steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease that represents an important cause of stroke. However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3."

Interleukin-5 is a Th2 homodimeric cytokine involved in the differentiation, maturation, migration, development, survival, trafficking and effector function of blood and local tissue eosinophils, in addition to basophils and mast cells. The IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) consists of an IL-5-specific \u03b1 subunit that interacts in conformationally dynamic ways with the receptor's \u03b2c subunit, an aggregate of domains it shares with binding sites of IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IL-5 and IL-5R drive allergic and inflammatory immune responses characterizing numerous diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, hyper-eosinophilic syndrome, Churg-Strauss syndrome and eosinophilic nasal polyposis. Although corticosteroid therapy is the primary treatment for these diseases, a substantial number of patients exhibit incomplete responses and suffer side-effects. Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). Both antibodies have demonstrated the ability to reduce blood and tissue eosinophil counts. One additional monoclonal antibody, benralizumab (MEDI-563), has been developed to target IL-5R and attenuate eosinophilia through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. All three monoclonal antibodies are being clinically evaluated. Antisense oligonucleotide technology targeting the common \u03b2c IL-5R subunit is also being used therapeutically to inhibit IL-5-mediated effects (TPI ASM8). Small interfering RNA technology has also been used therapeutically to inhibit the expression of IL-5 in animal models. This review summarizes the structural interactions between IL-5 and IL-5R and the functional consequences of such interactions, and describes the pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting IL-5R as a therapeutic target."

RNAP II did not interact with any of several PSTVd (-) RNAs tested. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of a shortened model PSTVd (+) RNA fragment were used to identify the role of specific nucleotides and structural motifs in this interaction. Our results provide evidence for the interaction of a RNAP II complex from a natural host with the rod-like conformation of the left terminal domain of PSTVd (+) RNA."

Ras/Raf-prototypic oncogenes induce cellular senescence, a terminal cell-cycle arrest, as a default cellular safeguard program, while oncogenic Myc is known to rather promote apoptosis as the prime failsafe mechanism. We review and discuss here evidence for Myc-induced senescence - which is detectable to a limited degree as a cell-autonomous, direct response to Myc action, but occurs predominantly in a non-cell-autonomous fashion via crosstalk of the oncogene-driven cell population with non-neoplastic bystanders, namely cells of the host immune system, prompting them to release pro-senescent cytokines that strike back onto adjacent proliferating tumor cells. In particular, we discuss how Myc-evoked apoptosis serves as a signal for macrophage attraction and activation, followed by the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 as a cytokine that is capable of terminally arresting Myc-driven lymphoma cells without causing further DNA damage and without launching a senescence-associated, pro-inflammatory, and, therefore, potentially detrimental cytokine response in the target population. In essence, non-cell-autonomous but still oncogene-orchestrated senescence is a functionally relevant, robustly tumor-suppressive principle with critical implications for conceptually novel anti-cancer therapies in the clinic."

The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases play a critical role in host-mediated defense against exogenous viruses, most notably, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and endogenous transposable elements. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F interact with numerous proteins that regulate cellular RNA metabolism, including components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and colocalize with a subset of these proteins to mRNA processing bodies (P bodies), which are sites of mRNA translational repression and decay. We sought to determine the role of P bodies and associated proteins in HIV-1 replication and APOBEC3 antiviral activity. While we established a positive correlation between APOBEC3 protein incorporation into virions and localization to P bodies, depletion of the P-body components DDX6 or Lsm1 did not affect HIV-1 replication, APOBEC3 packaging into virions or APOBEC3 protein mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. In addition, neither HIV-1 genomic RNA nor Gag colocalized with P-body proteins. However, simultaneous depletion of multiple Argonaute family members, the effector proteins of RISC, could modestly increase viral infectivity. Because some APOBEC3 proteins interact with several Argonaute proteins, we also tested whether they could modulate microRNA (miRNA) activity. We found no evidence for the specific regulation of miRNA function by the APOBEC3 proteins, though more general effects on transfected gene expression were observed. In sum, our results indicate that P bodies and certain associated proteins do not regulate HIV-1 replication or APOBEC3 protein antiviral activity. Localization to P bodies may therefore provide a means of sequestering APOBEC3 enzymatic activity away from cellular DNA or may be linked to as yet unidentified cellular functions."

As new therapies are being developed to counter A. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. Here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. The model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. A 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. Uninoculated control wounds healed within 13 days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days. Treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16S rRNA community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. The range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. The model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. Ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals."

A mutation in histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of histamine (HA), has been implicated as a rare genetic cause. Hdc knockout mice exhibited potentiated tic-like stereotypies, recapitulating core phenomenology of TS; these were mitigated by the dopamine (DA) D2 antagonist haloperidol, a proven pharmacotherapy, and by HA infusion into the brain. Prepulse inhibition was impaired in both mice and humans carrying Hdc mutations. HA infusion reduced striatal DA levels; in Hdc knockout mice, striatal DA was increased and the DA-regulated immediate early gene Fos was upregulated. DA D2/D3 receptor binding was altered both in mice and in humans carrying the Hdc mutation. These data confirm histidine decarboxylase deficiency as a rare cause of TS and identify HA-DA interactions in the basal ganglia as an important locus of pathology."

Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine. MAOA also plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations, affective disturbances, and poor concentration. Two hundred seventy five Korean schizophrenia patients and 289 control subjects were recruited. Three SNPs [rs6323 (Arg294Arg), rs1137070 (Asp470Asp), and rs3027407 (3'-untranslated region)] of the MAOA gene were selected and genotyped by direct sequencing. The common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia according to the Operation Criteria Checklist were analyzed. Three examined SNPs showed no associations with male and female schizophrenia, respectively (p>0.05). In the analysis of the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia patients, three examined SNPs were associated with affective disturbances, especially restricted affect and blunted affect in male schizophrenia, respectively (restricted affect, p=0.002, OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.45-5.00; blunted affect, p=0.009, OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.22-4.12). The SNPs were not associated with other clinical symptoms of schizophrenia (persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations, and poor concentration). These results suggest that exonic SNPs (rs6323, rs1137070, and rs3027407) of the MAOA gene may be contributed to affective disturbances of Korean males schizophrenia, especially restricted affect and blunted affect."

PURPOSE: This study examines the relationship between low back pain, disability and fatigue and overt physical activity with respect to fear-avoidance and endurance-related subgroups. METHOD: 49 patients completed questionnaires (Pain, Disability, Fatigue, Depression, Pain-responses pattern) 6 months after lumbar disc surgery and underwent an 8-hour accelerometer assessment measuring overall physical activity (PAL), constant strain postures (CSP), standing time (ST) and lying time (LT). Four subgroups, representing patterns of distress-endurance (DER), eustress-endurance (EER), fear-avoidance (FAR) and adaptive responses (AR) due to the avoidance-endurance model of pain-regulation were investigated. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of covariance revealed significantly higher pain, disability and fatigue in FAR compared to AR patients and, as expected lower PAL and CSP in FAR than in endurance patients. Both endurance groups revealed higher pain accompanied by higher accelerometer-based physical activity (PAL, CSP) than AR and FAR patients. Most of the subgroup differences displayed moderate to high effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate different pathways to chronic pain and disability with physical underuse in FAR patients and overuse/overload in endurance patients suggesting the need for individually targeted cognitive-behavioral treatments in the maladaptive groups. Implications for Rehabilitation Improving the return to a normal physical activity level is an important goal for the rehabilitation of patients after lumbar disc surgery. Different pathways to chronic pain and disability with physical underuse in fear-avoidance patients and overuse in endurance patients should be considered. Different pain-related pain response pattern, based on the avoidance-endurance model, indicate the need for individual targeting of rehabilitation programs."

Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like flushing. The flushing improved with steroid therapy, as did some of the other clinical features of her disease.

Generation of new blood vessels from existing vessels was promoted 2- to 3-fold by either T(4) or T(3) at 10(-8)-10(-7) M total hormone concentrations. In the present studies, nanomolar concentrations of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotropic properties, exhibited potent proangiogenic activity that was comparable to that obtained with T(3) and T(4) in both the CAM model and in an in vitro three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting assay. The proangiogenesis effect of DITPA was inhibited by tetraiodothyroacetic acid, a thyroid hormone analog that competes with T(4) and T(3) for a novel cell surface hormone receptor site on integrin alphavbeta3. The thyroid hormone analogs DITPA, T(4), and T(4)-agarose, as well as basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, demonstrated comparable proangiogenic effects in the CAM model and in the three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting model. The proangiogenesis effect of either DITPA or b-FGF was blocked by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade. Additionally, a specific integrin alphavbeta3 small molecule antagonist, XT199, effectively inhibited the proangiogenesis effect of DITPA and b-FGF. Thus, the proangiogenesis actions of thyroid hormone and its analog DITPA are initiated at the plasma membrane, apparently at integrin alphavbeta3, and are MAPK dependent."

Human APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) inhibit the replication of Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 Vif overcomes these host restriction factors by binding to them and inducing their degradation. Thus, the Vif-A3G and Vif-A3F interactions are attractive targets for antiviral drug development, as inhibiting these interactions could allow the host defense mechanism to control HIV-1 replication. Recently, it has been reported that amino acids 105 to 156 of A3G are involved in the interaction with Vif; however, to date, the region of A3F involved in Vif binding has not been identified. Using our previously reported Vif mutants that are capable of binding to only A3G (3G binder) or only A3F (3F binder), in conjunction with a series of A3G-A3F chimeras, we have now mapped the APOBEC3-Vif interaction domains. We found that the A3G domain that interacts with the Vif YRHHY region is located between amino acids 126 and 132 of A3G, which is consistent with the conclusions reported in previous studies. The A3F domain that interacts with the Vif DRMR region did not occur in the homologous domain but instead was located between amino acids 283 and 300 of A3F. These studies are the first to identify the A3F domain that interacts with the Vif DRMR region and show that distinct domains of A3G and A3F interact with different Vif regions. Pharmacological inhibition of either or both of these Vif-A3 interactions should prevent the degradation of the APOBEC3 proteins and could be used as a therapy against HIV-1."

H-ras, N-ras, and K-ras are canonical ras gene family members frequently activated by point mutation in human cancers and coding for 4 different, highly related protein isoforms (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B). Their expression is nearly ubiquitous and broadly conserved across eukaryotic species, although there are quantitative and qualitative differences of expression depending on the tissue and/or developmental stage under consideration. Extensive functional studies have determined during the last quarter century that these Ras gene products are critical components of signaling pathways that control eukaryotic cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, because of their homology and frequent coexpression in various cellular contexts, it remained unclear whether the different Ras proteins play specific or overlapping functional roles in physiological and pathological processes. Initially, their high degree of sequence homology and the observation that all Ras isoforms share common sets of downstream effectors and upstream activators suggested that they were mostly redundant functionally. In contrast, the notion of functional specificity for each of the different Ras isoforms is supported at present by an increasing body of experimental observations, including 1) the fact that different ras isoforms are preferentially mutated in specific types of tumors or developmental disorders; 2) the different transforming potential of transfected ras genes in different cell contexts; 3) the distinct sensitivities exhibited by the various Ras family members for modulation by different GAPs or GEFs; 4) the demonstration that different Ras isoforms follow distinct intracellular processing pathways and localize to different membrane microdomains or subcellular compartments; 5) the different phenotypes displayed by genetically modified animal strains for each of the 3 ras loci; and 6) the specific transcriptional networks controlled by each isoform in different cellular settings."

The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. It is associated with cancer, particularly small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), in 50-60% of LEMS patients; the nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Non-tumor LEMS has a strong association with HLA-DR3-B8. In approximately 15% of LEMS patients, no anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies are found, suggesting recognition of other targets(s). The VGCC-associated protein synaptotagmin could be one candidate, because it acts as an exocytotic calcium receptor, is implicated in fast ACh release; its N-terminus is exposed extracellularly during exocytosis and it is expressed in SCLC. Antibodies against synaptotagmin-1 were detected in both anti-VGCC-positive and -negative LEMS patients (20%), and it can be immunogenic, allowing induction of an animal model of LEMS. Another candidate target is the M1-type presynaptic muscarinic ACh receptor (M1 mAChR), also expressed extracellularly on motor nerve terminals; it modulates cholinergic transmission, linking to P/Q-type VGCC. In our series of 25 LEMS patients with and without SCLC, anti-M1 mAChR antibodies were prevalent in both anti-VGCC-positive and -negative LEMS patients. Autonomic symptoms seemed more frequent in the latter; serum from one of them passively transferred LEMS-type electrophysiological defects to mice. As a compensatory mechanism, researchers in Oxford suggested a shift in the dependence of ACh release from the P/Q-type to other types of VGCC. We have also focused on G protein-coupled mAChRs and neurotrophins, which may affect both P/Q-type VGCC and clathrin-independent \"kiss-and-run\" synaptic vesicle recycling (fast-mode of endocytosis) via protein kinase C activation. We hypothesize that these signaling cascades help to compensate for the immune-mediated defects in calcium entry in LEMS, compensation that may frequently be restricted by the coincident anti-M1 mAChR antibodies in this disease."

BACKGROUND: The melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene regulates human pigmentation and is highly polymorphic in populations of European origins. The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between MC1R variants and the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and to investigate whether risk estimates differed by phenotypic characteristics. METHODS: Data on 3527 NMSC cases and 9391 controls were gathered through the M-SKIP Project, an international pooled-analysis on MC1R, skin cancer and phenotypic characteristics. We calculated summary odds ratios (SOR) with random-effect models, and performed stratified analyses. RESULTS: Subjects carrying at least one MC1R variant had an increased risk of NMSC overall, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): SOR (95%CI) were 1.48 (1.24-1.76), 1.39 (1.15-1.69) and 1.61 (1.35-1.91), respectively. All of the investigated variants showed positive associations with NMSC, with consistent significant results obtained for V60L, D84E, V92M, R151C, R160W, R163Q and D294H: SOR (95%CI) ranged from 1.42 (1.19-1.70) for V60L to 2.66 (1.06-6.65) for D84E variant. In stratified analysis, there was no consistent pattern of association between MC1R and NMSC by skin type, but we consistently observed higher SORs for subjects without red hair. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled-analysis highlighted a role of MC1R variants in NMSC development and suggested an effect modification by red hair colour phenotype."

The columns were extensively washed with low ionic strength buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 1M sodium chloride.

The growth inhibition and pro-apoptosis effects of dracorhodin perchlorate on human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line were examined. After administration of 10-80 \u03bcmol/L dracorhodin perchlorate for 12-48 h, cell viability of PC-3 cells was measured by MTT colorimetry. Cell proliferation ability was detected by colony formation assay. Cellular apoptosis was inspected by acridine orange-ethidium bromide fluorescent staining, Hoechst 33258 fluorescent staining, and flow cytometry (FCM) with annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide dual staining. The results showed that dracorhodin perchlorate inhibited the growth of PC-3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. IC50 of dracorhodin perchlorate on PC-3 cells at 24 h was 40.18 \u03bcmol/L. Cell clone formation rate was decreased by 86% after treatment with 20 \u03bcmol/L of dracorhodin perchlorate. Some cells presented the characteristic apoptotic changes. The cellular apoptotic rates induced by 10-40 \u03bcmol/L dracorhodin perchlorate for 24 h were 8.43% to 47.71% respectively. It was concluded that dracorhodin perchlorate significantly inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells by suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of the cells."

Generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from somatic cells has been successfully achieved by ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, also known as the Yamanaka factors. In practice, initial iPS colonies are picked based on their embryonic stem (ES) cell-like morphology, but often may go on to fail subsequent assays, such as the alkaline phosphate (AP) assay. In this study, we co-expressed through lenti-viral delivery the Yamanaka factors in amniotic fluid-derived (AF) cells. ES-like colonies were picked onto a traditional feeder layer and a high percentage AF-iPS with partial to no AP activity was found. Interestingly, we obtained an overwhelming majority of fully stained AP positive (AP+) AF-iPS colonies when colonies were first seeded on a feeder-free culture system, and then transferred to a feeder layer for expansion. Furthermore, colonies with no AP activity were not detected. This screening step decreased the variation seen between morphology and AP assay. We observed the AF-iPS colonies grown on the feeder layer with 28% AP+ colonies, 45% AP partially positive (AP+/-) colonies and 27% AP negative (AP-) colonies, while colonies screened by the feeder-free system were 84% AP+ colonies, 16% AP+/- colonies and no AP- colonies. The feeder-free screened AP+ AF-iPS colonies were also positive for pluripotent markers, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 as well as having differentiation abilities into three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we report a simplistic, one-step method for selection of AP+ AF-iPS cells via feeder-free screening."

Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes assembled by intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and they initiate innate immune responses to invading pathogens and danger signals by activating caspase-1 (ref. 1). Caspase-1 activation leads to the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18, as well as lytic inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis. Recently, a new non-canonical inflammasome was described that activates caspase-11, a pro-inflammatory caspase required for lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality. This study also highlighted that previously generated caspase-1 knockout mice lack a functional allele of Casp11 (also known as Casp4), making them functionally Casp1 Casp11 double knockouts. Previous studies have shown that these mice are more susceptible to infections with microbial pathogens, including the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), but the individual contributions of caspase-1 and caspase-11 to this phenotype are not known. Here we show that non-canonical caspase-11 activation contributes to macrophage death during S. typhimurium infection. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent interferon-\u03b2 production is crucial for caspase-11 activation in macrophages, but is only partially required for pro-caspase-11 expression, consistent with the existence of an interferon-inducible activator of caspase-11. Furthermore, Casp1(-/-) mice were significantly more susceptible to infection with S. typhimurium than mice lacking both pro-inflammatory caspases (Casp1(-/-) Casp11(-/-)). This phenotype was accompanied by higher bacterial counts, the formation of extracellular bacterial microcolonies in the infected tissue and a defect in neutrophil-mediated clearance. These results indicate that caspase-11-dependent cell death is detrimental to the host in the absence of caspase-1-mediated innate immunity, resulting in extracellular replication of a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen."

Conjoined twinning, however, only arises when the twinning event occurs at about the primitive streak stage of development, at about 13-14 days after fertilisation in the human, and is exclusively associated with the monoamniotic monochorionic type of placentation. It is believed that the highest incidence of conjoined twinning is encountered in the human. While monozygotic twinning may be induced experimentally following exposure to a variety of agents, the mechanism of induction of spontaneous twinning in the human remains unknown. All agents that are capable of acting as a twinning stimulus are teratogenic, and probably act by interfering with the spindle apparatus. DISCUSSION: The incidence of the various types of conjoined twinning is discussed. Information from the largest study to date indicates that the spontaneous incidence is about 10.25 per million births. The most common varieties encountered were thoraco-omphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18.5%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%) and craniopagus (6%). Of these, about 40% were stillborn, and 60% liveborn, although only about 25% of those that survived to birth lived long enough to be candidates for surgery. Conjoined twinning occurs by the incomplete splitting of the embryonic axis and, with the exception of parasitic conjoined twins, all are symmetrical and \"the same parts are always united to the same parts\". Fusion of monozygotic twins is no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning. Accounts are provided of the anatomical features of each of the commonly encountered varieties."

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the \"slapped cheek\" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes."

The mammalian INO80 remodelling complex facilitates homologous recombination (HR), but the mechanism by which it does this is unclear.

H2A.Z is actively incorporated at sites of damage in mammalian cells, raising the possibility that H2A.Z may need to be subsequently removed for resolution of repair. Here, we show that H2A.Z in human cells is indeed rapidly removed from chromatin flanking DNA damage by INO80. We also report that the histone chaperone ANP32E, which is implicated in removing H2AZ from chromatin, similarly promotes HR and appears to work on the same pathway as INO80 in these assays. Importantly, we demonstrate that the HR defect in cells depleted of INO80 or ANP32E can be rescued by H2A.Z co-depletion, suggesting that H2A.Z removal from chromatin is the primary function of INO80 and ANP32E in promoting homologous recombination."

In this study, we show that both the RII receptor Punt (Put) and the R-Smad Smad2 are strongly required for cell and tissue growth. Knocking down the expression of Put or Smad2 in salivary glands causes alterations in nucleolar structure and functions. Cells with decreased TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling accumulate intermediate pre-rRNA transcripts containing internal transcribed spacer 1 regions accompanied by the nucleolar retention of ribosomal proteins.

Although some promising agents are in the pipeline, there is an urgent need for new antibiotic scaffolds. However, antibacterial researchers have struggled to identify new small molecules with meaningful cellular activity, especially those effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. This difficulty ultimately stems from an incomplete understanding of efflux systems and compound permeation through bacterial membranes.

INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression via degradation or translational repression of their targeted mRNAs. It is known that aberrant microRNA expression can play important roles in cancer, but the role of microRNAs in autoimmune diseases is only beginning to emerge. In this study, the expression of selected microRNAs is examined in rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and healthy and disease control individuals, and the expression of miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, miR-16, and microRNA let-7a was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Rheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited between 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold increases in miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, and miR-16 expression, whereas let-7a expression was not significantly different compared with healthy control individuals. In addition, two targets of miR-146a, namely tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), were similarly expressed between rheumatoid arthritis patients and control individuals, despite increased expression of miR-146a in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Repression of TRAF6 and/or IRAK-1 in THP-1 cells resulted in up to an 86% reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, implicating that normal miR-146a function is critical for the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies have shown that synovial tissue and synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis exhibit increased expression of certain microRNAs. Our data thus demonstrate that microRNA expression in rheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells mimics that of synovial tissue/fibroblasts. The increased microRNA expression in rheumatoid arthritis patients is potentially useful as a marker for disease diagnosis, progression, or treatment efficacy, but this will require confirmation using a large and well defined cohort. Our data also suggest a possible mechanism contributing to rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, whereby miR-146a expression is increased but unable to properly function, leading to prolonged tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

BACKGROUND: Neurosurgeons are familiar with the challenges presented by craniopagus twins, but other types of conjoined twins may also have neurosurgical implications. We report our experience in the management of ischiopagus and pygopagus conjoined twins. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the management of conjoined twins at Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: Twenty-three pairs of symmetrical conjoined twins were managed over a 40-year period (1964-2003), of which 16 (70%) were separated. Of these cases, 6 are the focus of this study, namely 4 pairs of ischiopagus twins and 2 pairs of pygopagus twins seen between 1993 and 2003. In 2 cases, there was direct involvement of the nervous system at the site of union, with 1 pair of ischiopagi manifesting end-to-end union of their spinal cords, while a pair of pygopagi had back-to-back fusion of the conus. Another pair of ischiopagi had a fused dural sac without joined neural elements, but one of these children developed syringomyelia 2 years after separation. Neuroimaging was invaluable in detecting these abnormalities. The one pair of ischiopagi who died before separation were HIV positive and had severe brain atrophy and cystic encephalmalacia at autopsy. Nine of the 12 children (75%) had bony abnormalities of the spine remote from the area of conjunction. The most common finding was the presence of hemivertebrae, usually in the thoracic spine. Six children manifested scoliosis, which has already progressed in the oldest two. Technical aspects such as timing and sequence of separation, the division of neural tissues and reconstruction are discussed, as are the long-term complications of their spinal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Ischiopagus and pygopagus conjoined twins manifest an interesting array of spinal abnormalities, which present challenges, not only at the time of separation, but also in their long-term management."

In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites. Despite its potential importance in synaptic actions, little is known concerning the regulation of EAAC1 trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when induced. Here we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18. EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 bind to different regions of RTN2B. Each protein can separately and independently form complexes with EAAC1. RTN2B enhances ER exit and the cell surface composition of EAAC1 in heterologous cells. Expression of short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RTN2B decreases the EAAC1 protein level in neurons. Overall, our results suggest that RTN2B functions as a positive regulator in the delivery of EAAC1 from the ER to the cell surface. These studies indicate that transporter exit from the ER controlled by the interaction with its ER binding partner represents a critical regulatory step in glutamate transporter trafficking to the cell surface."

The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway is an important regulator of proinflammatory cytokine production and inflammation. Defining the roles of the various p38 family members, specifically p38alpha and p38beta, in these processes has been difficult. Here we use a chemical genetics approach using knock-in mice in which either p38alpha or p38beta kinase has been rendered resistant to the effects of specific inhibitors along with p38beta knock-out mice to dissect the biological function of these specific kinase isoforms. Mice harboring a T106M mutation in p38alpha are resistant to pharmacological inhibition of LPS-induced TNF production and collagen antibody-induced arthritis, indicating that p38beta activity is not required for acute or chronic inflammatory responses. LPS-induced TNF production, however, is still completely sensitive to p38 inhibitors in mice with a T106M point mutation in p38beta. Similarly, p38beta knock-out mice respond normally to inflammatory stimuli. These results demonstrate conclusively that specific inhibition of the p38alpha isoform is necessary and sufficient for anti-inflammatory efficacy in vivo."

METHODS: The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (N = 3,753) is a population-based study of age-related hearing loss in adults aged 48 to 92 years in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. As part of this study, infectious disease history was obtained and hearing was tested using pure-tone audiometry. Hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average of thresholds at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 2,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz greater than 25 decibels hearing level in either ear. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, only a history of diphtheria (n = 37) was associated with hearing loss (odds ratio [OR] 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 7.36). There was no relationship between hearing loss and history of chickenpox, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rheumatic fever, rubella, or scarlet fever. Only two participants with a history of diphtheria and hearing loss reported having a hearing loss before age 20. CONCLUSIONS: Diphtheria in childhood may have consequences for hearing that do not become apparent until later in life. A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway. These data may have important implications for areas facing a resurgence of diphtheria cases."

The cytotoxicity of VP-16 was almost completely antagonized by preincubating cells with nontoxic concentrations of aclarubicin. The inhibition of cytotoxicity was not seen when the cells were exposed to aclarubicin after exposure to VP-16. The inhibition was significant over a wide range of aclarubicin concentrations (3 nM to 0.4 microM), above which the toxicity of aclarubicin became apparent. A similar effect was seen on the toxicity of m-AMSA. In contrast to aclarubicin, preincubation with Adriamycin did not antagonize the effect of VP-16. With purified topoisomerase II and naked DNA, aclarubicin did not stimulate the formation of cleavable complexes between topoisomerase II and DNA. Aclarubicin concentrations above 1 microM inhibited the baseline formation of cleavable complexes elicited with the enzyme alone. Low (1 to 10 nM) aclarubicin concentrations increased the formation of cleavable complexes obtained with VP-16 and m-AMSA; however, at aclarubicin concentrations above 1 microM an antagonistic effect was obtained. In cells, the m-AMSA- and VP-16-induced, protein-concealed DNA strand breaks were completely inhibitable by aclarubicin preincubation with no synergic dose levels. Our results suggest that aclarubicin inhibits topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. This inhibition could represent the mechanism of action of the drug and explain the lack of cross-resistance to the classical anthracyclines. The observed antagonism could have consequences for scheduling of aclarubicin with topoisomerase II-active anticancer drugs."

To determine the prevalence of the disorder, we sent surveillance questionnaires to 735 core hospitals in Japan. The observed number of Emanuel syndrome cases was 36 and that of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 40. On the basis of the de novo t(11;22) translocation frequency in sperm from healthy men, we calculated the frequency of the translocations in the general population. Accordingly, the prevalence of Emanuel syndrome was estimated at 1 in 110,000. Based on this calculation, the estimated number of Emanuel syndrome cases in Japan is 1063 and of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 16,604, which are much higher than the numbers calculated from the questionnaire responses. It is possible that this discordance is partly attributable to a lack of disease identification. Further efforts should be made to increase the awareness of Emanuel syndrome to ensure a better quality of life for affected patients and their families."

We analyzed COL5A1 and COL5A2 in 126 patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of classic EDS. In 93 patients, a type V collagen defect was found, of which 73 were COL5A1 mutations, 13 were COL5A2 mutations and seven were COL5A1 null-alleles with mutation unknown. The majority of the 73 COL5A1 mutations generated a COL5A1 null-allele, whereas one-third were structural mutations, scattered throughout COL5A1. All COL5A2 mutations were structural mutations. Reduced availability of type V collagen appeared to be the major disease-causing mechanism, besides other intra- and extracellular contributing factors. All type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102 patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. No COL5A1/COL5A2 mutation was detected in 24 patients who displayed skin and joint hyperextensibility but lacked dystrophic scarring.

Alterations in TR [thyroid hormone (TH) receptor]1 isoform expression have been reported in models of both physiologic and pathologic cardiac hypertrophy as well as in patients with heart failure. In this report, we demonstrate that TH induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and, moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38. Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disease of unknown cause that mainly affects Japanese children. The incidence of familial occurrence accounts for 9% of cases. The characteristic lesions of moyamoya disease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2. METHODS: To determine whether a gene related to moyamoya disease is located on chromosome 17, we conducted microsatellite linkage analyses on 24 families containing 56 patients with moyamoya disease. Leukocyte DNA extracted from the family members was subjected to polymerase chain reaction for a total of 22 microsatellite markers on chromosome 17. The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragments were analyzed with GeneScan on an automated sequencer. RESULTS: Two-point linkage analysis gave a maximum log(10) odds (LOD) score of 3.11 at the recombination fraction of 0.00 for the marker at locus D17S939. The affected pedigree member method also showed a significantly low P value (<1. 0x10(-5)) for the 5 adjacent markers at 17q25. Multipoint linkage analysis also indicated that the disease gene is contained within the 9-cM region of D17S785 to D17S836, with a maximum LOD score of 4. 58.

OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively ascertain the extent and severity of clinical features in affected individuals from 2 large families with proven heterozygous mutations in the CYLD locus and to correlate these findings with the 3 appendageal tumor predisposition syndromes (familial cylindromatosis, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, and multiple familial trichoepitheliomas) known to be associated with such germline mutations. DESIGN: Interfamilial and intrafamilial observational study. SETTING: Tertiary genetic and dermatology referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four individuals recruited from 2 large multigenerational families with CYLD mutations. Clinical details, history, and tumor maps were obtained from all participants; in 18, the information was corroborated by detailed clinical examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor density, distribution and histologic findings, associated medical conditions, patient symptoms, and impact of disease on quality of life. RESULTS: The severity of penetrance and phenotype varied within families. Although an approximately equal female to male predisposition was noted, 5 women and 1 man (of 26 patients surveyed [23%]) had undergone total scalp removal. The average age at onset was 16 years (range, 8-30 years). Symptoms reported by affected patients included painful tumors (in 12 of 23 patients [52%] who answered the question), conductive deafness, and sexual dysfunction. Of the 26 surveyed patients, tumors were noted on the scalp in 21 (81%), on the trunk in 18 (69%), and in the pubic area in 11 (42%). Tumor mapping provided clinical evidence that correlated with hormonally stimulated hair follicles being particularly vulnerable to loss of heterozygosity and tumor induction. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease at sites other than the head and neck appears to be underreported in the literature and greatly affects quality of life. Differentiation between the clinical diagnoses has little prognostic or clinical utility in genetic counseling, even within individuals from the same family. Thus, we suggest an encompassing diagnosis of \"CYLD cutaneous syndrome.\" Finally, the clinical distribution of tumors suggests that hormonal factors may play an important role in tumor induction in these patients."

Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder. METHODS: Clinical studies were conducted and linkage and haplotype analyses were performed for the three families. A total of 16 individuals, including the 6 with MSS and 10 unaffected relatives, were genotyped for six polymorphic microsatellite markers from the CCFDN region on 18qter. RESULTS: Linkage analysis of markers in the 18qter region, where we previously had located the CCFDN gene, produced a lod score of 3.55, demonstrating colocalization of the gene responsible for MSS with demyelinating neuropathy and myoglobinuria with the CCFDN gene. Moreover, the patients with MSS shared the conserved marker haplotype found in CCFDN chromosomes.

Transcription of eukaryotic genes by RNA polymerase II (pol II) is a complex, highly regulated multiphasic process. Pol II pauses in the proximity of the promoter on a large fraction of transcribed genes. Transcription initiation and elongation of transcripts are under distinct control. Induced gene expression can thus be due to enhanced initiation and/or stimulated elongation. Pausing and resumption of the elongation of transcripts is under the control of transcription elongation factors. Three of them, P-TEFb, DSIF, and NELF have been well characterized as protein complexes with multiple general but also gene specific functions. Elongation factors execute checkpoint functions but serve also as targets for signaling processes which regulate gene expression. Due to the general importance of transcription elongation factors, it is difficult to delineate the mechanisms by which elongation of specific genes is regulated by specific intracellular signals. However, it is clear that the controlled pausing of pol II provides an opportunity to finely control timing and quantity of transcriptional output."

METHODS: Using data from a safety study of 948 abacavir users with 22 hypersensitivity events identified from claims and validated through medical record review, we used a recursive partitioning analysis to construct an algorithm to differentiate between patients with and without validated adverse events. Bootstrap resampling techniques provided validation for the analysis. RESULTS: The analysis produced a classification tree with three decision nodes that comprised the best indicators of HSRs. The predictors included any one of several specific symptoms commonly found with this reaction, a claims diagnosis of adverse effect of drug, anaphylactic shock or unspecified allergy, and a discontinuation in abacavir prior to completing a 90-day course of therapy. The algorithm demonstrated 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity when tested using a bootstrap resampling approach with the current data. CONCLUSIONS: A sensitive and specific algorithm for identifying abacavir hypersensitivity from claims was created. This algorithm would permit efficient identification of charts for medical review. Further testing of the algorithm with additional medical claims data for abacavir users will be required to ascertain its validity across databases."

The topic of this review is how Tibetans have adapted genetically to high altitude, particularly with reference to altitude-induced changes in metabolism. What advances does it highlight? It highlights recent work on metabolic phenotyping in Tibetans and demonstrates that selected genetic haplotypes influence their metabolism of fats and glucose. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude. Consistent with the phenotype, EGLN1 in Tibetans has a gain-of-function mutation that confers a higher affinity for oxygen, hence less sensitivity to hypoxia. Considering the demands imposed upon metabolism in meeting energy demands despite limitations on fuel oxidation, we hypothesized that other selected genes might alter metabolism to allow adaptation to altitude despite the desensitization of the upstream hypoxia sensing caused by the EGLN1 mutation that results in the failure to sense hypoxia. A shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would provide adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Measurements of serum metabolites from Tibetans living at high altitude are consistent with this hypothesis; the EPAS1 haplotype is significantly associated with increased lactate levels (suggesting increased anaerobic metabolism), and the PPARA haplotype and serum free fatty acids are positively related (suggesting decreased fat oxidation). These data suggest that the high-altitude adaptations may offer protection from diabetes at high altitude but increase the risk of diabetes at lower elevations and/or with adoption of a non-traditional diet. It should also be considered in future work in the field that because iron is a cofactor for EGLN1, there may be significant associations of phenotypes with the significant degrees of variation seen in tissue iron among human populations."

Dietary therapy often fails, whereas bariatric surgery, although successful, is demanding and applicable to a limited number of patients. Drug therapy has had many setbacks over the past 20 years because of serious adverse effects; however, several new drugs for the treatment of obesity are either licensed in some parts of the world, submitted for registration, or completing phase III trials. These include combinations (at low dose) of existing drugs, e.g., bupropion + naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine + topiramate (Qsymia), higher doses of existing drugs licensed for other indications (liraglutide, 3 mg), and new entities (lorcaserin). We discuss the challenges and opportunities for obesity pharmacotherapy and review in detail the efficacy of the new drugs regarding weight loss and both desirable and potential undesirable cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic risk factors. Substantial barriers remain, even if the drugs are approved, in successfully integrating these agents into weight management practice, largely related to cost, patient acceptability, and clinician willingness to be engaged in obesity treatment. Although hard clinical outcome benefit (at least for CV outcomes) has yet to be established, obesity pharmacotherapy may soon address many of the challenges in the clinical management of obesity, although newer and better drug combinations and more evidence of benefit from appropriately designed outcome trials is needed."

Predicting prognosis is the key factor in selecting the proper treatment modality for patients with spinal metastases. Therefore, various assessment systems have been designed in order to provide a basis for deciding the course of treatment. Such systems have been proposed by Tokuhashi, Sioutos, Tomita, Van der Linden, and Bauer. The scores differ greatly in the kind of parameters assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of each score. Eight parameters were assessed for 69 patients (37 male, 32 female): location, general condition, number of extraspinal bone metastases, number of spinal metastases, visceral metastases, primary tumour, severity of spinal cord palsy, and pathological fracture. Scores according to Tokuhashi (original and revised), Sioutos, Tomita, Van der Linden, and Bauer were assessed as well as a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture. Nineteen patients were still alive as of September 2006 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. All other patients died after a mean period of 17 months after operation. The mean overall survival period was only 3 months for lung cancer, followed by prostate (7 months), kidney (23 months), breast (35 months), and multiple myeloma (51 months). At univariate survival analysis, primary tumour and visceral metastases were significant parameters, while Karnofsky score was only significant in the group including myeloma patients. In multivariate analysis of all seven parameters assessed, primary tumour and visceral metastases were the only significant parameters. Of all seven scoring systems, the original Bauer score and a Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture had the best association with survival (P < 0.001). The data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastases. However, decision for or against surgery should never be based alone on a prognostic score but should take symptoms like pain or neurological compromise into account."

Whole-genome microarray analysis comparing sediment-grown G. uraniireducens with cells grown in defined culture medium indicated that there were 1084 genes that had higher transcript levels during growth in sediments. Thirty-four c-type cytochrome genes were upregulated in the sediment-grown cells, including several genes that are homologous to cytochromes that are required for optimal Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction by G. sulfurreducens. Sediment-grown cells also had higher levels of transcripts, indicative of such physiological states as nitrogen limitation, phosphate limitation and heavy metal stress. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that many of the metabolic indicator genes that appeared to be upregulated in sediment-grown G. uraniireducens also showed an increase in expression in the natural community of Geobacter species present during an in situ uranium bioremediation field experiment at the Rifle site. These results demonstrate that it is feasible to monitor gene expression of a microorganism growing in sediments on a genome scale and that analysis of the physiological status of a pure culture growing in subsurface sediments can provide insights into the factors controlling the physiology of natural subsurface communities."

We have characterized the mismatch repair system (MMR) of the highly radiation-resistant type strain of Deinococcus radiodurans, ATCC 13939. We show that the MMR system is functional in this organism, where it participates in ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and recombination. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition. Inactivation of MutS1 or MutL resulted in a seven-fold increase in the frequency of spontaneous RifR mutagenesis and a ten-fold increase in the efficiency of integration of a donor point-mutation marker during bacterial transformation. Inactivation of the mismatch repair-associated UvrD helicase increased the level of spontaneous mutagenesis, but had no effect on marker integration--suggesting that binding of MutS1 and MutL proteins to a mismatched heteroduplex suffices to inhibit recombination between non identical (homeologous) DNAs. In contrast, inactivation of MutS2, encoded by the second mutS -related gene present in D. radiodurans, had no effect on mutagenesis or recombination. Cells devoid of MutS1 or MutL proteins were as resistant to gamma-rays, mitomycin C and UV-irradiation as wild-type bacteria, suggesting that the mismatch repair system is not essential for the reconstitution of a functional genome after DNA damage."

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a highly adaptable human pathogen and there is a constant search for effective antibiotics. Fosfomycin is a potent irreversible inhibitor of MurA, an enolpyruvyl transferase that uses phosphoenolpyruvate as substrate. The goal of this study was to identify the pathways and processes primarily affected by fosfomycin at the genome-wide transcriptome level to aid development of new drugs. RESULTS: S. aureus ATCC 29213 cells were treated with sub-MIC concentrations of fosfomycin and harvested at 10, 20 and 40 minutes after treatment. S. aureus GeneChip statistical data analysis was complemented by gene set enrichment analysis. A visualization tool for mapping gene expression data into biological pathways was developed in order to identify the metabolic processes affected by fosfomycin. We have shown that the number of significantly differentially expressed genes in treated cultures increased with time and with increasing fosfomycin concentration. The target pathway - peptidoglycan biosynthesis - was upregulated following fosfomycin treatment. Modulation of transport processes, cofactor biosynthesis, energy metabolism and nucleic acid biosynthesis was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathways and genes downregulated by fosfomycin have been identified, in contrast to previously described cell wall active antibiotics, and was explained by starvation response induced by phosphoenolpyruvate accumulation. Transcriptomic profiling, in combination with meta-analysis, has been shown to be a valuable tool in determining bacterial response to a specific antibiotic."

BACKGROUND: Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest shown by normal cells, and has been most extensively studied in replicative senescence caused by telomere shortening. Several conditions, including oncogenic Ras over-expression and inappropriate culture conditions, also induce senescence without telomere shortening. However, it remains unclear how a common set of senescence phenotypes is indistinguishably induced in various types of senescence. RESULTS: We demonstrate that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays important causative roles in senescent cells following telomere shortening, Ras-Raf activation, oxidative stress or inappropriate culture conditions. By monitoring the kinetics of p38 activation, we suggest that p38 is activated not directly by the initial stimuli, but in response to unidentified cellular conditions caused by these stimuli. Importantly, this p38-activating condition appears to be defined quantitatively as a sum of continuous and low-level stresses, and remains even after the initial stimuli are withdrawn, which may explain the well-known irreversible nature of cellular senescence. We also show that papilloma virus E7 abolishes the p38-induced growth arrest but not other senescence-associated phenotypes, indicating the differential role of pRb in the downstream of p38. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that p38 comprises the senescence-executing pathway in response to diverse stimuli."

We report on a 46-year-old Hispanic woman who was previously diagnosed with moyamoya disease on magnetic resonance imaging after a presentation with stroke-like symptoms. Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5). A preceding screening transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with an aortic diameter of 3.2 cm; at the time of moyamoya diagnosis, the aorta was 3.5 cm with mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. Four years later, the patient had had an acute aortic dissection, Stanford type A, which was repaired successfully. This case report is the third individual with TS associated with moyamoya disease and the first associated with dissection. The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV). Although this may be a chance occurrence, we hypothesize that moyamoya disease could be a manifestation of the vasculopathy in TS."

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) has been challenging over decades, mostly due to a number of difficulties associated with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), which have been the most effective stroke prevention treatment for a long time. The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) and oral direct inhibitors of factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban) have emerged recently as an alternative to VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. These drugs act rapidly, and have a predictable and stable dose-related anticoagulant effect with a few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The novel oral anticoagulants are used in fixed doses with no need for regular laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation intensity. However, each of these drugs has distinct pharmacological properties that could influence optimal use in clinical practice. The following phase 3 randomized trials with novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for stroke prevention in AF have been completed: the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial with dabigatran, the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial with rivaroxaban, and the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolism Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial with apixaban. Moreover, the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to prevent Strokes (AVERROES) trial included patients with AF who have failed or were unsuitable for warfarin, and compared apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Overall, apixaban has two large trials for stroke prevention in AF showing benefits not only over warfarin, but also over aspirin among those patients who have failed or refused warfarin. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin in the reduction of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality, with a similar reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke and better tolerability. When compared with aspirin in the AVERROES trial, apixaban was associated with more effective reduction of stroke, a similar risk of major bleeding, and better tolerability. In this review article, the authors summarize the current knowledge on novel oral anticoagulants and discuss the clinical aspects of their use for stroke prevention in AF, with particular emphasis on apixaban."

To investigate whether the rs2910164 G/C polymorphism was associated with asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), we performed an association study in a pediatric Mexican cohort. We included 979 pediatric patients (asthma: 402, SLE: 367 and JRA: 210) and 531 control subjects without inflammatory or immune diseases. Genotyping was performed using the 5' exonuclease technique. The genotype distribution of the rs2910164 polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each group. No significant differences were detected in the distribution of this polymorphism between cases and controls (P = 0.108, 0.609 and 0.553 for subjects with asthma, JRA and SLE, respectively). However, stratification by gender showed a statistically significant difference between asthmatic and control females, where the C allele was significantly associated with protection to asthma (odds ratio = 0.694, 95% confidence interval 0.519-0.929, P = 0.0138). Our results provide evidence that rs2910164 may play a role in the susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma, but not SLE or JRA in Mexicans. Further association studies may contribute to determining the role of miR-146a single-nucleotide polymorphisms in immune-mediated diseases."

BACKGROUND: EEM syndrome is the rare association of ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy. METHODS: We here demonstrate through molecular analysis that EEM is caused by distinct homozygous CDH3 mutations in two previously published families. RESULTS: In family 1, a missense mutation (c.965A-->T) causes a change of amino acid 322 from asparagine to isoleucine; this amino acid is located in a highly conserved motif likely to affect Ca2+ binding affecting specificity of the cell-cell binding function. In family 2, a homozygous frameshift deletion (c.829delG) introduces a truncated fusion protein with a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 295, expected to cause a non-functional protein lacking both its intracellular and membrane spanning domains and its extracellular cadherin repeats 3-5. Our mouse in situ expression data demonstrate that Cdh3 is expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge from E10.5 to E12.5, and later in the interdigital mesenchyme, a pattern compatible with the EEM phenotype. Furthermore, we discuss possible explanations for the phenotypic differences between EEM and congenital hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD), which is also caused by CDH3 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have ascertained a third gene associated with ectrodactyly and have demonstrated a hitherto unrecognised role of CDH3 in shaping the human hand."

Mechanism-based inhibitors of enzymes, which mimic reactive intermediates in the reaction pathway, have been deployed extensively in the analysis of metabolic pathways and as candidate drugs. The inhibition of cytosine-[C5]-specific DNA methyltransferases (C5 MTases) by oligodeoxynucleotides containing 5-azadeoxycytidine (AzadC) and 5-fluorodeoxycytidine (FdC) provides a well-documented example of mechanism-based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism. Here, we describe the interaction between the C5 MTase from Haemophilus haemolyticus (M.HhaI) and an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing 2-H pyrimidinone, an analogue often referred to as zebularine and known to give rise to high-affinity complexes with MTases. X-ray crystallography has demonstrated the formation of a covalent bond between M.HhaI and the 2-H pyrimidinone-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. This observation enables a comparison between the mechanisms of action of 2-H pyrimidinone with other mechanism-based inhibitors such as FdC. This novel complex provides a molecular explanation for the mechanism of action of the anti-cancer drug zebularine."

The soluble hydrolases of the mammalian lysosome are marked for delivery to this organelle by the addition of mannose 6-phosphate to their N-glycans. Two related mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) recognize this feature in the trans Golgi network (TGN) and deliver the hydrolases to the late endosome. In contrast, the vacuolar hydrolases of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae do not contain 6-phosphate monoesters on their N-glycans, and the only sorting receptor so far identified in this organism is the product of the VPS10 gene. This protein also cycles between the Golgi and the late endosome, but is unrelated to the vertebrate MPRs, and recognizes a specific amino acid sequence of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). This has led to the notion that although yeast and mammals share many components in Golgi to endosome traffic, they use unrelated receptor systems to sort their abundant soluble hydrolases. In this paper, we report that the yeast genome does in fact contain an uncharacterized ORF (YPR079w) that encodes a membrane protein that is distantly related to mammalian MPRs. The protein encoded by this gene (which we term MRL1) cycles through the late endosome. Moreover, there is a strong synergistic effect on the maturation of proteinases A and B when both MRL1 and VPS10 are deleted, which suggests that Mrl1p may serve as a sorting receptor in the delivery of vacuolar hydrolases."

Here we reveal that Sef, a known tumor suppressor and inhibitor of growth factor signaling, is\u00a0a spatial regulator of NF-\u03baB. Sef expression is regulated by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, and Sef specifically inhibits \"classical\" NF-\u03baB (p50:p65) activation by these ligands. Like I\u03baBs, Sef sequesters NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm of resting cells. However, contrary to I\u03baBs, Sef continues to constrain NF-\u03baB nuclear entry upon ligand stimulation. Accordingly, endogenous Sef knockdown markedly enhances stimulus-induced NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and consequent activity. This study establishes Sef as a feedback antagonist of proinflammatory cytokines and highlights its potential to regulate the crosstalk between proinflammatory cytokine receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases."

Such systems have been proposed by Tokuhashi, Sioutos, Tomita, Van der Linden, and Bauer. The scores differ greatly in the kind of parameters assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of each score. Eight parameters were assessed for 69 patients (37 male, 32 female): location, general condition, number of extraspinal bone metastases, number of spinal metastases, visceral metastases, primary tumour, severity of spinal cord palsy, and pathological fracture. Scores according to Tokuhashi (original and revised), Sioutos, Tomita, Van der Linden, and Bauer were assessed as well as a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture. Nineteen patients were still alive as of September 2006 with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. All other patients died after a mean period of 17 months after operation. The mean overall survival period was only 3 months for lung cancer, followed by prostate (7 months), kidney (23 months), breast (35 months), and multiple myeloma (51 months). At univariate survival analysis, primary tumour and visceral metastases were significant parameters, while Karnofsky score was only significant in the group including myeloma patients. In multivariate analysis of all seven parameters assessed, primary tumour and visceral metastases were the only significant parameters. Of all seven scoring systems, the original Bauer score and a Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture had the best association with survival (P < 0.001). The data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastases. However, decision for or against surgery should never be based alone on a prognostic score but should take symptoms like pain or neurological compromise into account."

The blockade by dupilumab of these key drivers of type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-mediated inflammation could help in the treatment of related diseases, including atopic dermatitis. METHODS: We performed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adults who had moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis despite treatment with topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Dupilumab was evaluated as monotherapy in two 4-week trials and in one 12-week trial and in combination with topical glucocorticoids in another 4-week study. End points included the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, the investigator's global assessment score, pruritus, safety assessments, serum biomarker levels, and disease transcriptome. RESULTS: In the 4-week monotherapy studies, dupilumab resulted in rapid and dose-dependent improvements in clinical indexes, biomarker levels, and the transcriptome. The results of the 12-week study of dupilumab monotherapy reproduced and extended the 4-week findings: 85% of patients in the dupilumab group, as compared with 35% of those in the placebo group, had a 50% reduction in the EASI score (EASI-50, with higher scores in the EASI indicating greater severity of eczema) (P<0.001); 40% of patients in the dupilumab group, as compared with 7% in the placebo group, had a score of 0 to 1 (indicating clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions) on the investigator's global assessment (P<0.001); and pruritus scores decreased (indicating a reduction in itch) by 55.7% in the dupilumab group versus 15.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001). In the combination study, 100% of the patients in the dupilumab group, as compared with 50% of those who received topical glucocorticoids with placebo injection, met the criterion for EASI-50 (P=0.002), despite the fact that patients who received dupilumab plus glucocorticoids used less than half the amount of topical glucocorticoids used by those who received placebo plus the topical medication (P=0.16). Adverse events, such as skin infection, occurred more frequently with placebo; nasopharyngitis and headache were the most frequent adverse events with dupilumab. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with dupilumab had marked and rapid improvement in all the evaluated measures of atopic dermatitis disease activity. Side-effect profiles were not dose-limiting.

In this report, we describe a family with EEM syndrome caused by a novel CDH3 gene mutation and review the mutation spectrum and limb abnormalities in both EEM and HJMD. A protein structure model showing the localization of different mutations causing both syndromes is presented. The CDH3 gene was sequenced and investigation of the mutations performed using a protein structure model. The conservation score was calculated by ConSurf. We identified a novel CDH3 gene mutation, p.G277V, which resides in a conserved residue located on a \u03b2-strand in the second cadherin domain. Review of the data on previously published mutations showed intra-familial and inter-familial variations in the severity of the limb abnormalities. Syndactyly was the most consistent clinical finding present in all the patients regardless of mutation type. The results of our study point to a phenotypic continuum between HJMD and EEM. It is important for genetic counseling to keep in mind the possible clinical/phenotypic overlap between these 2 syndromes and to be aware of the possible risk of limb abnormalities in future pregnancies in families with HJMD syndrome. CDH3 gene mutation screening is recommended in patients with both these syndromes as part of the work-up in order to offer appropriate genetic counseling."

These proteins are very hydrophobic, which complicates their identification by \"classical\" proteomic protocols using trypsin digestion. Due to the lack of trypsin cleavage sites, the achievable protein coverage is limited or even insufficient for reliable protein identification. To identify such proteins and to enhance their coverage, we introduced a modified method comprising standard three-step procedure (SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis). In this method, chymotrypsin, single or in combination with trypsin, was used, which enabled to obtain proteolytic peptides from the hydrophobic regions and to identify new oil bodies' proteins. Our method can be easily applied to identification of other hydrophobic proteins."

OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, an oral direct factor Xa-inhibitor was non-inferior to adjusted dose warfarin in the prevention of stroke and embolism among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ROCKET-AF trial and has been approved for stroke prevention in AF. CASE REPORT: A 88-years-old female (body-mass-index = 19.95) with AF, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, hospitalized because of heart failure and a non-convulsive epileptic state, was treated by valproate, mirtazepin, nebivolol, digitoxin, lisinopril, gliclazide and amlodipine. Irrespective of renal insufficiency, rivaroxaban 15 mg/d was started. After 3 days rivaroxaban was stopped because of concerns about the bleeding risk. Coagulation tests 28 h after rivaroxaban-intake showed INR 2.26, PT 35%, aPTT 38.3 s and anti-Factor Xa-activity 2.00 U/ml. Explanations for the prolonged anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban comprise renal failure, the low body-mass-index, the advanced age and drug-drug interactions of rivaroxaban with mirtazepin, valproate and amlodipine. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should consider renal function, concomitant medication, polymorbidity and age prior to prescribing rivaroxaban. Care has to be taken when prescribing rivaroxaban to patients who are different from those included in the ROCKET AF trial."

OBJECTIVE: Ganglioside-induced differentiation associated-protein 1 (GDAP1) mutations are commonly associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) neuropathy; however, in rare instances, they also lead to autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ADCMT). We aimed to investigate the frequency of disease-causing heterozygous GDAP1 mutations in ADCMT and their associated phenotype. METHODS: We performed mutation analysis in a large cohort of ADCMT patients by means of bidirectional sequencing of coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of GDAP1. Intragenic GDAP1 deletions were excluded using an allele quantification assay. We confirmed the pathogenic character of one sequence variant by in vitro experiments assaying mitochondrial morphology and function. RESULTS: In 8 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) families we identified 4 pathogenic heterozygous GDAP1 mutations, 3 of which are novel. Three of the mutations displayed reduced disease penetrance. Disease onset in the affected individuals was variable, ranging from early childhood to adulthood. Disease progression was slow in most patients and overall severity milder than typically seen in autosomal recessive GDAP1 mutations. Electrophysiologic changes are heterogeneous but compatible with axonal neuropathy in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: With this study, we broaden the phenotypic and genetic spectrum of autosomal dominant GDAP1-associated neuropathies. We show that patients with dominant GDAP1 mutations may display clear axonal CMT, but may also have only minimal clinical and electrophysiologic abnormalities. We demonstrate that cell-based functional assays can be reliably used to test the pathogenicity of unknown variants. We discuss the implications of phenotypic variability and the reduced penetrance of autosomal dominant GDAP1 mutations for CMT diagnostic testing and counseling."

This interaction occurs through a series of eight BRC repeat sequences in BRCA2. A mammalian two-hybrid assay using individual BRC repeats demonstrated that BRC6 did not bind to RAD51, whereas there was strong (BRC1, 2 and 4), intermediate (BRC8), or weak (BRC3, 5 and 7) binding of other BRC repeats to RAD51. In serial deletion mutation experiments, binding strengths were increased when the C-terminal BRC repeat was removed from BRC1-8, BRC1-5 and BRC1-3.

Our results suggest that patch testing has a weak sensitivity in SJS/TEN and is not appropriate in these diseases. Patch testing seems more adapted to other cutaneous ADRs, such as AGEP, in which the proportion of positive patch tests was significantly higher (p < 0.02). Nevertheless, the difference of sensitivity of patch testing in SJS/ TEN, AGEP or other cutaneous ADRs could be linked not only to the clinical type of eruption, but also to the different spectrum of culprit drugs in each type of eruption."

In order to analyze the transcriptional regulation of the muscle-specific subunit of the human phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M) gene, chimeric genes composed of the upstream region of the PGAM-M gene and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were constructed and transfected into C2C12 skeletal myocytes, primary cultured cardiac muscle cells, and C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. The expression of chimeric reporter genes was restricted in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. In C2C12 myotubes and primary cultured cardiac muscle cells, the segment between nucleotides -165 and +41 relative to the transcription initiation site was sufficient to confer maximal CAT activity. This region contains two E boxes and one MEF-2 motif. Deletion and substitution mutation analysis showed that a single MEF-2 motif but not the E boxes had a substantial effect on skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific enhancer activity and that the cardiac muscle-specific negative regulatory region was located between nucleotides -505 and -165. When the PGAM-M gene constructs were cotransfected with MyoD into C3H10T1/2, the profile of CAT activity was similar to that observed in C2C12 myotubes. Gel mobility shift analysis revealed that when the nuclear extracts from skeletal and cardiac muscle cells were used, the PGAM-M MEF-2 site generated the specific band that was inhibited by unlabeled PGAM-M MEF-2 and muscle creatine kinase MEF-2 oligomers but not by a mutant PGAM-M MEF-2 oligomer. These observations define the PGAM-M enhancer as the only cardiac- and skeletal-muscle-specific enhancer characterized thus far that is mainly activated through MEF-2."

Previous field studies on in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater in an aquifer in Rifle, Colorado identified two distinct phases following the addition of acetate to stimulate microbial respiration. In phase I, Geobacter species are the predominant organisms, Fe(III) is reduced, and microbial reduction of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) removes uranium from the groundwater. In phase II, Fe(III) is depleted, sulfate is reduced, and sulfate-reducing bacteria predominate. Long-term monitoring revealed an unexpected third phase during which U(VI) removal continues even after acetate additions are stopped. All three of these phases were successfully reproduced in flow-through sediment columns. When sediments from the third phase were heat sterilized, the capacity for U(VI) removal was lost. In the live sediments U(VI) removed from the groundwater was recovered as U(VI) in the sediments. This contrasts to the recovery of U(IV) in sediments resulting from the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) during the Fe(III) reduction phase in acetate-amended sediments. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in the sediments in which U(VI) was being adsorbed indicated that members of the Firmicutes were the predominant organisms whereas no Firmicutes sequences were detected in background sediments which did not have the capacity to sorb U(VI), suggesting that the U(VI) adsorption might be due to the presence of these living organisms or at least their intact cell components. This unexpected enhanced adsorption of U(VI) onto sediments following the stimulation of microbial growth in the subsurface may potentially enhance the cost effectiveness of in situ uranium bioremediation."

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA (miRNA) is an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs that act as gene regulators. Recent studies have suggested that miRNA deregulation is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancer. However, information about cancer-related miRNA is mostly limited to tissue miRNA. The aim of this study was to find specific profiles of serum-derived miRNAs of ovarian cancer based on a comparative study using a miRNA microarray of serum, tissue, and ascites. METHODS: From 2 ovarian cancer patients and a healthy control, total RNA was isolated from their serum, tissue, and ascites, respectively, and analyzed by a microarray. Under the comparative study of each miRNA microarray, we sorted out several miRNAs showing a consistent regulation tendency throughout all 3 specimens and the greatest range of alteration in serum as potential biomarkers. The availability of biomarkers was confirmed by qRT-PCR of 18 patients and 12 controls. RESULTS: Out of 2222 kinds of total miRNAs that were identified in the microarray analysis, 95 miRNAs were down-regulated and 88 miRNAs were up-regulated, in the serum, tissue, and ascites of cancer patients. Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls. Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145) out of 5 selected miRNAs were significantly underexpressed in the serum of ovarian cancer patients in qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer. Also, serum miRNAs is a promising and useful tool for discriminating between controls and patients with serous ovarian cancer."

Most human genes are loaded with promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules that are poised for release into productive elongation by P-TEFb. We present evidence that Gdown1, the product of the POLR2M gene that renders Pol II responsive to Mediator, is involved in Pol II elongation control. During in vitro transcription, Gdown1 specifically blocked elongation stimulation by TFIIF, inhibited the termination activity of TTF2, and influenced pausing factors NELF and DSIF, but did not affect the function of TFIIS or the mRNA capping enzyme. Without P-TEFb, Gdown1 led to the production of stably paused polymerases in the presence of nuclear extract. Supporting these mechanistic insights, ChIP-Seq demonstrated that Gdown1 mapped over essentially all poised polymerases across the human genome. Our results establish that Gdown1 stabilizes poised polymerases while maintaining their responsiveness to P-TEFb and suggest that Mediator overcomes a Gdown1-mediated block of initiation by allowing TFIIF function."

Triple-negative breast cancer is difficult to treat because of the lack of rationale-based therapies. There are no established markers and targets that can be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed, it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glioblastoma, the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current care standards for newly diagnosed glioblastoma consist, when feasible, in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, as described in the Stupp protocol. Despite optimal treatment, nearly all malignant gliomas recur. If the tumor is symptomatic for mass effect, repeated surgery may be proposed. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the survival of patients with histologically confirmed primary glioblastoma (WHO grade 4) who were operated in two centers between January 2004 and December 2007. All patients who underwent a second resection for recurrent glioblastoma were included. RESULTS: During this period, 320 patients were operated in the two centers, with 240 surgical resections and 80 surgical biopsies. In the surgical resection group, 8.3% (20 patients) underwent a second surgical resection for glioblastoma. The mean age was 52 years. At the end of the study, seven patients were alive. The median survival was 24 months and progression-free survival was 7.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of resection of recurrent glioblastoma on survival has not been extensively studied. No randomized trials have been conducted. Our data were globally identical to other retrospective studies. Selected patients with recurrent glioblastoma may be candidates for repeated surgery when the situation appears favorable based on assessment of the individual patient's factors. Factors such medical history, neurological status, location of the tumor, and progression-free survival have been proven in retrospective studies to give better results."

Herein, we have studied 29 case subjects of common and rare de novo ROBs to determine their parental origins and timing of formation. We compared these case subjects to 35 published case subjects of common ROBs and found that most common ROBs apparently have the same breakpoints and arise mainly during oogenesis (50/54). These probably form through a common mechanism and have been termed \"class 1.\" Collectively, rare ROBs also occur mostly during oogenesis (7/10) but probably arise through a more \"random\" mechanism or a variety of mechanisms and have been termed \"class 2.\" Thus, we demonstrate that although both classes of ROBs occur predominantly during meiosis, the common, class 1 ROBs occur primarily during oogenesis and likely form through a mechanism distinct from that forming class 2 ROBs."

This intravenous drug is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, on the basis of its clinical benefit in this setting in the phase I KEYNOTE 001 trial (expansion cohorts) and the phase II and III trials, KEYNOTE 002 and 006.

In the trials with active comparator arms, pembrolizumab regimens significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rates (ORR) relative to ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve patients (KEYNOTE 006), and significantly improved PFS and ORR, but not OS (although OS data are immature), relative to chemotherapy in ipilimumab-refractory patients, who had also received BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy if BRAF-mutation positive (KEYNOTE 002). Pembrolizumab has an acceptable tolerability profile, with immune-related adverse events that are generally manageable/reversible.

          "context": "Opening up the blackbox: an interpretable deep neural network-based classifier for cell-type specific enhancer predictions. BACKGROUND: Gene expression is mediated by specialized cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), the most prominent of which are called enhancers. Early experiments indicated that enhancers located far from the gene promoters are often responsible for mediating gene transcription. Knowing their properties, regulatory activity, and genomic targets is crucial to the functional understanding of cellular events, ranging from cellular homeostasis to differentiation. Recent genome-wide investigation of epigenomic marks has indicated that enhancer elements could be enriched for certain epigenomic marks, such as, combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. METHODS: Our efforts in this paper are motivated by these recent advances in epigenomic profiling methods, which have uncovered enhancer-associated chromatin features in different cell types and organisms. Specifically, in this paper, we use recent state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods and develop a deep neural network (DNN)-based architecture, called EP-DNN, to predict the presence and types of enhancers in the human genome. It uses as features, the expression levels of the histone modifications at the peaks of the functional sites as well as in its adjacent regions. We apply EP-DNN to four different cell types: H1, IMR90, HepG2, and HeLa S3. We train EP-DNN using p300 binding sites as enhancers, and TSS and random non-DHS sites as non-enhancers. We perform EP-DNN predictions to quantify the validation rate for different levels of confidence in the predictions and also perform comparisons against two state-of-the-art computational models for enhancer predictions, DEEP-ENCODE and RFECS. RESULTS: We find that EP-DNN has superior accuracy and takes less time to make predictions. Next, we develop methods to make EP-DNN interpretable by computing the importance of each input feature in the classification task. This analysis indicates that the important histone modifications were distinct for different cell types, with some overlaps, e.g., H3K27ac was important in cell type H1 but less so in HeLa S3, while H3K4me1 was relatively important in all four cell types. We finally use the feature importance analysis to reduce the number of input features needed to train the DNN, thus reducing training time, which is often the computational bottleneck in the use of a DNN. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we developed EP-DNN, which has high accuracy of prediction, with validation rates above 90\u00a0% for the operational region of enhancer prediction for all four cell lines that we studied, outperforming DEEP-ENCODE and RFECS. Then, we developed a method to analyze a trained DNN and determine which histone modifications are important, and within that, which features proximal or distal to the enhancer site, are important."

Median overall survival (OS) for newly diagnosed patients is only about 12 to 18 months. GBM tumors invariably recur, and there is no widely recognized and effective standard treatment for recurrent GBM. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months). Response duration was highly correlated with OS (r(2) = .92, P<.0001), and median OS for responders was 24.8 months. Seven of 16 responders exhibited initial tumor growth on magnetic resonance imaging. Compliance appeared to be linked with both improved response and survival. The tumor growth model predicted tumor arrest and shrinkage only after several weeks of continuous NovoTTF Therapy, consistent with the observed clinical findings of initial transient tumor growth in some patients. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients. Some responders exhibit initial tumor growth before shrinkage, indicating treatment should not be terminated prior to allowing for the full effect of NovoTTF Therapy to be realized. OS is longer in responders than in nonresponders. High daily compliance rates may be associated with increased likelihood of an objective response and are predictive of improved survival."

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The decision for operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases is dependent on the patient's predicted survival. Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution. PATIENT SAMPLE: The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patients. The potential prognostic factors that are known to influence survival such as general condition, extraspinal bone metastases, vertebral bone metastases, visceral metastases, and neurologic assessment based on Frankel score were also studied. METHODS: The predicted survival according to the four scoring systems were calculated and labeled as \"A\" scores. These patients were then rescored by assigning NPC as a good prognostic tumor and labeled as \"B\" scores. The predicted survival of scores A and B were compared with actual survival. Potential prognostic factors of survival were investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. For all scoring systems, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests were done; the predictive values were calculated using postestimation after Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The median overall survival for the whole cohort was 13 (range 1-120) months. In multivariate analysis, general condition (p<.01), visceral metastases (p<.01), and vertebral metastases (p<.01) showed significant association with survival. The absolute score of all scoring systems was significantly associated with actual survival, which extended to the different prognostic subgroups of each scoring systems. Log-rank test revealed significant differences in survival between the different prognostic subgroups of all scoring systems (p<.01). Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosis. All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so."

Since the main ultimate goal of farm animal raising is the production of proteins for human consumption, research tools to investigate proteins play a major role in farm animal and meat science. Indeed, proteomics has been applied to the field of farm animal science to monitor in vivo performances of livestock animals (growth performances, fertility, milk quality etc.), but also to further our understanding of the molecular processes at the basis of meat quality, which are largely dependent on the post mortem biochemistry of the muscle, often in a species-specific way. Post mortem alterations to the muscle proteome reflect the biological complexity of the process of \"muscle to meat conversion,\" a process that, despite decades of advancements, is all but fully understood. This is mainly due to the enormous amounts of variables affecting meat tenderness per se, including biological factors, such as animal species, breed specific-characteristic, muscle under investigation. However, it is rapidly emerging that the tender meat phenotype is not only tied to genetics (livestock breeding selection), but also to extrinsic factors, such as the rearing environment, feeding conditions, physical activity, administration of hormonal growth promotants, pre-slaughter handling and stress, post mortem handling. From this intricate scenario, biochemical approaches and systems-wide integrated investigations (metabolomics, transcriptomics, interactomics, phosphoproteomics, mathematical modeling), which have emerged as complementary tools to proteomics, have helped establishing a few milestones in our understanding of the events leading from muscle to meat conversion. The growing integration of omics disciplines in the field of systems biology will soon contribute to take further steps forward."

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) are severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) which are majorly caused by drugs. Though the incidence rate is low, SCAR sometimes can be life-threatening and leads to lifelong sequelae. Many pharmacogenomic associations in immune and nonimmune related genes with the development of SCAR have been discovered recently and the pharmacogenetic tests have been applied to prevent specific drug-induced SCAR. In this review, we discuss the recent advances of pharmacogenomics in SCAR."

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription and play pivotal roles in various biological processes such as development, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. Identifying cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes is a crucial step in understanding gene regulatory networks. To this end, we have used a comparative genomics approach to identify putative cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes in vertebrates. DESCRIPTION: We have created a database named TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes & Associated COnserved Noncoding ElementS) (http://tfcones.fugu-sg.org) which contains all human, mouse and fugu TF-encoding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) associated with them. The CNEs were identified by gene-by-gene alignments of orthologous TF-encoding gene loci using MLAGAN. We also predicted putative transcription factor binding sites within the CNEs. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs contain experimentally defined binding sites for transcriptional activators and repressors, indicating that a majority of the CNEs may function as transcriptional regulatory elements. The TF-encoding genes that are involved in nervous system development are generally enriched for human-fugu CNEs. Users can retrieve TF-encoding genes and their associated CNEs by conducting a keyword search or by selecting a family of DNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: The conserved noncoding elements identified in TFCONES represent a catalog of highly prioritized putative cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes and are candidates for functional assay."

Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS), first described in 1931, is an autosomal recessive condition characterised by somatic and mental retardation, congenital cataracts and cerebellar ataxia. Progressive myopathy was later reported to be also a cardinal sign of MSS, with myopathic changes on muscle biopsies. Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism and skeletal deformities related to pronounced hypotonia were also reported. The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter. Using homozygosity mapping strategy in two large consanguineous families of Turkish and Norwegian origin, respectively, we have identified the MSS locus on chromosome 5q31. LOD score calculation, including the consanguinity loops, gave a maximum value of 2.9 and 5.6 at theta=0 for the Turkish and the Norwegian families, respectively, indicating linkage between the disease and the D5S1995-D5S436 haplotype spanning a 9.3 cM interval. Patients of the two families presented with the strict clinical features of MSS. On the other hand, the study of two smaller French and Italian families, initially diagnosed as presenting an atypical MS syndrome, clearly excluded linkage from both the MSS locus on 5q31 and the CCFDN locus in 18qter. Patients of the two excluded families had all MSS features (but the myopathic changes) plus peripheral neuropathy and optic atrophy, and various combinations of microcornea, hearing impairment, seizures, Type I diabetes, cerebral atrophy and leucoencephalopathy, indicating that only the pure MSS syndrome is a homogeneous genetic entity."

Super-enhancers are clusters of transcriptional enhancers that drive cell-type-specific gene expression and are crucial to cell identity. Many disease-associated sequence variations are enriched in super-enhancer regions of disease-relevant cell types. Thus, super-enhancers can be used as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Current studies have identified super-enhancers in more than 100 cell types and demonstrated their functional importance. However, a centralized resource to integrate all these findings is not currently available. We developed dbSUPER (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/), the first integrated and interactive database of super-enhancers, with the primary goal of providing a resource for assistance in further studies related to transcriptional control of cell identity and disease. dbSUPER provides a responsive and user-friendly web interface to facilitate efficient and comprehensive search and browsing. The data can be easily sent to Galaxy instances, GREAT and Cistrome web-servers for downstream analysis, and can also be visualized in the UCSC genome browser where custom tracks can be added automatically. The data can be downloaded and exported in variety of formats. Furthermore, dbSUPER lists genes associated with super-enhancers and also links to external databases such as GeneCards, UniProt and Entrez. dbSUPER also provides an overlap analysis tool to annotate user-defined regions. We believe dbSUPER is a valuable resource for the biology and genetic research communities."

Scoring functions are a critically important component of computer-aided screening methods for the identification of lead compounds during early stages of drug discovery. Here, we present a new multigrid implementation of the footprint similarity (FPS) scoring function that was recently developed in our laboratory which has proven useful for identification of compounds which bind to a protein on a per-residue basis in a way that resembles a known reference. The grid-based FPS method is much faster than its Cartesian-space counterpart, which makes it computationally tractable for on-the-fly docking, virtual screening, or de novo design. In this work, we establish that: (i) relatively few grids can be used to accurately approximate Cartesian space footprint similarity, (ii) the method yields improved success over the standard DOCK energy function for pose identification across a large test set of experimental co-crystal structures, for crossdocking, and for database enrichment, and (iii) grid-based FPS scoring can be used to tailor construction of new molecules to have specific properties, as demonstrated in a series of test cases targeting the viral protein HIVgp41.

Selecting near-native conformations from the immense number of conformations generated by docking programs remains a major challenge in molecular docking. We introduce DockRank, a novel approach to scoring docked conformations based on the degree to which the interface residues of the docked conformation match a set of predicted interface residues. DockRank uses interface residues predicted by partner-specific sequence homology-based protein-protein interface predictor (PS-HomPPI), which predicts the interface residues of a query protein with a specific interaction partner. We compared the performance of DockRank with several state-of-the-art docking scoring functions using Success Rate (the percentage of cases that have at least one near-native conformation among the top m conformations) and Hit Rate (the percentage of near-native conformations that are included among the top m conformations). In cases where it is possible to obtain partner-specific (PS) interface predictions from PS-HomPPI, DockRank consistently outperforms both (i) ZRank and IRAD, two state-of-the-art energy-based scoring functions (improving Success Rate by up to 4-fold); and (ii) Variants of DockRank that use predicted interface residues obtained from several protein interface predictors that do not take into account the binding partner in making interface predictions (improving success rate by up to 39-fold). The latter result underscores the importance of using partner-specific interface residues in scoring docked conformations. We show that DockRank, when used to re-rank the conformations returned by ClusPro, improves upon the original ClusPro rankings in terms of both Success Rate and Hit Rate. DockRank is available as a server at http://einstein.cs.iastate.edu/DockRank/."

SUMMARY: The increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to thousands of human genomes having been sequenced in the past years. Efforts such as the 1000 Genomes Project further add to the availability of human genome variation data. However, to date, there is no method that can map reads of a newly sequenced human genome to a large collection of genomes. Instead, methods rely on aligning reads to a single reference genome. This leads to inherent biases and lower accuracy. To tackle this problem, a new alignment tool BWBBLE is introduced in this article. We (i) introduce a new compressed representation of a collection of genomes, which explicitly tackles the genomic variation observed at every position, and (ii) design a new alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform that maps short reads from a newly sequenced genome to an arbitrary collection of two or more (up to millions of) genomes with high accuracy and no inherent bias to one specific genome.

The deduced amino acid sequence of human junctin (210 aa) has 84% sequence identity to that of canine junctin identified previously. A human junctin isoform (isoform 1, 225 aa) was also identified and characterized. The isoform 1 has a 15 aa insertion at the amino acid residue 55 of the human junctin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human junctin was present both in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and the sizes of the transcripts were approximately 3.0 and 4.2kb. Amino acid residues 6-78 of human junctin and 35-107 of human aspartyl beta-hydroxylase (hAspH) overlapped perfectly. The gene copy number of human junctin and hASPH was investigated by genomic Southern blot analysis using various restriction enzymes and a common DNA probe.

PURPOSE: The available clinical data on target-specific oral anticoagulant (TSOAC) reversal agents that are currently in development or have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewed. SUMMARY: The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration. Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within 10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well tolerated in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs."

PURPOSE: Topoisomerase II alpha content, topoisomerase II catalytic activity and drug sensitivities to the topoisomerase II inhibitors, doxorubicin and etoposide, were examined in a panel of 14 unselected human lung cancer cell lines in order to determine the relationship between topoisomerase II and drug sensitivities to the topoisomerase II inhibitors. METHODS: Drug sensitivities were determined using a microculture tetrazolium assay. The topoisomerase II alpha levels were determined by Western blot analysis and the topoisomerase II catalytic activity was determined using a decatenation assay of kinetoplast DNA, using nuclear protein from cells of each cell line. RESULTS: Drug sensitivity tests revealed that small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines were more sensitive to drugs than non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The relative topoisomerase II alpha levels and relative topoisomerase II catalytic activity from SCLC cell lines (mean +/- SD 0.89 +/- 0.54 and 5.3 +/- 3.4, respectively) were slightly higher than those from NSCLC cell lines (0.78 +/- 0.56 and 4.0 +/- 2.8, respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant, and not sufficient to account for the variation in drug sensitivities. Moreover, no clear association was observed between the topoisomerase II alpha levels or the topoisomerase II catalytic activity and drug sensitivities in the cell lines studied. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the difference in drug sensitivities to doxorubicin and etoposide in human lung cancer cell lines might not be explainable by the topoisomerase II alpha levels and topoisomerase II catalytic activity. Moreover, our results suggest that the topoisomerase II alpha levels and topoisomerase II catalytic activity may play a minor role in the determination of clinical drug resistance of human lung cancers."

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and epidemiological aspects of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee. All patients admitted in the Dermatology ward of our tertiary care hospital with CADR (those who fit in the category of probable or possible drug reaction as per WHO casuality assessment) from first September 2011 to 31(st) August 2012 were included in this cross sectional study after obtaining written informed consent. The drug reaction patterns observed in the study population were determined and the common offending drugs were identified. RESULTS: In the study, population of males outnumbered females and the majority were between 46 and 60 years of age. The commonest reaction pattern observed was SJS- TEN spectrum of illness and aromatic anticonvulsants were the common offending drugs. Prompt withdrawal of the culprit drug and administration of systemic steroids with or without I/V Ig reverted the adverse reaction in all except one. CONCLUSION: Severe drug reactions predominated as the study population was comprised of inpatients of a tertiary referral centre. Though; previous authors had reported a mortality rate of up to 20% in DRESS, all our patients with this reaction pattern, responded well to treatment. The mortality rate among TEN cases was much lower than the previous reports. Early diagnosis, prompt withdrawal of the suspected drug, careful monitoring for development of complications and immediate intervention can improve the prognosis of CADR."

          "context": "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with gemcitabine: a case report and review of literature. CONTEXT: Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare condition compromising the clinical triad of acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be associated with a variety of etiologies, and chemotherapeutic agents have also been reported to be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, including mitomycin, cisplatin, bleomycin, and most recently gemcitabine. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old Caucasian male treated with four cycles of gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 developed clinical and laboratory findings compatible with hemolytic uremic syndrome. He developed microangiopathic hemolysis, rapidly declining renal function with proteinuria and hematuria, and renal biopsy revealed thrombotic microangiopathy. Hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, and corticosteroid therapy were utilized but the process ultimately was irreversible. CONCLUSION: With multiple reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome complicating gemcitabine therapy, it is imperative that clinicians heighten their awareness of this potentially lethal complication."
