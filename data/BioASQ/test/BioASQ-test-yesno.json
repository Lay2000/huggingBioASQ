BACKGROUND: A number of recent reports have suggested that the cystatin C/creatinine (CysC/Cr) ratio might be a useful biomarker of renal function in pediatric patients. In this study we investigated the reference intervals of the serum CysC/Cr ratio for neonates including very low birth weight infants. CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A total of 883 blood samples were collected from 246 neonates during the first 30 days of life for the concurrent measurement of serum CysC and Cr levels. Infants with symptoms or signs of acute kidney injury, systemic illness, congenital anomaly, or renal pathology were excluded. The association between serum CysC/Cr ratio and the subgroups of patients was also analyzed. Reference intervals of serum CysC/Cr ratio were determined according to the postnatal age and post-conceptional age (PCA). CysC/Cr ratio level increased according to PCA, except in the first three postnatal days. The serum CysC/Cr ratio correlated positively with gestational age at birth, birth weight, postnatal age, and PCA, and negatively with serum CysC and Cr (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reference levels of serum CysC/Cr ratio were determined according to postnatal age and PCA. As the serum CysC/Cr ratio is dependent on several clinical parameters, these should be considered when assessing the serum CysC/Cr ratio in neonates.",

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor overexpressed in 30% of human breast cancers. One of the mechanisms by which tumor cell proliferation can be inhibited consists in hampering HER2 dimerization by targeting its extracellular domain with specific antibodies. In recent clinical practice, a valuable alternative to entire IgGs resides in the use of smaller molecules, such as single-chain variable fragments (scFv), developed for selective molecular targeting. In this paper, we report on the production and purification of a soluble anti-HER2 scFv antibody secreted by Pichia pastoris. The gene encoding scFv800E6 with an additional 6\u00d7 His-tag at the 3'-end was inserted into the expression vector pPICZ\u03b1 and transformed in P. pastoris. The highest expression level was obtained in presence of 0.5% methanol and 0.8% glycerol in the culture medium after 48 h of induction. The use of P. pastoris proved very valuable as an expression system, allowing the isolation of 10 mg/L of highly purified antibody, remarkably higher than previously reported data. The functionality of purified anti-HER2 scFv was assessed by cytofluorimetry and immunofluorescence on HER2-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells, showing good affinity and high selectivity for the target membrane receptor. These findings confirm that P. pastoris is a suitable host for high level expression of antibody fragments and highlight the potential role of scFv800E6 in diagnostic and therapeutic application.",

AIMS: Mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channel, RyR2, underlie catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an inherited life-threatening arrhythmia. CPVT is triggered by spontaneous RyR2-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release in response to SR Ca(2+) overload during beta-adrenergic stimulation. However, whether elevated SR Ca(2+) content--in the absence of protein kinase A activation--affects RyR2 function and arrhythmogenesis in CPVT remains elusive. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated murine ventricular myocytes harbouring a human RyR2 mutation (RyR2(R4496C+/-)) associated with CPVT were investigated in the absence and presence of 1 micromol/L JTV-519 (RyR2 stabilizer) followed by 100 micromol/L ouabain intervention to increase cytosolic [Na(+)] and SR Ca(2+) load. Changes in membrane potential and intracellular [Ca(2+)] were monitored with whole-cell patch-clamping and confocal Ca(2+) imaging, respectively. At baseline, action potentials (APs), Ca(2+) transients, fractional SR Ca(2+) release, and SR Ca(2+) load were comparable in wild-type (WT) and RyR2(R4496C+/-) myocytes. Ouabain evoked significant increases in diastolic [Ca(2+)], peak systolic [Ca(2+)], fractional SR Ca(2+) release, and SR Ca(2+) content that were quantitatively similar in WT and RyR2(R4496C+/-) myocytes. Ouabain also induced arrhythmogenic events, i.e. spontaneous Ca(2+) waves, delayed afterdepolarizations and spontaneous APs, in both groups. However, the ouabain-induced increase in the frequency of arrhythmogenic events was dramatically larger in RyR2(R4496C+/-) when compared with WT myocytes. JTV-519 greatly reduced the frequency of ouabain-induced arrhythmogenic events. CONCLUSION: The elevation of SR Ca(2+) load--in the absence of beta-adrenergic stimulation--is sufficient to increase the propensity for triggered arrhythmias in RyR2(R4496C+/-) cardiomyocytes. Stabilization of RyR2 by JTV-519 effectively reduces these triggered arrhythmias.",

          "context": "Serum Proteomic Variability Associated with Clinical Phenotype in Familial Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTRm). Transthyretin (TTR), normally a plasma circulating protein, can become misfolded and aggregated, ultimately leading to extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils usually targeted to heart or nerve tissues. Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated. ATTR, caused by amyloid-forming variant TTR proteins (ATTRm) that arise from point mutations in the TTR gene, were classically referred to as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) or familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), reflecting the clinical phenotype. FAC and FAP are pathologies that can be challenging to diagnose as there are no definitive biomarkers of disease; moreover, disease-specific measures of progression are lacking, and treatment options are limited. Thus, the discovery of sensitive and specific indicators of disease has the potential to improve recognition, enable accurate measurement of amyloid progression and response to treatment, and reveal key information regarding FAC and FAP pathobiological mechanisms. In this study, the goal was to investigate serum proteomic features unique to FAC and FAP types of ATTRm. Multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS), a powerful technique in profiling proteomes, was used to measure the serum concentrations of 160 proteins in samples from FAC and FAP patients. Results were compared to data from healthy control sera obtained from individuals matched to age ( > 60 years), gender (male), and race (Caucasian). Proteomic analyses of ATTRm (FAC and FAP) and control samples showed significant concentration differences in 107 of 192 (56%) of the serum proteins that were studied. In comparing FAC to FAP, differences in concentrations as well as interactions and functions of several proteins were identified as unique to each disease; significantly lower levels of TTR were specific to FAC, but not to FAP. Annotated functional clustering identified extracellular region, signal, and signal peptide as terms common to FAC and FAP. Conversely, disulfide bond was unique to FAC; secreted, glycosylation site: N-linked, glycosylation, glycoprotein, polymorphism, and sequence variant were associated solely with FAP. Predicted protein-protein associations in FAC were seen for reaction, binding, and activation processes; no associations were found in FAP. This study demonstrates significant proteomic differences between ATTRm patient and control sera, as well as ATTRm phenotype-associated variations in the circulating levels of several proteins including TTR. The identification of serum proteins unique to FAC and FAP may have diagnostic and prognostic utility and could possibly provide important clues about disease mechanisms.",

          "context": "Loss of Parp-1 affects gene expression profile in a genome-wide manner in ES cells and liver cells. BACKGROUND: Many lines of evidence suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1) is involved in transcriptional regulation of various genes as a coactivator or a corepressor by modulating chromatin structure. However, the impact of Parp-1-deficiency on the regulation of genome-wide gene expression has not been fully studied yet. RESULTS: We employed a microarray analysis covering 12,488 genes and ESTs using mouse Parp-1-deficient (Parp-1-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cell lines and the livers of Parp-1-/- mice and their wild-type (Parp-1+/+) counterparts. Here, we demonstrate that of the 9,907 genes analyzed, in Parp-1-/- ES cells, 9.6% showed altered gene expression. Of these, 6.3% and 3.3% of the genes were down- or up-regulated by 2-fold or greater, respectively, compared with Parp-1+/+ ES cells (p < 0.05). In the livers of Parp-1-/- mice, of the 12,353 genes that were analyzed, 2.0% or 1.3% were down- and up-regulated, respectively (p < 0.05). Notably, the number of down-regulated genes was higher in both ES cells and livers, than that of the up-regulated genes. The genes that showed altered expression in ES cells or in the livers are ascribed to various cellular processes, including metabolism, signal transduction, cell cycle control and transcription. We also observed expression of the genes involved in the pathway of extraembryonic tissue development is augmented in Parp-1-/- ES cells, including H19. After withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor, expression of H19 as well as other trophoblast marker genes were further up-regulated in Parp-1-/- ES cells compared to Parp-1+/+ ES cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Parp-1 is required to maintain transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes on a genome-wide scale. The gene expression profiles in Parp-1-deficient cells may be useful to delineate the functional role of Parp-1 in epigenetic regulation of the genomes involved in various biological phenomena.",

INTRODUCTION: Statins have been studied in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but the history, pharmacology, and studies have not been reviewed recently. METHODS: The development of statins as well as their biological effects and pharmacology are reviewed. Recent clinical studies in patients with SAH are summarized. RESULTS: Statins lower serum cholesterol but they also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, angiogenic, neuroprotective, vasoprotective, and endothelial preserving actions. In patients with SAH, they may decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, although the effects on overall outcome are less clear. They should be continued in patients who are taking them on admission and perhaps initiated in those who have indications for them. Side effects are rare. CONCLUSION: A large randomized, double-blind clinical trial is needed before it can be determined that statins are beneficial for patients with aneurysmal SAH.",

OBJECTIVE: This article summarizes the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) review of the New Drug Application for vortioxetine, especially the clinical efficacy and safety data. It emphasizes the issues that were important to the FDA's approval decision, particularly the difference in the effective dose in domestic and foreign studies, and notes several new labeling features, specifically, description of time course of treatment response and detailed sexual dysfunction evaluation. DATA SOURCES: The data sources were the original raw data sets for all clinical trials included in the development program for vortioxetine, as well as the sponsor's original analyses of these data. Data were available from 51 human trials involving vortioxetine, and included a total of 7,666 healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to at least 1 dose of vortioxetine for a total of 2,743 patient-years. RESULTS: Vortioxetine was effective in treating MDD in the United States at a dose of 20 mg/d. The recommended starting dose is 10 mg once daily without regard to food, with increase to 20 mg/d if the 10 mg/d dose is tolerated. For patients who do not tolerate 20 mg/d, 10 mg/d can be used and 5-mg/d dose can be considered. Vortioxetine can be discontinued abruptly, but it is recommended that doses of 15 mg/d or 20 mg/d be reduced to 10 mg/d for 1 week prior to full discontinuation to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms. Although the non-US maintenance study showed that maintenance doses of 5 to 10 mg/d were effective, a clinical judgment needs to be made to decide the maintenance dose in the United States. The applicant has agreed to conduct a US maintenance dose-response study covering the US-approved dose range. Vortioxetine's adverse event profile is similar to that of other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Nausea is the most common adverse event and is dose dependent. No dose adjustment is needed based on age, gender, or the presence of renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg/d in known cytochrome P450 2D6 poor metabolizers. CONCLUSIONS: Vortioxetine is a new treatment for MDD, and its adverse event profile is similar to that of other SSRIs.",

Metazoan genomes contain many ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), long sequences identical between distant species. In this study we identified UCEs in drosophilid and vertebrate species with a similar level of phylogenetic divergence measured at protein-coding regions, and demonstrated that both the length and number of UCEs are larger in vertebrates. The proportion of non-exonic UCEs declines in distant drosophilids whilst an opposite trend was observed in vertebrates. We generated a set of 2,126 Sophophora UCEs by merging elements identified in several drosophila species and compared these to the eutherian UCEs identified in placental mammals. In contrast to vertebrates, the Sophophora UCEs are depleted around transcription start sites. Analysis of 52,954 P-element, piggyBac and Minos insertions in the D. melanogaster genome revealed depletion of the P-element and piggyBac insertions in and around the Sophophora UCEs. We examined eleven fly strains with transposon insertions into the intergenic UCEs and identified associated phenotypes in five strains. Four insertions behave as recessive lethals, and in one case we observed a suppression of the marker gene within the transgene, presumably by silenced chromatin around the integration site. To confirm the lethality is caused by integration of transposons we performed a phenotype rescue experiment for two stocks and demonstrated that the excision of the transposons from the intergenic UCEs restores viability. Sequencing of DNA after the transposon excision in one fly strain with the restored viability revealed a 47 bp insertion at the original transposon integration site suggesting that the nature of the mutation is important for the appearance of the phenotype. Our results suggest that the UCEs in flies and vertebrates have both common and distinct features, and demonstrate that a significant proportion of intergenic drosophila UCEs are sensitive to disruption.",

Unlike early stage breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is generally considered incurable except for a small number of patients with oligometastatic disease. The goal of treatment of MBC should be the prolongation of life and improvement of symptoms and quality of life. The prognoses of patients with MBC, however, have been improved with the introduction of newer, more effective agents. Therefore, the clinical question arises whether MBC patients can be cured with these new therapeutic agents. However, there are a couple of problems in tackling this question, including the duration of follow-up and the presence of strong adjuvant therapy. Firstly, most trials in MBC have a relatively short follow-up; long-term surveillance (>3-5\u00a0years) is exceptional, so little is known about the definitive outcome and the exact proportion of long-term survivors. Secondly, most of the patients have received pre- or postoperative adjuvant therapy. The cancer cells at metastatic sites are considered to be relatively resistant to the agents used in metastatic settings. Promisingly, a number of novel therapeutic agents including antibody-drug conjugates, irreversible small molecule HER2-tyrosine inhibitors, and HER2 dimerization inhibitors show promise in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing MBC, as well as PARP-1 [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1] inhibitors for triple-negative breast cancer.",

Human multipotent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease, type 1 diabetes, bone fractures, cartilage damage, and cardiac diseases. Despite remarkable progress in clinical trials, most applications still use traditional culture media containing fetal bovine serum or serum-free media that contain serum albumin, insulin, and transferrin. The ill-defined and variable nature of traditional culture media remains a challenge and has created a need for better defined xeno-free culture media to meet the regulatory and long-term safety requirements for cell-based therapies. We developed and tested a serum-free and xeno-free culture medium (SFM-XF) using human bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs by investigating primary cell isolation, multiple passage expansion, mesoderm differentiation, cellular phenotype, and gene expression analysis, which are critical for complying with translation to cell therapy. Human MSCs expanded in SFM-XF showed continual propagation, with an expected phenotype and differentiation potential to adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages similar to that of MSCs expanded in traditional serum-containing culture medium (SCM). To monitor global gene expression, the transcriptomes of bone marrow-derived MSCs expanded in SFM-XF and SCM were compared, revealing relatively similar expression profiles. In addition, the SFM-XF supported the isolation and propagation of human MSCs from primary human marrow aspirates, ensuring that these methods and reagents are compatible for translation to therapy. The SFM-XF culture system allows better expansion and multipotentiality of MSCs and serves as a preferred alternative to serum-containing media for the production of large scale, functionally competent MSCs for future clinical applications.",

The ketone bodies \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) support mammalian survival during states of energy deficit by serving as alternative sources of ATP. BHB levels are elevated by starvation, caloric restriction, high-intensity exercise, or the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. Prolonged fasting reduces inflammation; however, the impact that ketones and other alternative metabolic fuels produced during energy deficits have on the innate immune response is unknown. We report that BHB, but neither AcAc nor the structurally related short-chain fatty acids butyrate and acetate, suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to urate crystals, ATP and lipotoxic fatty acids. BHB did not inhibit caspase-1 activation in response to pathogens that activate the NLR family, CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) or absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome and did not affect non-canonical caspase-11, inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing K(+) efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation. The inhibitory effects of BHB on NLRP3 are not dependent on chirality or starvation-regulated mechanisms like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy or glycolytic inhibition. BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). BHB reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production in human monocytes. In vivo, BHB or a ketogenic diet attenuates caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion in mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases such as Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and urate crystal-induced peritonitis.

RESULTS: Five trials involving 482 patients were included in the review. Magnesium sulfate reduced the risk of poor outcome and reduced the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia. In the treatment groups, relative risk for poor outcome was 0.73 (CI 0.57-0.93) and 0.66 (CI 0.47-0.92) for delayed cerebral ischemia. Case fatality assessment at three to six months did not show statistically significant data (RR 0.88; CI 0.61-1.29).

Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) have emerged as important anti-cell death mediators, particularly in cancer. Although they are known to be expressed in immune tissue, their specific immune function remains unclear. We observed that degradation of cIAPs with SMAC mimetic (SM) results in death of primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages. SM-induced death of macrophages occurred by programmed necrosis (necroptosis), which was dependent on TNF receptor expression. Consistent with necroptosis, SM-induced death of macrophages was abrogated by inhibition of receptor interacting protein 1 (Rip1) kinase signaling or by receptor interacting protein 3 (Rip3) knockdown. SM-induced necroptosis was also dependent on inhibition of SM-induced apoptosis due to the expression of the endogenous caspase inhibitor, xIAP. We found that cIAPs limit Rip3, and to a lesser extent Rip1, expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms, leading to inhibition of the Rip1-Rip3 death complex (necrosome). Reduced cIAP activity in vivo, via SM treatment or specific knockout of either cIAP, resulted in elevated macrophage cell death and compromised control of an intracellular bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes. These results show that cIAPs have an important role in limiting programmed necrosis of macrophages, which facilitates effective control of a pathogen.",

A homogeneous group of 214 infertile women with endometriosis treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1960 to 1979 received conservative surgery as the sole therapeutic modality. Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child. Among 49 patients with secondary infertility, the spontaneous abortion rate was reduced from 49% to 20% after conservative surgery (P less than or equal to 0.01). Three contemporary classification systems were utilized to categorize patients according to the sites and amount of endometriosis at the time of conservative surgery. Those systems suggested by Buttram (Fertil Steril 30:240, 1978) and by Kistner and coauthors (Fertil Steril 28:108, 1977) revealed differences among fecundability rates among the different categories (P less than or equal to 0.01); however, the system suggested by The American Fertility Society (AFS) (Fertil Steril 32:633, 1979) revealed significant differences only if categories were combined (mild plus moderate versus severe plus extensive, P less than or equal to 0.05). Nevertheless, the AFS system revealed that pregnancy success was significantly reduced if an ovarian endometrioma was greater than 3 cm or had ruptured (P less than or equal to 0.01).",

P-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion molecule, whose expression is highly associated with undifferentiated cells in normal adult epithelial tissues, as well as with poorly differentiated carcinomas. Its expression has been already reported in human embryonic stem cells and it is presumed to be a marker of stem or progenitor cells of some epithelial tissues. In normal breast, P-cadherin has an essential role during ductal mammary branching, being expressed by the monolayer of epithelial cap cells at the end buds. In mature mammary tissue, its expression is restricted to the myoepithelium; it has been postulated that it may also be present in early luminal progenitor cells. In breast cancer, P-cadherin is frequently overexpressed in high-grade tumours, being a well-established indicator of poor patient prognosis. It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. Considering P-cadherin's role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis formation, a humanized monoclonal antibody was recently produced to antagonize P-cadherin-associated signalling pathways, which is currently under Phase I clinical trials. In this review, the most important findings about the role of P-cadherin in normal breast development and cancer will be illustrated and discussed, with emphasis on the most recent data.",

The effect of a 21-day treatment with the dual 5-HT and NE reuptake blocker venlafaxine (delivered s.c. by osmotic minipumps) was assessed on the time required for a 50% recovery (RT(50)) of the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons from the suppression induced by microiontophoretic applications of 5-HT and NE. The RT(50) values for 5-HT were increased by both 10 and 40 mg/kg/day regimens of venlafaxine, whereas those for NE were increased only by the 40 mg/kg/day regimen, indicative of a greater potency of venlafaxine in blocking 5-HT reuptake. The sensitivity of the postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors was altered by neither regimen of venlafaxine. Using a paradigm by which the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635 can induce a disinhibition of firing activity of CA(3) pyramidal neurons, it was demonstrated that the high, but not the low, dose of venlafaxine led to an enhanced tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. The duration of the suppressant effect of the firing activity of CA(3) hippocampus pyramidal neurons produced by the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway was significantly reduced when the frequency of the stimulation was enhanced from 1 Hz to 5 Hz in control rats and in rats treated with 10 mg/kg/day, but not with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. Hence, venlafaxine induced a desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor only at the high dose. A 2-day treatment with 10 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine induced a suppression of the firing activity of 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe. The firing activity of these neurons was back to control level in rats that had been treated for 21 days with the same dose of venlafaxine. The suppressant effect of the i.v. administration of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist LSD on the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was reduced in rats that had been treated for 21 days with 10 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. A 2-day treatment with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine, unlike the 10 mg/kg/day regimen, induced a marked suppression of the firing activity of locus coeruleus NE neurons. However, in contrast to 5-HT neurons, NE neurons did not recover their firing activity after a 21-day treatment. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. Moreover, an enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission by venlafaxine was only achieved under conditions whereby the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor is appended to that of the somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptor.",

Transgenic (TG) Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) \u03b4(C) mice develop systolic heart failure (HF). CaMKII regulates intracellular Ca(2+) handling proteins as well as sarcolemmal Na(+) channels. We hypothesized that CaMKII also contributes to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias via augmentation of the late Na(+) current (late I(Na)) in early HF (8-week-old TG mice). Echocardiography revealed severe diastolic dysfunction in addition to decreased systolic ejection fraction. Premature arrhythmogenic contractions (PACs) in isolated isometrically twitching papillary muscles only occurred in TG preparations (5 vs. 0, P < 0.05) which could be completely terminated when treated with the late I(Na) inhibitor ranolazine (Ran, 5 \u03bcmol/L). Force-frequency relationships revealed significantly reduced twitch force amplitudes in TG papillary muscles. Most importantly, diastolic tension increased with raising frequencies to a greater extent in TG papillary muscles compared to WT specimen (at 10 Hz: 3.7 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 2.5 \u00b1 0.3 mN/mm\u00b2; P < 0.05). Addition of Ran improved diastolic dysfunction to 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 mN/mm\u00b2 (at 10 Hz; P < 0.05) without negative inotropic effects. Mechanistically, the late I(Na) was markedly elevated in myocytes isolated from TG mice and could be completely reversed by Ran. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that TG CaMKII\u03b4(C) overexpression induces diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmogenic triggers possibly via an enhanced late I(Na). Inhibition of elevated late I(Na) had beneficial effects on arrhythmias as well as diastolic function in papillary muscles from CaMKII\u03b4(C) TG mice. Thus, late I(Na) inhibition appears to be a promising option for diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias in HF where CaMKII is found to be increased.",

PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models. We\u00a0evaluated the addition of VPA to standard radiation therapy (RT) plus temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed GBM were enrolled between July 2006 and April 2013. Patients received VPA, 25\u00a0mg/kg orally, divided into 2 daily doses concurrent with RT and TMZ. The first dose of VPA was given 1\u00a0week before the first day of RT at 10 to 15\u00a0mg/kg/day and subsequently increased up to 25\u00a0mg/kg/day over the week prior to radiation. VPA- and TMZ-related acute toxicities were evaluated using Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 (National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) and Cancer Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme for toxicity and adverse event reporting (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment). RESULTS: A total of 81% of patients took VPA according to protocol. Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6\u00a0months (range: 21-63.8\u00a0months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5\u00a0months (range: 6.8-51.2\u00a0months). OS at 6, 12, and 24\u00a0months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and 24\u00a0months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities of VPA in conjunction with RT/TMZ therapy were blood and bone marrow toxicity (32%), neurological toxicity (11%), and metabolic and laboratory toxicity (8%). Younger\u00a0age and class V recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) results were significant for both OS and PFS. VPA levels were not correlated with grade 3 or 4 toxicity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: To assess the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and incontinence in female athletes and to determine the etiological factors. METHODS: An anonymous self-questionnaire was collected from 623 casual female athletes aged 18 to 56 years, who were involved in 12 different sports. The surveys were distributed by hand to the athletes, during their sports fitness tests, in a sports center. We investigated the relationship between urinary disorders and factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), parity, duration of physical exercise, and type of sport. RESULTS: The prevalence of LUTS was 54.7%, and 30% for urinary incontinence. Changes in urinary frequency were detected in 91 (14.6%) women. Prevalence of dysuria was 13.3%, urinary straining was present in 173 (27.8%) athletes, whereas urinary urgency had an estimated prevalence of 37.2% with 232 athletes suffering from this disorder. Urgency was very common in volleyball players, as was dysuria among hockey and basketball players, whereas straining mainly affected aerobic participants and cyclists. Long training hours and competitive practices were correlated with the onset of LUTS. High-impact sports were more frequently associated with incontinence, while low-impact sports with LUTS. The sport with the main number of incontinent people was football. Urge incontinence affected a lot of athletes, mainly cyclists and football players. Stress incontinence was more frequent in hockey and volleyball players. CONCLUSIONS: LUTS and incontinence are prevalent in female athletes. In many cases, the disorders were present only during sports activities. In this sample, the presence of urinary disorders did not seem to be a barrier during sports or exercise.",

Phospholamban (PLN) reversibly inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) through a direct protein-protein interaction, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in heart muscle cells. The interaction between PLN and SERCA2a occurs at multiple sites within the cytoplasmic and membrane domains. Here, we have reconstituted the cytoplasmic protein-protein interaction using bacterially expressed fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of PLN and the long cytoplasmic loop of SERCA2a. We have developed two methods to evaluate the binding of the fusion proteins, one with glutathione-Sepharose beads and the other with a 96-well plate. Essentially the same results were obtained by the two methods. The affinity of the binding (K(D)) was 0.70 microM. The association was inhibited by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the PLN fusion protein and by usage of anti-PLN monoclonal antibody. It was also diminished by substitution at the phosphorylation site of PLN of Ser(16) to Asp. These results suggest that PLN can bind SERCA2a in the absence of the membrane domains and that the modifications of the cytoplasmic domain of PLN that activate SERCA2a parallel the disruption of the association between the two fusion proteins. It has been shown that the removal of PLN inhibition of SERCA2a rescues cardiac function and morphology in the mouse dilated cardiomyopathy model.

HER activation is driven by the formation of various dimer complexes between members of this receptor family. The HER dimer types can have differential effects on downstream signaling and phenotypic outcomes. We constructed an integrated mathematical model of HER activation, and trafficking to quantitatively link receptor expression levels to dimerization and activation. We parameterized the model with a comprehensive set of HER phosphorylation and abundance data collected in a panel of human mammary epithelial cells expressing varying levels of EGFR/HER1, HER2 and HER3. Although parameter estimation yielded multiple solutions, predictions for dimer phosphorylation were in agreement with each other. We validated the model using experiments where pertuzumab was used to block HER2 dimerization. We used the model to predict HER dimerization and activation patterns in a panel of human mammary epithelial cells lines with known HER expression levels in response to stimulations with ligands EGF and HRG. Simulations over the range of expression levels seen in various cell lines indicate that: i) EGFR phosphorylation is driven by HER1-HER1 and HER1-HER2 dimers, and not HER1-HER3 dimers, ii) HER1-HER2 and HER2-HER3 dimers both contribute significantly to HER2 activation with the EGFR expression level determining the relative importance of these species, and iii) the HER2-HER3 dimer is largely responsible for HER3 activation.

The ubiquitin proteolytic system plays a major role in a variety of basic cellular processes. In the majority of these processes, the target proteins are completely degraded. In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degraded. The identity of the mechanisms involved in this unique process have remained elusive. It has been shown that a Gly-rich region (GRR) at the C-terminal domain of p50 is an important processing signal. Here we show that the GRR does not interfere with conjugation of ubiquitin to p105 but probably does interfere with the processing of the ubiquitin-tagged precursor by the 26S proteasome. Structural analysis reveals that a short sequence containing a few Gly residues and a single essential Ala is sufficient to generate p50. Mechanistically, the presence of the GRR appears to stop further degradation of p50 and to stabilize the molecule. It appears that the localization of the GRR within p105 plays an important role in directing processing: transfer of the GRR within p105 or insertion of the GRR into homologous or heterologous proteins is not sufficient to promote processing in most cases, which is probably due to the requirement for an additional specific ubiquitination and/or recognition domain(s). Indeed, we have shown that amino acid residues 441 to 454 are important for processing. In particular, both Lys 441 and Lys 442 appear to serve as major ubiquitination targets, while residues 446 to 454 are independently important for processing and may serve as the ubiquitin ligase recognition motif.",

Data from several studies suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may play a role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Here, we examined the potential role of the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD (cylindromatosis), mutation of which has been reported to cause familial cylindromatosis. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of CYLD mRNA in the aorta, as well as in cultured human aortic endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells. Treatment with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha significantly increased CYLD expression in ECs and vascular smooth muscle cells. Immunostaining showed CYLD expression in atherosclerotic lesions from human carotid arteries and up-regulation of CYLD expression in the neointima of rat carotid arteries after balloon injury. Overexpression of CYLD in ECs resulted in inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activity through deubiquitination of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), whereas overexpression of catalytically inactive CYLD had no effect. CYLD overexpression also inhibited expression of cyclin D1 and activation of the E2F pathway through deubiquitination of the upstream molecule Bcl-3 and inhibition of its translocation into the nucleus. Overexpressed CYLD also significantly inhibited cell viability. Furthermore, overexpression of CYLD in rat balloon-injured carotid artery attenuated neointimal formation through inactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB and E2F. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD may inhibit inflammation and proliferation in vascular cells and may represent a novel target for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis.",

Low rates of replication errors in chromosomal genes of Sulfolobus spp. demonstrate that these extreme thermoacidophiles can maintain genome integrity in environments with high temperature and low pH.

The resulting Lac(-) mutants also grew faster than the Lac(+) parent, thereby amplifying the impact of the frequent lacS mutations on the population. We developed a mutant accumulation assay and corrections for the effects of copy number and differential growth for this system; the resulting measurements and calculations yielded a corrected rate of 5.1 \u00d7 10(-4) mutational events at the lacS gene per plasmid replication. Analysis of independent lacS mutants revealed three types of mutations: (i) G \u00b7 C-to-A \u00b7 T transitions, (ii) slipped-strand events, and (iii) deletions. These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. Substitution mutations arose at only two of 12 potential priming sites of the DNA primase of the pRN1 replicon, but nearly all these mutations created nonsense (chain termination) codons. The spontaneous mutation rate of plasmid-borne lacS was 175-fold higher under high-expression than under low-expression conditions. The results suggest that important DNA repair or replication fidelity functions are impaired or overwhelmed in pJlacS, with results analogous to those of the \"transcription-associated mutagenesis\" seen in bacteria and eukaryotes.",

However, the precise biological function and molecular mechanism of miR-21 in GBM remain elusive. This study is designed to explore the mechanism of miR-21 involved in the control of GBM cell growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis analysis showed that reduction of miR-21 inhibited cell growth in U87 and LN229 GBM cells. Further, reduction of miR-21 decreased the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and repressed STAT3 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 inhibition led to a remarkable depletion of hTERT at both mRNA and protein levels by binding to the hTERT gene promoter by performing luciferase reporter assay and chromatin Immunoprecipitation PCR. Finally, knockdown of miR-21 considerably inhibited tumor growth and diminished the expression of STAT3 and hTERT in xenograft model. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that miR-21 regulates hTERT expression mediated by STAT3, therefore controlling GBM cell growth.",

Stress granules (SG) are membrane-less compartments involved in regulating mRNAs during stress. Aberrant forms of SGs have been implicated in age-related diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the molecular events triggering their formation are still unknown. Here, we find that misfolded proteins, such as ALS-linked variants of SOD1, specifically accumulate and aggregate within SGs in human cells. This decreases the dynamics of SGs, changes SG composition, and triggers an aberrant liquid-to-solid transition of in\u00a0vitro reconstituted compartments. We show that chaperone recruitment prevents the formation of aberrant SGs and promotes SG disassembly when the stress subsides. Moreover, we identify a backup system for SG clearance, which involves transport of aberrant SGs to the aggresome and their degradation by autophagy. Thus, cells employ a system of SG quality control to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins and maintain the dynamic state of SGs, which may have relevance for ALS and related diseases.",

Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. Bulbocapnine, which differs from dicentrine only by the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 11 and the absence of a methoxyl group at position 9, was inactive in all assays. Molecular modeling showed that dicentrine can attain a relatively planar conformation, whereas bulbocapnine cannot, due to steric interaction between the 11-hydroxyl group and an oxygen of the methylenedioxy ring. These observations suggest that dicentrine is an \"adaptive\" DNA intercalator, which can bind DNA only by adopting a somewhat strained planar conformation. The requirement of a suboptimal conformation to achieve DNA binding appears to make dicentrine a weaker topoisomerase II inhibitor than the very planar oxoaporphine alkaloid liriodenine.

The objectives of this European Expert Panel meeting were to describe the optimal management and best practice for the systemic adjuvant treatment of patients with primary GISTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A panel of medical oncology experts from European sarcoma research groups were invited to a 1-day workshop. Several questions and discussion points were selected by the organising committee prior to the conference. The experts reviewed the current literature of all clinical trials available on adjuvant therapy for primary GISTs, considered the quality evidence and formulated recommendations for each discussion point. RESULTS: Clinical issues were identified and provisional clinical opinions were formulated for adjuvant treatment patient selection, imatinib dose, duration and patient recall, mutational analysis and follow-up of primary GIST patients. Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs. Patient selection for adjuvant therapy should be based on any of the three commonly used patient risk stratification schemes. R1 surgery (versus R0) alone is not an indication for adjuvant imatinib in low-risk GIST. Recall and imatinib restart could be proposed in patients who discontinued 1-year adjuvant imatinib within the previous 3 months and may be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients who discontinued within the previous year. Mutational analysis is recommended in all cases of GISTs using centralised laboratories with good quality control. Treatment is not recommended in an imatinib-insensitive D842V-mutated GIST. During adjuvant treatment, patients are recommended to be clinically assessed at 1- to 3-month intervals. Upon discontinuation, computed tomography scan (CT) scans are recommended every 3 to 4 months for 2 years when the risk of relapse is highest, followed by every 6 months until year 5 and annually until year 10 after treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Key points in systemic adjuvant treatment and clinical management of primary GISTs as well as open questions were identified during this European Expert Panel meeting on GIST management.",

However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E \u03f54 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug. Solanezumab, another humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, was shown to neutralize soluble A\u03b2 oligomers, which is believed to be the more neurotoxic A\u03b2 species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting A\u03b2 may not be clinically efficacious in AD. The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab and two Phase III trials on solanezumab will tell us if passive anti-A\u03b2 immunization is able to alter the course of this devastating disease, and if A\u03b2 is still a viable target for anti-AD drugs.",

Background Findings from clinical trials of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have led to concern that these drugs or the low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that result from their use are associated with cognitive deficits. Methods In a subgroup of patients from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, we prospectively assessed cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The primary end point was the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (scores range from 4 to 28, with lower scores indicating a more efficient use of strategy and planning). Secondary end points were the scores for working memory (scores range from 0 to 279, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), episodic memory (scores range from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), and psychomotor speed (scores range from 100 to 5100 msec, with faster times representing better performance). Assessments of cognitive function were performed at baseline, week 24, yearly, and at the end of the trial. The primary analysis was a noninferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline in the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function between the patients who received evolocumab and those who received placebo; the noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the standard deviation of the score in the placebo group. Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (\u00b1SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21\u00b12.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29\u00b12.81 in the placebo group (P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of scores for working memory (change in raw score, -0.52 in the evolocumab group and -0.93 in the placebo group), episodic memory (change in raw score, -1.53 and -1.53, respectively), or psychomotor speed (change in raw score, 5.2 msec and 0.9 msec, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, there were no associations between LDL cholesterol levels and cognitive changes. Conclusions In a randomized trial involving patients who received either evolocumab or placebo in addition to statin therapy, no significant between-group difference in cognitive function was observed over a median of 19 months.

Rgnef (also known as p190RhoGEF or ARHGEF28) is a Rho guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) that binds focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK is recruited to adhesions and activated by integrin receptors binding to matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (FN). Canonical models place Rgnef downstream of integrin-FAK signaling in regulating Rho GTPase activity and cell movement. Herein, we establish a new, upstream role for Rgnef in enhancing FAK localization to early peripheral adhesions and promoting FAK activation upon FN binding. Rgnef-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit defects in adhesion formation, levels of FAK phosphotyrosine (pY)-397 and FAK localization to peripheral adhesions upon re-plating on FN. Rgnef re-expression rescues these defects, but requires Rgnef-FAK binding. A mutation in the Rgnef pleckstrin homology (PH) domain inhibits adhesion formation, FAK localization, and FAK-Y397 and paxillin-Y118 phosphorylation without disrupting the Rgnef-FAK interaction. A GEF-inactive Rgnef mutant rescues FAK-Y397 phosphorylation and early adhesion localization, but not paxillin-Y118 phosphorylation. This suggests that, downstream of FN binding, paxillin-pY118 requires Rgnef GEF activity through a mechanism distinct from adhesion formation and FAK activation. These results support a scaffolding role for Rgnef in FAK localization and activation at early adhesions in a PH-domain-dependent but GEF-activity-independent manner.",

BACKGROUND: About half of patients with papillary thyroid cancer have tumours with activating BRAF(V600E) mutations. Vemurafenib, an oncogenic BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for BRAF-positive melanoma, showed clinical benefit in three patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer in a phase 1 trial. We aimed to establish the activity of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer. METHODS: We did an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial at ten academic centres and hospitals worldwide in patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine and positive for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Participants either had never received a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR (cohort 1) or had been treated previously with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor (cohort 2). Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed best overall response in cohort 1 (confirmed on two assessments 4 weeks or longer apart). Analyses were planned to have a minimum median follow-up of 15 months (data cutoff April 18, 2014) and were done in safety, intention-to-treat, and per-protocol populations. This trial is closed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01286753. FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2011, and Jan 15, 2013, 51 patients were enrolled to the study, 26 in cohort 1 and 25 in cohort 2. Median duration of follow-up was 18\u00b78 months (IQR 14\u00b72-26\u00b70) in cohort 1 and 12\u00b70 months (6\u00b77-20\u00b73) in cohort 2. Partial responses were recorded in ten of 26 patients in cohort 1 (best overall response 38\u00b75%, 95% CI 20\u00b72-59\u00b74). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 17 (65%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2; the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (seven [27%] in cohort 1, five [20%] in cohort 2), lymphopenia (two [8%] in each cohort), and increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (one [4%] in cohort 1, three [12%] in cohort 2). Two individuals in cohort 2 died due to adverse events, one from dyspnoea and one from multiorgan failure, but neither was treatment related. Serious adverse events were reported for 16 (62%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2. INTERPRETATION: Vemurafenib showed antitumour activity in patients with progressive, BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine who had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor. As such, this agent represents a potential new treatment option for these patients. FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.",

BACKGROUND: Heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HHHFNC) has been used to improve ventilation in preterm infants. There are no data on airway pressures generated and efficacy in bronchiolitis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine nasopharyngeal (NP) pressures generated with HHHFNC therapy in bronchiolitis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study to measure NP pressures at varying flow rates of HHHFNC therapy in moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Vital signs, bronchiolitis severity scores, and oxygen saturation were also noted. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled (mean, 78.1 [SD, 30.9] days; weight, 5.3 [SD, 1.1] kg). Nasopharyngeal pressures increased linearly with flow rates up to 6 L/min. Beyond 6 L/min, pressure increase was linear but less accelerated. On average, NP pressure increased by 0.45 cm H2O for each 1-L/min increase in flow rate. There were significant differences between pressures in open- and closed-mouth states for flow rates up to 6 L/min. At 6 L/min, the pressure in open-mouth state was 2.47 cm H2O and that in closed-mouth state was 2.74 cm H2O (P < 0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that only flow (not weight or gender) had an effect on generated pressure. Bronchiolitis severity scores improved significantly with HHHFNC therapy (pre: 14.5 [SD, 1.4], post: 10.4 [SD, 1.2]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing flow rates of HHHFNC therapy are associated with linear increases in NP pressures in bronchiolitis patients. Larger studies are needed to assess the clinical efficacy of HHHFNC therapy in bronchiolitis.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of maternal plasma samples collected from pregnant Chinese women in early gestation, between 8 + 0 and 12 + 6 weeks' gestation. METHODS: In this pilot study, 212 women with high-risk pregnancies were recruited at a single Chinese Hospital. Fetal aneuploidies associated with chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y were detected by massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma DNA samples. Invasive prenatal diagnosis by either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis and then karyotyping was offered to all women to confirm both positive and negative NIPT results. Fetal DNA fraction was also determined in male pregnancies, by the relative percentage of Y-chromosome sequences. All confirmed NIPT-negative pregnancies were followed up to birth and neonates were clinically evaluated for any symptoms of chromosomal disease. RESULTS: Autosomal aneuploidies trisomy 21 (n = 2), 18 (n = 1) and 13 (n = 1) were detected by NIPT and confirmed by amniocentesis and karyotyping. There were one false-positive 45,X sample and two false-negative samples associated with fetal karyotypes 47,XXY and 45,X[16]/47,XXX[14]. In the 100 male pregnancies, the median fetal DNA fraction was 8.54% and there was a trend towards an increasing fetal fraction from 8 + 0 to 12 + 6 weeks' gestation. The majority (95%) of pregnancies had a fetal DNA fraction > 4%, which is generally the limit for accurate aneuploidy detection by NIPT. Across this early gestational time period, there was a weak inverse relationship (R(2) = 0.186) between fetal DNA fraction and maternal weight. CONCLUSIONS: NIPT is highly reliable and accurate when applied to maternal DNA samples collected from pregnant women in the first trimester between 8 + 0 and 12 + 6 weeks.",

RNA-seq identified thousands of circRNAs with developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression corroborating earlier suggestions that circular isoforms are a natural feature of the cell expression program. CircRNAs are abundantly expressed also in the hematopoietic compartment. There are a number of studies on circRNAs in blood cells, a specific overview is however lacking. In this review we first present current insight in circRNA biogenesis discussing the relevance for hematopoiesis of the highly interleaved processes of splicing and circRNA biogenesis. Regarding molecular functions circRNAs modulate host gene expression, but also compete for binding of microRNAs, RNA-binding proteins or translation initiation and participate in regulatory circuits. We examine circRNA expression in the hematopoietic compartment and in hematologic malignancies and review the recent breakthrough study that identified pathogenic circRNAs derived from leukemia fusion genes.

AIM: To study an association between clinical and morphological evidence and the serum and daily urinary levels of cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in patients with primary glomerulopathies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients; morphological examination showed minimal change disease in 15 (14.4%) patients, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 24 (23.1%), membrane nephropathy in 32 (30.8%), and IgA nephropathy (mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis) in 33 (31.7%). The investigators analyzed the clinical type of nephropathy, performed conventional laboratory and instrumental examinations, and determined the level of CysC (by immunoturbodimetry) and NGAL (by enzyme immunoassay) in the serum and daily urine taken before kidney biopsy. The degree of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstititial sclerosis, and tubular atrophy was semiquantitatively estimated. RESULTS: Urinary CysC and NGAL excretion correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria and the reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) regardless of the method of its determination. The urinary level of NGAL positively correlated with the degree of tubular atrophy. The GFR value determined from serum CysC and creatinine levels more precisely reflected the degree of glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSION: The tubulointerstitial compartment in primary glomerulopathies should be determined not only by morphological changes, but also by tubular function parameters by estimating the urinary excretion of biomarkers. The urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. To estimate the degree of glomerulosclerosis, it is more preferable to use the GFR calculated from the blood concentrations of CysC and creatinine, by keeping in mind clinical findings (using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, 2012).",

Heart valves exhibit a highly-conserved stratified structure exquisitely designed to counter biomechanical forces delivered over a lifetime. Heart valve structure and competence is maintained by heart valve cells through a process of continuous turnover extracellular matrix (ECM). Degenerative (myxomatous) mitral valve disease (DMVD) is an important disease associated with aging in both dogs and humans. DMVD is increasingly regarded as a disease with identifiable signaling mechanisms that control key genes associated with regulation and dysregulation of ECM homeostasis. Initiating stimuli for these signaling pathways have not been fully elucidated but likely include both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Signaling pathways implicated in DMVD include serotonin, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), and heart valve developmental pathways. High circulating serotonin (carcinoid syndrome) and serotoninergic drugs are known to cause valvulopathy that shares pathologic features with DMVD. Recent evidence supports a local serotonin signaling mechanism, possibly triggered by high tensile loading on heart valves. Serotonin initiates TGF\u03b2 signaling, which in turn has been strongly implicated in canine DMVD. Recent evidence suggests that degenerative aortic and mitral valve disease may involve pathologic processes that mimic osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, respectively. These processes may be mediated by developmental pathways shared by heart valves, bone, and cartilage. These pathways include bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling. Other signaling pathways implicated in heart valve disease include Notch, nitric oxide, and angiotensin II. Ultimately, increased understanding of signaling mechanisms could point to therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the hypothesis that chronic low level exposure to organophosphates (OPs) in sheep dips is related to clinically detectable measures of polyneuropathy. METHODS: The design was a cross sectional exposure-response study of sheep dippers and other non-exposed groups. The study group consisted of 612 sheep dipping farmers, 53 farmers with no sheep dipping experience, and 107 ceramics workers. Retrospective exposure information was obtained by questionnaire based on stable and easily identifiable features of sheep dipping found during the first phase of the study; in particular, estimates of handling concentrate and splashing with dilute dip. Neurological assessments were based on a standard neuropathy symptoms questionnaire, and thermal and vibration quantitative sensory tests. RESULTS: Adjusted for confounders there was a weak positive association between cumulative exposure to OPs and neurological symptoms, the significance of which was dependent on the inclusion of a few individual workers with extremely high exposure. There was no evidence of an association between cumulative exposure and the thermal or vibration sensory thresholds. However, separating the effects of exposure intensity and duration showed a higher prevalence of symptoms, primarily of a sensory type, among sheep dippers who handled the OP concentrate. There was also evidence that sensory and vibration thresholds were higher among concentrate handlers, the highest exposed group of dippers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds. There was only weak evidence of a chronic effect of low dose cumulative exposure to OPs. It is suggested that long term health effects may occur in at least some sheep dippers exposed to OPs over a working life, although the mechanisms are unclear.",

CONTEXT: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a cystic lung disease that can be included in the wide group of proliferative lesions named PEComas (perivascular epithelioid cell tumors). These proliferative tumors are characterized by the coexpression of myogenic and melanogenesis-related markers. In all these lesions, genetic alterations related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have been demonstrated. Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway. These data have opened a new era in the comprehension of the pathogenesis of LAM and have also suggested new therapeutic strategies for this potentially lethal disease. OBJECTIVE: To present and discuss the pathologic and molecular features of LAM within the spectrum of PEComas, providing a rational approach to their diagnosis. DATA SOURCES: The published literature and personal experience. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of LAM within the PEComa category is supported by a variety of biologic data and can significantly help in providing a comprehensive view of this interesting and clinically relevant group of lesions. The demonstration of molecular alterations of the mTOR pathway in LAM and other PEComas represents a rational basis for innovative therapeutic approaches with inhibitors of mTOR signaling.",

Mutant KRAS in lung cancers induces molecular pathways that regulate cellular proliferation, survival and inflammation, which enhance tumorigenesis. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) upregulation and sustained nitric oxide generation are induced during the inflammatory response and correlate positively with lung tumorigenesis. To explore the mechanistic contribution of NOS2 to KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis and inflammation, we used a genetic strategy of crossing NOS2 knockout (NOS2KO) C57BL6 inbred mice with a KRAS(G12D)-driven mouse lung cancer model. KRAS(G12D);NOS2KO mice exhibited delayed lung tumorigenesis and a longer overall survival time compared to that of KRAS(G12D);NOS2WT (wild-type) controls. Correspondingly, tumors in KRAS(G12D);NOS2KO mice had reduced tumor cell proliferation in adenomas and carcinomas. NOS2 deficiency also led to markedly suppressed inflammatory response by attenuation of macrophage recruitment into alveoli and within tumor foci. In contrast, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells were increased in tumors from KRAS(G12D) ;NOS2KO mice. We further analyzed the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21), an oncogenic noncoding RNA involved in oncogenic Ras signaling, by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Lung carcinomas dissected from KRAS(G12D);NOS2KO mice showed a significantly reduced miR-21 expression along with decreased tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that NOS2 deficiency could attenuate RAS signaling pathways that transactivate miR-21 expression. Therefore, deletion of NOS2 decreases lung tumor growth as well as inflammatory responses initiated by oncogenic KRAS, suggesting that both KRAS and NOS2 cooperate in driving lung tumorigenesis and inflammation. Inhibition of NOS2 may have a therapeutic value in lung cancers with oncogenic KRAS mutations.",

It is likely, therefore, that they can also modulate sensitivity and resistance to anticancer drugs in substantial ways. To test this hypothesis, we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. In the experimental system, we increased the expression of individual microRNAs by transfecting their precursors (which are active) or suppressed the expression by transfection of antisense oligomers. In three NCI-60 human cancer cell lines, a panel of 60 lines used for anticancer drug discovery, we assessed the growth-inhibitory potencies of 14 structurally diverse compounds with known anticancer activities. Changing the cellular levels of let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21 affected the potencies of a number of the anticancer agents by up to 4-fold. The effect was most prominent with mir-21, with 10 of 28 cell-compound pairs showing significant shifts in growth-inhibitory activity. Varying mir-21 levels changed potencies in opposite directions depending on compound class; indicating that different mechanisms determine toxic and protective effects. In silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Ten of those microRNAs have already been implicated in cancer biology. Our results support a substantial role for microRNAs in anticancer drug response, suggesting novel potential approaches to the improvement of chemotherapy.",

OBJECT: Gliadel (BCNU) wafer and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy, when used individually as adjuvant therapies, extend survival from that achieved by resection and radiation therapy (XRT) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It remains unstudied whether combining Gliadel and TMZ therapy is safe or further improves survival in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The authors reviewed their initial experience utilizing combined Gliadel, TMZ, and radiation therapy for the treatment of GBM. METHODS: All cases involving patients undergoing primary resection of GBM with or without Gliadel wafer (3.85% BCNU) implantation and adjuvant XRT over a 10-year period (1997-2006) were retrospectively reviewed. Beginning in 2004, concomitant TMZ became the standard of care at the authors' institution and all patients with Gliadel implantation also received concomitant TMZ (Stupp protocol). Overall survival and treatment-related morbidity were assessed for all patients treated with Gliadel plus concomitant TMZ (XRT + Gliadel + TMZ). Age-matched (<or= 70 years) comparison of survival and morbidity was performed between the XRT + Gliadel + TMZ (post-2003) and XRT + Gliadel (pre-2004) cohorts. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were treated with XRT + Gliadel + TMZ. The median survival in this group was 20.7 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 36%. Six-month morbidity included surgical site infection in 1 case (3%), perioperative seizures in 2 cases (6%), deep-vein thrombus in 1 (3%), pulmonary embolism in 3 (9%), and cerebral edema requiring admission for intravenous dexamethasone in 1 case (3%). Myelosuppression required premature termination of TMZ in 7 patients (21%) (thrombocytopenia in 5, neutropenia in 2 cases). In patients <or= 70 years of age, XRT + Gliadel + TMZ (30 patients, post-2003) was independently associated with improved median survival (21.3 vs 12.4 months, p = 0.005) versus XRT + Gliadel (78 patients, pre-2004), with 2-year survival of 39 versus 18%, respectively. In these patients, XRT + Gliadel + TMZ was not associated with an increase in perioperative morbidity in comparison with XRT + Gliadel. CONCLUSIONS: In this experience, concomitant TMZ therapy in addition to Gliadel wafer implantation was associated with a median survival of nearly 21 months without increased perioperative morbidity. Temozolomide can be safely administered to patients receiving Gliadel wafers after resection of GBM.",

However, their association has never been studied. On the other hand, DNA methylation is absent in promoters but is enriched in gene bodies. Intragenic nucleosomes and their modifications have been recently associated with RNA splicing. Because the function of intragenic DNA methylation remains unclear, I explored the possibility of its involvement in splicing regulation. RESULTS: Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island. However, the DNA sequences of CpG islands predicted the opposite pattern, implying a limitation of sequence programs for the determination of nucleosome occupancy. In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. Exon-enrichment of DNA methylation was specifically found in spliced exons and in exons with weak splice sites. The enrichment patterns were less pronounced in initial exons and in non-coding exons, potentially reflecting a lower need for their splicing. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels.",

Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) stimulates cAMP signalling and melanin production and enhances DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation. Individuals carrying MC1R variants, especially those associated with red hair colour, fair skin and poor tanning ability (denoted as RHC variants), are associated with higher risk of melanoma. However, how MC1R activity is modulated by ultraviolet irradiation, why individuals with red hair are more prone to developing melanoma, and whether the activity of RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic benefit are unknown. Here we demonstrate a potential MC1R-targeted intervention strategy in mice to rescue loss-of-function MC1R in MC1R RHC variants for therapeutic benefit by activating MC1R protein palmitoylation. MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using C57BL/6J-Mc1rJ mice, in which endogenous MC1R is prematurely terminated, expressing Mc1r RHC variants, we show that pharmacological activation of palmitoylation rescues the defects of Mc1r RHC variants and prevents melanomagenesis.

As a result, HER3 is suggested to serve as an allosteric activator of other EGFR family members which include EGFR, HER2 and HER4. To study the role of intracellular domains in HER3 dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways, we constructed HER3/HER2 chimeric receptors by replacing the HER3 kinase domain (HER3-2-3) or both the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail (HER3-2-2) with the HER2 counterparts and expressed the chimeric receptors in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. While over expression of the intact human HER3 transformed CHO cells with oncogenic properties such as AKT/ERK activation and increased proliferation and migration, CHO cells expressing the HER3-2-3 chimeric receptor showed significantly reduced HER3/HER2 dimerization and decreased phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK1/2 in the presence of neuregulin-1 (NRG-1). In contrast, CHO cells expressing the HER3-2-2 chimeric receptor resulted in a total loss of downstream AKT activation in response to NRG-1, but maintained partial activation of ERK1/2.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), commonly known as \"brittle bone disease\", is a dominant autosomal disorder characterized by bone fragility and abnormalities of connective tissue. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have shown that the vast majority of affected individuals have mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode the chains of type I procollagen. OI is associated with a wide spectrum of phenotypes varying from mild to severe and lethal conditions. The mild forms are usually caused by mutations which inactivate one allele of COL1A1 gene and result in a reduced amount of normal type I collagen, while the severe and lethal forms result from dominant negative mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 which produce structural defects in the collagen molecule. The most common mutations are substitutions of glycine residues, which are crucial to formation and function of the collagen triple helix, by larger amino acids. Although type I collagen is the major structural protein of both bone and skin, the mutations in type I collagen genes cause a bone disease. Some reports showed that the mutant collagen can be expressed differently in bone and in skin. Since most mutations identified in OI are dominant negative, the gene therapy requires a fundamentally different approach from that used for genetic-recessive disorders. The antisense therapy, by reducing the expression of mutant genes, is able to change a structural mutation into a null mutation, and thus convert severe forms of the disease into mild OI type I.",

Macroautophagy (autophagy), associated with bulk cytoplasmic remodeling through lysosomal degradation, has clearly defined roles in cell survival and death. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that proteins, organelles, and pathogens can be targeted for autophagic clearance by selective mechanisms, although the extent and roles of such degradation are unclear. Here we report a conserved role for autophagy specifically in the cortical remodeling of Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) and mouse macrophages. Continuous autophagy was required for integrin-mediated hemocyte spreading and Rho1-induced cell protrusions. Consequently, hemocytes disrupted for autophagy were impaired in their recruitment to epidermal wounds. Cell spreading required ref(2)P, the Drosophila p62 multiadaptor, implicating selective autophagy as a novel mechanism for modulating cortical dynamics.

EZH2 is part of the PRC2 polycomb repressive complex that is overexpressed in multiple cancer types and has been implicated in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Here, we identify EZH2 as a target of the MYC oncogene in prostate cancer and show that MYC coordinately regulates EZH2 through transcriptional and post-transcriptional means. Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN. We report that upregulation of Myc in the mouse prostate results in overexpression of EZH2 mRNA and protein which coincides with reductions in miR-26a and miR-26b, known regulators of EZH2 in some non-prostate cell types, albeit not in others. Further, in human prostate cancer cells, Myc negatively regulates miR-26a and miR-26b via direct binding to their parental Pol II gene promoters, and forced overexpression of miR-26a and miR-26b in prostate cancer cells results in decreased EZH2 levels and suppressed proliferation. In human clinical samples, miR-26a and miR-26b are downregulated in most primary prostate cancers. As a separate mechanism of EZH2 mRNA upregulation, we find that Myc binds directly to and activates the transcription of the EZH2 promoter. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. Further, the results implicate EZH2-driven mechanisms by which Myc may stimulate prostate tumor initiation and disease progression.",

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a neoplasm for which the prevalence and mortality rates are very high in Taiwan. The DNA non-homologous end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents. Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the contribution of variant XRCC6 in relation to the risk of HCC, from the levels of DNA, RNA and protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this hospital-based case-control study, we collected 298 patients with HCC and 298 cancer-free controls, with frequency matched by age and gender. Firstly, the associations of XRCC6 promoter T-991C (rs5751129), promoter G-57C (rs2267437), promoter A-31G (rs132770), and intron-3 (rs132774) polymorphisms with HCC risk in this Taiwanese population were evaluated. Secondly, 30 HCC tissue samples with variant genotypes were tested to estimate the XRCC6 mRNA expression by real-time quantitative reverse transcription. Finally, the HCC tissue samples of variant genotypes were examined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting to estimate their XRCC6 protein expression levels. RESULTS: Compared with the TT genotype, the TC and CC genotypes conferred a significantly increased risk of HCC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.43 and 3.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.52-4.03 and 1.18-13.36, p=0.0003 and 0.0385, respectively]. The mRNA and protein expression levels in HCC tissues revealed statistically significantly lower XRCC6 mRNA and protein expressions in the HCC samples with TC/CC genotypes compared with those with the TT genotype (p=0.0037 and 0.0003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our multi-approach findings at the DNA, RNA and protein levels suggested that XRCC6 may play an important role in HCC carcinogenesis in the Taiwanese population.",

Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. Moreover, the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in melanocytic tumors is not known. We therefore examined 165 benign and malignant melanocytic lesions (including 118 invasive melanomas and 18 metastases collected as consecutive cases from various time periods and from two different pathology departments; the 51 nodular melanomas were randomly selected from a larger, consecutive, population-based series of nodular melanomas) with respect to alterations in the EGFR, BRAF and NRAS genes. Mutations in EGFR (exons 18-21) were not detected. EGFR protein expression was observed in a subgroup of melanomas, but without associations with clinicopathologic phenotype or prognosis. Cytoplasmic EGFR expression was, however, significantly increased from benign nevi to melanomas. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS were detected in superficial melanoma (25 and 29%, respectively), nodular melanoma (29 and 28%, respectively) and lentigo maligna melanoma (15 and 16%, respectively). In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors.",

Fifteen percent of lung cancer cases occur in never-smokers and show characteristics that are molecularly and clinically distinct from those in smokers. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, which are correlated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), are more frequent in never-smoker lung cancers. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 28 cases of never-smoker lung cancer identified aberrantly expressed miRNAs, which were much fewer than in lung cancers of smokers and included miRNAs previously identified (e.g., up-regulated miR-21) and unidentified (e.g., down-regulated miR-138) in those smoker cases. The changes in expression of some of these miRNAs, including miR-21, were more remarkable in cases with EGFR mutations than in those without these mutations. A significant correlation between phosphorylated-EGFR (p-EGFR) and miR-21 levels in lung carcinoma cell lines and the suppression of miR-21 by an EGFR-TKI, AG1478, suggest that the EGFR signaling is a pathway positively regulating miR-21 expression. In the never-smoker-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell line H3255 with mutant EGFR and high levels of p-EGFR and miR-21, antisense inhibition of miR-21 enhanced AG1478-induced apoptosis. In a never-smoker-derived adenocarcinoma cell line H441 with wild-type EGFR, the antisense miR-21 not only showed the additive effect with AG1478 but also induced apoptosis by itself. These results suggest that aberrantly increased expression of miR-21, which is enhanced further by the activated EGFR signaling pathway, plays a significant role in lung carcinogenesis in never-smokers, as well as in smokers, and is a potential therapeutic target in both EGFR-mutant and wild-type cases.",

Diagnosis requires clinical documentation of one or more of the characteristic symptoms of INPH in combination with a brain imaging study demonstrating nonobstructive ventricular enlargement disproportionate to cerebral atrophy. Gait and balance disturbances are the most common presenting findings in INPH and may occur alone or together with cognitive and urinary symptoms. Adjunct tests, particularly those involving transient removal of cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar puncture or lumbar drain, can serve the dual purpose of adding to diagnostic certainty and assisting in prognostication about response to treatment. Prognostication is important because neurosurgical treatment by placement of a ventricular shunt, while effective, carries the risk of potentially significant morbidity.

In recent years, iTRAQ has been one of the main methods of choice for high throughput quantitative proteomics analysis, which enables simultaneous comparison of up to eight samples in one experiment. Our objective was to assess the relative merits of iTRAQ analysis of fresh frozen versus FFPE nervous tissues by comparing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced proteomic changes in FFPE rat spinal cords and frozen tissues. EAE-induced proteomic changes in FFPE tissues were positively correlated with those found in the frozen tissues, albeit with \u223c50% less proteome coverage. Subsequent validation of the enrichment of immunoproteasome (IP) activator 1 in EAE spinal cords led us to evaluate other proteasome and IP-specific proteins. We discovered that many IP-specific (as opposed to constitutive) proteasomal proteins were enriched in EAE rat spinal cords, and EAE-induced IP accumulation also occurred in the spinal cords of an independent mouse EAE model in a disability score-dependent manner. Therefore, we conclude that it is feasible to generate useful information from iTRAQ-based neuroproteomics analysis of archived FFPE tissues for studying neurological disease tissues.",

Groups of 30 male Wistar rats were administered drug intravenously at doses of 0, 0.25, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. This cycle of dosing and recovery was repeated six times to simulate human clinical usage of the drug. Assessments of hematology, clinical chemistry, and gross and microscopic pathology were conducted 3 and 21 days following completion of dosing in the first, third, and sixth cycles. There were no deaths during the study. Hair loss, diarrhea, tail injuries, chromodacryorrhea, and rhinorrhea were observed primarily in animals administered 3 mg/kg. Hair loss and diarrhea occurred during periods of dosing and generally resolved during the recovery phase of each cycle. Both of these signs became progressively more severe during the latter half of the study. Body weight loss and reduced food consumption also occurred in the 3 mg/kg group during each week of dosing. At study termination, mean body weight and food consumption of the 3 mg/kg group were significantly less than those of controls by approximately 20 and 50%, respectively. Marked, reversible leukopenia associated with reductions in both neutrophil and lymphocyte counts occurred in cycles one and three in animals administered 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. Reversible neutropenia was also observed in the 3 mg/kg group in cycle 6. Similar effects on platelet counts were seen in the 3 mg/kg group in all three cycles analyzed. Absolute and relative testes weights of the 3 mg/kg group were significantly less than the vehicle controls at all time points in the third and sixth cycles. Relative testes weights were also decreased in the 1 mg/kg group in cycle 6. Reversible decreases in absolute relative spleen weights occurred in all drug-treated groups in cycle 1 and for the 3 mg/kg group in cycle 3. Lymphoid depletion (spleen, thymus, lymph node), marked hypocellularity of bone marrow, segmental degeneration of seminiferous tubules, and intestinal epithelial cell degeneration were observed at 3 mg/kg. With the exception of testicular changes which remained evident at the end of cycle 6, pathologic lesions were reversible during the 23-day recovery period of each cycle. The results show that the subchronic toxicity of amsacrine is consistent with a cytotoxic mechanism and that target organs are generally tissues with the highest rates of cell turnover. The doses administered in this study induced a range of effects which were minimal at 0.25 mg/kg and dose-limiting at 3 mg/kg and therefore were considered appropriate for use in the subsequent carcinogenicity bioassay.",

BACKGROUND: The survival of endometriotic cells in the ectopic site has been investigated from the aspect of susceptibility of endometriotic tissues to apoptosis. In order to investigate the nature of abnormal survival of endometriotic cells in ectopic locations, we compared drug-induced apoptosis in endometrial and endometriotic cells. METHODS: Endometrial stromal cells were obtained from normal endometrium in 11 patients who underwent hysterectomy for leiomyoma without endometriosis. Endometriotic cells were isolated from the chocolate cyst linings of the ovary in 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of staurosporine. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by staining nuclei with propidium iodide and phosphatidylserine (a marker of early apoptotic events) with Annexin V as well as by DNA fragmentation assay. The number of viable cells was estimated by modified MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide WST-8] assay. RESULTS: After 3 h of exposure to staurosporine, >50% of the endometrial stromal cells became Annexin V positive. In contrast, >30% of the endometriotic cells were Annexin V positive. DNA fragmentation was not clearly induced in the endometriotic cells. Less than 20% of the endometrial cells survived after staurosporine exposure, while >40% of the endometriotic cells survived. Cell death induced by staurosporine was partially blocked by incubation with the caspase inhibitor, N-benzyoxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl-ketone (ZVAD-fmk), suggesting that a caspase cascade may play a role in the cell death process.

CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers. Within an animal group CNEs are the most conserved sequences but between groups they are normally diverged beyond recognition. Alternative CNEs are, however, associated with an overlapping set of genes that control development in all animals. Here, we discuss the evidence that CNEs are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The major animal groups arose >550 million years ago. We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the \"re-wiring\" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.",

A 47-year-old Japanese woman developed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) complicated by a rare combination of aortitis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Despite the therapy with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, the aortitis was not ameliorated. However, after cyclophosphamide was replaced with intravenous tocilizumab, the aortitis was improved, and the prednisolone dose was successfully tapered to 4 mg/day without elevation in C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA) levels. Several studies have reported that tocilizumab is effective for aortitis associated with Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arteritis. On the other hand, we succeeded to improve the aortitis in AAV with monthly administration of tocilizumab. Moreover, we successfully controlled disease activity and enabled the tapering of prednisolone to 4 mg/day without relapses of AAV symptoms and elevated MPO-ANCA levels. It indicates that tocilizumab may be therapeutically beneficial for not only aortitis but also AAV itself.

BACKGROUND: The soil-dwelling saprophyte bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the cause of melioidosis, a severe disease of humans and animals in southeast Asia and northern Australia. Despite the detection of B. pseudomallei in various soil and water samples from endemic areas, the environmental habitat of B. pseudomallei remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a large survey in the Darwin area in tropical Australia and screened 809 soil samples for the presence of these bacteria. B. pseudomallei were detected by using a recently developed and validated protocol involving soil DNA extraction and real-time PCR targeting the B. pseudomallei-specific Type III Secretion System TTS1 gene cluster. Statistical analyses such as multivariable cluster logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to assess the association of B. pseudomallei with environmental factors. The combination of factors describing the habitat of B. pseudomallei differed between undisturbed sites and environmentally manipulated areas. At undisturbed sites, the occurrence of B. pseudomallei was found to be significantly associated with areas rich in grasses, whereas at environmentally disturbed sites, B. pseudomallei was associated with the presence of livestock animals, lower soil pH and different combinations of soil texture and colour. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to the elucidation of environmental factors influencing the occurrence of B. pseudomallei and raises concerns that B. pseudomallei may spread due to changes in land use.",

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is critical for embryonic development. In adult tissues, Hh signaling is relatively quiescent with the exception of roles in tissue maintenance and repair. Aberrant activation of Hh signaling is implicated in multiple aspects of transformation, including the maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Preclinical studies indicate that CSCs from many tumor types are sensitive to Hh pathway inhibition and that Hh-targeted therapeutics block many aspects of transformation attributed to CSCs, including drug resistance, relapse, and metastasis. However, to date, Hh inhibitors, specifically those targeting Smoothened [such as vismodegib, BMS-833923, saridegib (IPI-926), sonidegib/erismodegib (LDE225), PF-04449913, LY2940680, LEQ 506, and TAK-441], have demonstrated good efficacy as monotherapy in patients with basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but have shown limited activity in other tumor types. This lack of success is likely due to many factors, including a lack of patient stratification in early trials, cross-talk between Hh and other oncogenic signaling pathways that can modulate therapeutic response, and a limited knowledge of Hh pathway activation mechanisms in CSCs from most tumor types. Here, we discuss Hh signaling mechanisms in the context of human cancer, particularly in the maintenance of the CSC phenotype, and consider new therapeutic strategies that hold the potential to expand considerably the scope and therapeutic efficacy of Hh-directed anticancer therapy.",

There is epidemiologic evidence that individuals with Down syndrome are at decreased risk for solid tumors including brain tumors. It has been suggested that some genes expressed on the extra copy of chromosome 21 act as tumor suppressor genes and contribute to protection against tumorigenesis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with Down syndrome, an 8-year-old boy, with an intracranial meningioma, in which the status of chromosome 21 was examined. The diagnosis was based on histologic examination of the surgically resected tumor. Postoperatively, the patient's neurologic status improved, and there was no tumor regrowth in the next 2 years. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosome 22 confirmed high allele loss involving the neurofibromin 2 gene locus, a finding typical in meningiomas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization also revealed chromosome 21 heterogeneity in tumor cells; not only cells with trisomy 21 but also cells with disomy and monosomy 21 were present. All blood cells from the patient manifested trisomy 21. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of the chromosome 21 allele may be associated with tumorigenesis of meningioma in Down syndrome. This supports the hypothesis that some genes whose expression is increased on the extra copy of chromosome 21 function as tumor suppressor genes and that they contribute to the reduced tumor incidence in individuals with Down syndrome.",

Cytokines and stress-inducing stimuli signal through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) using a diverse and only partially defined set of downstream effectors.

JNK phosphorylated DCP1a at residue S315 in vivo and in vitro and coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with DCP1a in processing bodies (P bodies). Sustained JNK activation by several different inducers led to DCP1a dispersion from P bodies, whereas IL-1 treatment transiently increased P body number. Inhibition of TAK1-JNK signaling also affected the number and size of P bodies and the localization of DCP1a, Xrn1, and Edc4. Transcriptome analysis further identified a central role for DCP1a in IL-1-induced messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression. Phosphomimetic mutation of S315 stabilized IL-8 but not I\u03baB\u03b1 mRNA, whereas overexpressed DCP1a blocked IL-8 transcription and suppressed p65 NF-\u03baB nuclear activity. Collectively, these data reveal DCP1a as a multifunctional regulator of mRNA expression and suggest a novel mechanism controlling the subcellular localization of DCP1a in response to stress or inflammatory stimuli.",

PURPOSE: The dismal outcome of esophageal cancer patients highlights the need for novel prognostic biomarkers, such as microRNAs (miRNA). Although recent studies have established the role of miRNAs in esophageal carcinoma, a comprehensive multicenter study investigating different histologic types, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma with or without Barrett's, is still lacking. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: miRNA expression was measured in cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissue pairs collected from 100 adenocarcinoma and 70 SCC patients enrolled at four clinical centers from the United States, Canada, and Japan. Microarray-based expression was measured in a subset of samples in two cohorts and was validated in all available samples. RESULTS: In adenocarcinoma patients, miR-21, miR-223, miR-192, and miR-194 expression was elevated, whereas miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. In SCC patients, we found elevated miR-21 and reduced miR-375 expression levels in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. When comparing cancerous tissue expression between adenocarcinoma and SCC patients, miR-194 and miR-375 were elevated in adenocarcinoma patients. Significantly, elevated miR-21 expression in noncancerous tissue of SCC patients and reduced levels of miR-375 in cancerous tissue of adenocarcinoma patients with Barrett's were strongly associated with worse prognosis. Associations with prognosis were independent of tumor stage or nodal status, cohort type, and chemoradiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our multicenter-based results highlight miRNAs involved in major histologic types of esophageal carcinoma and uncover significant associations with prognosis. Elucidating miRNAs relevant to esophageal carcinogenesis is potentially clinically useful for developing prognostic biomarkers and identifying novel drug targets and therapies.",

BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). In marmoset monkeys, flibanserin has demonstrated pro-social effects on male-female pairmates, while the classic 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT suppresses female sexual behavior and increases aggressive interactions between pairmates. Activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors is known to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This study aims to characterize the effects of repeated flibanserin and 8-OH-DPAT administration on the marmoset HPA axis and to elucidate endocrine correlates of altered marmoset pair behavior. METHODS: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were examined at baseline and during 5-HT(1A) agonist and restraint challenges in 8 female marmoset monkeys receiving daily flibanserin (15mg/kg) and an additional 8 female marmosets receiving 8-OH-DPAT (0.1mg/kg) for 15-16weeks. Corresponding vehicle treatments were administered in a counterbalanced, within-subject design. All females were housed in stable male-female pairs. Treatment-induced changes in ACTH and cortisol levels were correlated with previously assessed marmoset pair behavior. RESULTS: While morning basal cortisol levels and HPA responses to a 5-HT(1A) agonist challenge were not altered by chronic flibanserin or 8-OH-DPAT, both treatments increased the responsiveness of the marmoset HPA axis to restraint. Enhanced ACTH responses to restraint correlated with reduced sexual receptivity and increased aggression in 8-OH-DPAT-, but not in flibanserin-treated female marmosets. CONCLUSIONS: Unaltered HPA responses to a 5-HT(1A) agonist challenge after chronic flibanserin and 8-OH-DPAT treatments indicate little or no de-sensitization of the HPA axis to repeated 5-HT(1A) manipulation. Chronic 8-OH-DPAT, but not flibanserin, leads to aggravated ACTH responses to stress that may contribute to anti-sexual and anti-social behavior between 8-OH-DPAT-treated females and their male pairmates. Despite similar flibanserin and 8-OH-DPAT induced ACTH responses to restraint stress, flibanserin-treated females show unchanged cortisol profiles. This is possibly due to flibanserin's regional selectivity in 5-HT(1A) activation and concurrent 5-HT(2A) inhibition. The contrasting restraint-related cortisol responses emulate contrasting behavioral phenotypes of diminished pair-bond of 8-OH-DPAT-treated females compared to the more affiliative pair-bond of flibanserin-treated females.",

The recent feasibility of genome-wide studies of adaptation in human populations has provided novel insights into biological pathways that have been affected by adaptive pressures.

Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis for evidence of recent positive selection in a sample of 120 individuals of Wolaita ethnicity belonging to Omotic-speaking people who have inhabited the mid- and high-land areas of southern Ethiopia for millennia. Using the 11 HapMap populations as the comparison group, we found Wolaita-specific signals of recent positive selection in several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci. Notably, the selected loci overlapped with HLA regions that we previously reported to be associated with podoconiosis-a geochemical lymphedema of the lower legs common in the Wolaita area. We found selection signals in PPARA, a gene involved in energy metabolism during prolonged food deficiency. This finding is consistent with the dietary use of enset, a crop with high-carbohydrate and low-fat and -protein contents domesticated in Ethiopia subsequent to food deprivation 10 000 years ago, and with metabolic adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia.

He was admitted with a two-year history of fear, auditory hallucination, learning difficulty, sleeping problems, irascibility, drowsing and giggling. At admission, he had significantly elevated plasma and urine levels of total homocysteine, significantly decreased levels of folate in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and a normal blood concentration of methionine.

The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar. We find different and specific patterns of DNA methylation in each of the GC architectures; yet in both groups, DNA methylation clearly marks the exons. Exons of the leveled GC architecture exhibit a significantly stronger DNA methylation signal in relation to their flanking introns compared to exons of the differential GC architecture. This is accentuated by a reduction of the DNA methylation level in the intronic sequences in proximity to the splice sites and shows that different epigenetic modifications mark the location of exons already at the DNA level. Also, lower levels of methylated CpGs on alternative exons can successfully distinguish alternative exons from constitutive ones. Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture.

The sites of polyadenylation of bacterial mRNA are diverse and include the 3'-ends of primary transcripts, the sites of endonucleolytic processing in the 3' untranslated and intercistronic regions, and sites within the coding regions of mRNA degradation products. The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. Two poly(A) polymerases have been identified in Escherichia coli. They are encoded by unlinked genes, neither of which is essential for growth, suggesting significant functional overlap. Polyadenylation promotes the degradation of a regulatory RNA that inhibits the replication of bacterial plasmids and may play a similar role in the degradation of mRNA. However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. Their ability to bind S1 ribosomal protein suggests that poly(A) tracts may also play a role in mRNA translation.",

AIMS: This study aimed to identify the different expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the placental tissues of pregnant women with preeclampsia (PE) and to provide a new avenue of research regarding the pathological mechanisms of PE. METHODS: In this study, we collected 40 placental tissues from PE patients and 35 placental tissues from gestational age-matched patients who gave premature birth. Arraystar circRNA Microarray Technology (KANGCHEN, Shanghai, China) was used to analyze the differential expression of circRNAs. According to the basic content of circRNAs in the two groups and their fold changes and due to the practicability of the designed divergent primers of each candidate circRNA, we selected three up-regulated circRNAs, hsa_circRNA_100782, hsa_circRNA_102682 and hsa_circRNA_104820, to validate the data. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to estimate the Ct values in both groups. We further evaluated the differences with a paired t-test and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Many circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in PE placental tissues versus their controls; of these, 143 circRNAs were up-regulated and 158 were down-regulated. The expression levels of hsa_circRNA_100782 (p < 0.05), hsa_circRNA_102682 (p < 0.05), and hsa_circRNA_104820 (p < 0.0001) were validated as significantly up-regulated in the experimental group compared with the controls. Finally, we performed a literature comparison to forecast the possible mechanisms of circRNA function during PE. CONCLUSION: circRNA expression significantly differed in placental PE tissues compared with controls. According to the circRNA microarray results and the existing papers, circRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of PE by acting as miRNA sponges; this possibility requires additional investigation in future studies.",

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Routine screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) or portal vein thrombosis (PVT) has been recommended in Western countries. However, little is known about whether the routine screening test should be necessary in Chinese patients with BCS or PVT. We conducted a prospective observational study to examine the prevalence of PNH in these patients. METHODS: Patients with primary BCS or non-malignant PVT who were consecutively admitted to our department or regularly followed up between September 2009 and December 2011 were eligible for the study and detected the expression of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes and granulocytes. The CD55 or CD59 deficiency was considered as the proportion of erythrocytes or granulocytes with normal expression of CD55 or CD59 was less than 90%. PNH was diagnosed by both CD55 and CD59 deficient clone at flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells. RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Only one patient had both CD55 and CD59 deficiencies on granulocytes. But he had been diagnosed with PNH before BCS. CONCLUSIONS: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was very rare in Chinese patients with BCS or PVT, suggesting that routine screening for PNH should not be indiscriminately performed in such patients.",

BACKGROUND: We recently reported that long-term cyclosporine (CsA)-induced oxidative stress is associated with decreased expression of klotho, an anti-aging gene. This study evaluated whether the antioxidant effect of statin might upregulate klotho expression in CsA-induced renal injury. METHODS: Two separate experiments were performed. First, the dose-dependent effect of statin on klotho expression was evaluated in normal mouse kidneys. Second, the effect of statin on klotho expression was evaluated in experimental chronic CsA nephropathy in mice. We performed immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for klotho, Forkhead box O transcription factors [FoxOs; phosphorylated FoxO1 (p-FoxO1) and FoxO3a (p-FoxO3a)] and their target molecules, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), Bim and hemeoxygenase-1. RESULTS: Statin treatment upregulated klotho expression in a dose-dependent manner in the normal mouse kidney and alleviated the decrease in klotho expression in kidneys exhibiting CsA nephropathy. CsA administration increased p-FoxO1 expression and decreased p-FoxO3a expression, whereas concurrent statin treatment reversed these changes, increased the expression of the antioxidant enzymes MnSOD and hemeoxygenase-1 and decreased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell apoptosis is the initiating factor of cardiac complications especially diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondria are susceptible to the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause cardiac dysfunction. Here, we examined the effect of high-glucose induced calcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac apoptosis in an in vitro setting. METHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated glucose condition and the cellular consequences were studied. Intracellular calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and caspase-9 pathway were studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. Concomitant intra-mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation. These events led to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Cardiomyocyte death exhibited several classical markers of apoptosis, including activation of caspases, appearance of annexin V on the outer plasma membrane, increased population of cells with sub-G0/G1 DNA content and nuclear condensation. Key findings include elucidation of cell signaling mechanism of high-glucose induced calcium-dependent cysteine protease calpain-1 activation, which triggers non-conventional caspases as alternate mode of cell death. CONCLUSION: This information increases the understanding of cardiac cell death under hyperglycemic condition and can possibly be extended for designing new therapeutic strategies for diabetic cardiomyopathy. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The novel findings of the study reveal that high glucose induces apoptosis by both mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways via concomitant rise in intracellular calcium.",

The development of prostate cancer and the progression from a normal prostate epithelium to androgen-dependent cancer and eventually to hormone-refractory prostate cancer is a multistep process involving several changes in the function of different growth-regulatory signals. In the past 10 years, conflicting results on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family expression in prostate cancer have been reported. These differences may result from technical differences, lack of standardization of immunohistochemical assays, or different scoring methodologies. Recently, 4 studies have shown experimental evidence of a role of the EGFR family, particularly ErbB-2, in the development of prostate cancer and, more specifically, in the progression to hormone-refractory clinical behavior. These 4 studies were similar in some relevant aspects, such as the patient population. In fact, the patients in each study were divided into 3 groups that represent the progression of prostate cancer. In 3 of 4 studies, a statistically significant increase in ErbB-2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in the progression from hormone-dependent to hormone-independent disease. The expression of EGFR was also evaluated in 1 of the 4 studies. In a recent report from our group, a significant increase in EGFR expression was observed in patients treated with radical surgery, in patients who received hormonal therapy as primary therapy before radical prostatectomy, and, finally, in patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory disease. It has been proposed that EGFR family receptors and androgen receptors function synergistically in the absence of androgen suggesting cross-talk between the ErbB-2 and androgen receptor pathways, and that mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase can be considered the transduction pathways. Finally, clinical trials are currently in progress in patients with prostate cancer testing novel agents that selectively interfere with these receptors, such as trastuzumab, an anti- ErbB-2 monoclonal antibody, and gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa), a small-molecule selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.",

Here, we find that maturation of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) pRNA is required for establishment of heterochromatin at ribosomal RNA genes, the genetic component of nucleoli, and this process is inactivated in pluripotent ESCs. By using mature pRNA to tether heterochromatin at nucleoli of ESCs, we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus. Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency. Our findings unravel the nucleolus as an active regulator of chromatin plasticity and pluripotency and challenge current views on heterochromatin regulation and function in ESCs.",

We complement existing theory for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1]. We show that genetic diversity patterns under selective sweeps with strength s and dominance 0 < h < 1 are similar to co-dominant sweeps with selection strength 2hs. Moreover, we focus on the case h=0 of a completely recessive beneficial allele. We find that the length of the sweep, i.e. the time from occurrence until fixation of the beneficial allele, is of the order of \u221a(N/s) generations, if N is the population size.

TGF-\u03b2 signalling is regulated by post-translational modifications of Smad proteins to translate quantitative difference in ligand concentration into proportional transcriptional output. Previous studies in cell culture systems suggested that Smad ubiquitination regulatory factors (Smurfs) act in this regulation by targeting Smads for proteasomal degradation, but whether this mechanism operates under physiological conditions is not clear. Here, we generated mice harbouring a target-disrupted Smurf2 allele. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and dermal fibroblasts, we show that TGF-\u03b2-mediated, Smad-dependent transcriptional responses are elevated in the absence of Smurf2. Instead of promoting poly-ubiquitination and degradation, we show that Smurf2 actually induces multiple mono-ubiquitination of Smad3 in vivo. Phosphorylation of T179, immediately upstream of the Smad3 PY motif, enhances Smurf2 and Smad3 interaction and Smad3 ubiquitination. We have mapped Smurf2-induced Smad3 ubiquitination sites to lysine residues at the MH2 domain, and demonstrate that Smad3 ubiquitination inhibits the formation of Smad3 complexes. Thus, our data support a model in which Smurf2 negatively regulates TGF-\u03b2 signalling by attenuating the activity of Smad3 rather than promoting its degradation.",

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that low thyroid hormones levels may be associated with increased mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic role of thyroid function deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS: We evaluated 338 consecutive outpatients with stable CHF receiving conventional therapy, all of whom underwent a physical examination, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Blood samples were drawn to assess renal function, and Na+, hemoglobin, NT-proBNPs, fT3, fT4 and TSH levels. Patients with hyperthyroidism were excluded. RESULTS: During the follow-up (15+/-8 months), heart failure progression was observed in 79 patients (including 18 who died of heart failure after hospitalisation and six who underwent transplantation). Univariate regression analysis showed that TSH (p<0.0001), fT3 (p<0.0001), fT4 (p=0.016) and fT3/fT4 (p<0.0001) were associated with heart failure progression but multivariate analysis showed that only TSH considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.001) as well as subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH &gt 5.5 mUI/l; p=0.014) remained significantly associated with the events. CONCLUSIONS: In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression.

T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC. Here, we performed 2 complementary screens to identify FDA-approved drugs and drug-like small molecules with activity against T-ALL. We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward MYC-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-ALL cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-ALL cells. Using ligand-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a perphenazine target. T-ALL cell lines treated with perphenazine exhibited rapid dephosphorylation of multiple PP2A substrates and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, shRNA knockdown of specific PP2A subunits attenuated perphenazine activity, indicating that PP2A mediates the drug's antileukemic activity. Finally, human T-ALLs treated with perphenazine exhibited suppressed cell growth and dephosphorylation of PP2A targets in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the recurring identification of phenothiazines as a class of drugs with anticancer effects. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic PP2A activation in T-ALL and other cancers driven by hyperphosphorylated PP2A substrates has therapeutic potential.",

PURPOSE: There are a number of craniosynostosis syndromes with hearing loss-including Muenke, Apert, Pfeiffer, Crouzon, Beare-Stevenson, Crouzon with acanthosis nigricans, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes-that result from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes. Studies of FGFRs and their ligands, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), have revealed clues to the precise contribution of aberrant FGFR signaling to inner ear morphogenesis and the hearing loss encountered in craniosynostoses. The purpose of this article is to review basic studies of FGFRs with emphasis on their function and expression in the inner ear and surrounding structures. METHOD: A Medline search was performed to find basic science articles regarding FGFR, their ligands, and their expression and relevant mouse models. Additional items searched included clinical descriptions and studies of individuals with FGFR-related craniosynostosis syndromes. RESULTS: The FGF signaling pathway is essential for the morphogensis and proper function of the inner ear and auditory sensory epithelium. CONCLUSION: The variable auditory phenotypes seen in individuals with Muenke syndrome may have a genetic basis, likely due to multiple interacting factors in the genetic environment or modifying factors. Further analysis and studies of mouse models of Muenke syndrome, in particular, may provide clues to the specific effects of the defining mutation in FGFR3 in the inner ear not only at birth but also into adulthood. In particular, investigations into these models may give insight into the variable expression and incomplete penetrance of this phenotype.",

The type I receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are involved in various aspects of cell growth, survival, and differentiation. Among the known RTKs, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2 (HER-2) are two widely studied proteins that are prototypic members of the ErbB family which also includes ErbB-3 (Her-3) and ErbB-4 (Her-4). Overexpression of ErbB-2 and EGFR has been associated with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis in a range of human tumour types (e.g. breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, and squamous carcinoma of head and neck). Disruption of signal transduction of these kinases has been shown to have an antiproliferative effect. Various approaches have been developed to target the ErbB signalling pathways including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab/Herceptin\u2122 and cetuximab/Erbitux\u2122) directed against the receptor, and synthetic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib/Iressa\u2122 and erlotinib/Tarceva\u2122). Since many tumours overexpress ErbB receptors, simultaneous targeting of multiple ErbB receptors therefore becomes a promising approach to cancer treatment. Lapatinib (Tykerb\u2122), a potent dual EGFR/ErbB-2 inhibitor, was approved for the treatment of ErbB-2-positive breast cancer. Despite years of intensive research on EGFR inhibitors, there is a surprising dearth of chemically distinct small inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity. There is also a need for new scaffolds due to the recent finding of EGFR mutations which render the kinase resistant to gefinitib and erlotinib. The structures under study will be quinazolines with different substituents. The structure-activity relationships and biological evaluation of compounds published during the last four years will be reviewed herein.",

Sedative-analgesic treatment of patients on long-term artificial ventilation aims at protection from stress related to their disease or therapy. By stabilising both the patient's vital functions and psychological state this treatment may contribute to therapeutic success. The choice of drugs depends primarily on the nature and course of the underlying disease. Midazolam and propofol are available as hypnotics for short-term sedation during the post-operative period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of both agents on cardiovascular function, cortisol production, lipometabolism, and the recovery period following 24-h sedation. METHODS. Twenty female patients (mean body weight: 72 kg, mean age: 60 years) were randomly assigned to receive either midazolam or propofol over 24 h following major abdominal surgery. Balanced anaesthesia (halothane/O2/N2O/fentanyl) was administered for the surgical procedure. Assisted ventilation was used in all patients during the post-operative sedation period. Sedation depth was maintained at III-IV on the Ramsey scale. On arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU), an initial i.v. bolus of midazolam 0.1 mg/kg or propofol 1 mg/kg was followed by a continuous infusion (midazolam: 0.1 mg/kg.h; propofol: 2 mg/kg.h). Supplementary boluses of one-half the initial dose were given if required. Post-operative analgesia was achieved with 3 mg intravenous piritramide at 2-h intervals. A 7F Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted in the pulmonary artery and haemodynamic and biochemical parameters were monitored at 4-h intervals over 24 h starting 2 h after arrival in the ICU. Catecholamines were measured by high-pressure lipid chromatography (HPLC), cortisol by radioimmunoassay, midazolam by HPLC and ultraviolet detection, and propofol by HPLC and fluorescence detection. Data were calculated as means. The statistical analysis was performed according to the Mann-Whitney test, and significance was accepted for P less than 0.05. RESULTS. On administration of the propofol bolus at the onset of sedation, a decrease in blood pressure was particularly observed in patients with masked hypovolaemia, however, this decrease was easily controlled by volume administration. Independent of the type of sedation, the haemodynamic parameters remained unchanged throughout the observation period. At all times of measurement the mean heart rate was lower in the propofol group (90/min) when compared with the midazolam group (100/min), however, this difference did not reach significance. There were also no significant differences in cardiac index at all times of measurement, although it increased in both groups within the first 12 h by 0.6 l/min.min2. In both groups this increase was associated with a reduction in peripheral resistance and an increase in rectal temperature. To achieve the desired sedation depth, midazolam was administered at a mean dosage of 0.11 mg/kg.h and propofol at 1.9 mg/kg.h. Catecholamine levels decreased in both groups within the first 8 h: after 8 h of sedation the plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline were 525 and 65 pg/ml, respectively, in the midazolam group and 327 and 51 pg/ml in the propofol group.

We used maize and rice, maximally diverged members of the grass family of monocots. Using a local sequence alignment set to deliver only significant alignments, we found one or more CNSs in the noncoding regions of the majority of genes studied. Grass genes have dramatically fewer and much smaller CNSs than mammalian genes. Twenty-seven percent of grass gene comparisons revealed no CNSs. Genes functioning in upstream regulatory roles, such as transcription factors, are greatly enriched for CNSs relative to genes encoding enzymes or structural proteins. Further, we show that a CNS cluster in an intron of the knotted1 homeobox gene serves as a site of negative regulation. We showthat CNSs in the adh1 gene do not correlate with known cis-acting sites. We discuss the potential meanings of CNSs and their value as analytical tools and evolutionary characters. We advance the idea that many CNSs function to lock-in gene regulatory decisions.",

Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation. We previously reported significant differences in contractility, SR Ca(2+) release, and CaM kinase II activity in gastric fundus smooth muscles as a result of PLB phosphorylation by CaM kinase II. In this study, we used PLB-knockout (PLB-KO) mice to directly examine the effect of PLB absence on contractility, CaM kinase II activity, and intracellular Ca(2+) waves in gastric antrum smooth muscles. The frequencies and amplitudes of spontaneous phasic contractions were elevated in antrum smooth muscle strips from PLB-KO mice. Bethanecol increased the amplitudes of phasic contractions in antrum smooth muscles from both control and PLB-KO mice. Caffeine decreased and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) increased the basal tone of antrum smooth muscle strips from PLB-KO mice, but the effects were less pronounced compared with control strips. The CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 was less effective at inhibiting caffeine-induced relaxation in antrum smooth muscle strips from PLB-KO mice. CaM kinase II autonomous activity was elevated, and not further increased by caffeine, in antrum smooth muscles from PLB-KO mice. Similarly, the intracellular Ca(2+) wave frequency was elevated, and not further increased by caffeine, in antrum smooth muscles from PLB-KO mice. These findings suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity.",

BACKGROUND: FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. They are collectively referred to as immunophilin (IMM), being present in almost all cellular organs. In particular, a number of IMMs relate to environmental stresses. RESULTS: FKBP and CYP proteins in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Japonica) were identified and classified, and given the appropriate name for each IMM, considering the ortholog-relation with Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas or molecular weight of the proteins. 29 FKBP and 27 CYP genes can putatively be identified in rice; among them, a number of genes can be putatively classified as orthologs of Arabidopsis IMMs. However, some genes were novel, did not match with those of Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, and several genes were paralogs by genetic duplication. Among 56 IMMs in rice, a significant number are regulated by salt and/or desiccation stress. In addition, their expression levels responding to the water-stress have been analyzed in different tissues, and some subcellular IMMs located by means of tagging with GFP protein. CONCLUSION: Like other green photosynthetic organisms such as Arabidopsis (23 FKBPs and 29 CYPs) and Chlamydomonas (23 FKBs and 26 CYNs), rice has the highest number of IMM genes among organisms reported so far, suggesting that the numbers relate closely to photosynthesis. Classification of the putative FKBPs and CYPs in rice provides the information about their evolutional/functional significance when comparisons are drawn with the relatively well studied genera, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. In addition, many of the genes upregulated by water stress offer the possibility of manipulating the stress responses in rice.",

TNNI3K is a new cardiac-specific MAP kinase whose gene is localized to 1p31.1 and that belongs to a tyrosine kinase-like branch in the kinase tree of the human genome. In the present study we investigated the role of TNNI3K in the cardiac myogenesis process and in the repair of ischemic injury. Pluripotent P19CL6 cells with or without transfection by pcDNA6-TNNI3K plasmid were used to induce differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes. TNNI3K promoted the differentiation process, judging from the increasing beating mass and increased number of alpha-actinin-positive cells. TNNI3K improved cardiac function by enhancing beating frequency and increasing the contractile force and epinephrine response of spontaneous action potentials without an increase of the single-cell size. TNNI3K suppressed phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I, annexin-V(+) cells, Bax protein, and p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Intramyocardial administration of TNNI3K-overexpressing P19CL6 cells in mice with myocardial infarction improved cardiac performance and attenuated ventricular remodeling compared with injection of wild-type P19CL6 cells. In conclusion, our study clearly indicates that TNNI3K promotes cardiomyogenesis, enhances cardiac performance, and protects the myocardium from ischemic injury by suppressing p38/JNK-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, modulation of TNNI3K activity would be a useful therapeutic approach for ischemic cardiac disease.",

INTRODUCTION: Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have become standard treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). AIM: To prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of avanafil, a novel PDE5 inhibitor, in men with mild to severe ED. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 trial, 646 subjects were randomized to receive avanafil (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg) or placebo throughout a 12-week treatment period. Subjects were instructed to take study drug 30 minutes prior to initiation of sexual activity. At least a 12-hour separation time between doses was required; no restrictions were placed on food or alcohol intake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvement in erectile function (EF) was measured by Sexual Encounter Profile questions 2 and 3 (SEP2 and SEP3) and by the EF domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean change in percentage of successful sexual attempts (SEP2 and SEP3) and IIEF-EF domain score significantly favored all doses of avanafil over placebo (P < 0.001). Secondary analyses demonstrated achievement of successful intercourse by subjects within 15 minutes of dosing. Of the 300 sexual attempts made during this interval, 64% to 71% were successful in avanafil-treated subjects compared with 27% in placebo-treated subjects. Successful intercourse was also demonstrated >6 hours post dosing, with 59% to 83% of the 80 sexual attempts successful in avanafil-treated subjects compared with 25% of placebo-treated subjects. The most commonly reported adverse events in subjects taking avanafil included headache, flushing, and nasal congestion; there were no drug-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Following 12 weeks of avanafil treatment without food or alcohol restrictions, significant improvements in sexual function were observed with all 3 doses of avanafil compared with placebo. Successful intercourse was observed as early as 15 minutes and >6 hours after dosing in some subjects. Avanafil was generally well tolerated for the treatment of ED.",

We report herein that, by using the entire tail domain of the smaller beta-synemin as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library, the LIM domain protein zyxin was identified as an interaction partner for human synemin. The synemin binding site in human zyxin was subsequently mapped to the C-terminal three tandem LIM-domain repeats, whereas the binding site for zyxin within beta-synemin is within the C-terminal 332 amino acid region (SNbetaTII) at the end of the long tail domain. Transient expression of SNbetaTII within mammalian cells markedly reduced zyxin protein level, blocked localization of zyxin at focal adhesion sites and resulted in decreased cell adhesion and increased motility. Knockdown of synemin expression with siRNAs within mammalian cells resulted in significantly compromised cell adhesion and cell motility.

Apoptosis is frequently induced to inhibit virus replication during infection of Enterovirus 71 (EV71). On the contrary, anti-apoptotic pathway, such as PI3K/Akt pathway, is simultaneously exploited by EV71 to accomplish the viral life cycle. The relationship by which EV71-induced apoptosis and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 infection altered Bax conformation and triggered its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria in RD cells. Subsequently, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol. We also found that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated during EV71 infection. The JNK specific inhibitor significantly inhibited Bax activation and cytochrome c release, suggesting that EV71-induced apoptosis was involved into a JNK-dependent manner. Meanwhile, EV71-induced Akt phosphorylation involved a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway enhanced JNK phosphorylation and the JNK-mediated apoptosis upon EV71 infection. Moreover, PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and negatively regulated the ASK1 activity. Knockdown of ASK1 significantly decreased JNK phosphorylation, which implied that ASK1 phosphorylation by Akt inhibited ASK1-mediated JNK activation. Collectively, these data reveal that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway limits JNK-mediated apoptosis by phosphorylating and inactivating ASK1 during EV71 infection.",

Women with a chief complaint of urinary incontinence responding to local newspaper advertisements were screened for inclusion. Potential candidates underwent medical history, physical (including gynecologic) examination, Papanicolaou test, urine culture and cytology, and multichannel urodynamic testing (including abdominal leak-point pressure measurements). A total of 38 women with documented genuine stress urinary incontinence (GSUI) or mixed incontinence were ultimately recruited into the study and fitted with either the standard or petite-sized Femassist device, according to their individual anatomy. Subjects were assessed before and after 1 month's use. Subjective assessment included quality of life questionnaires, daily voiding and activity diaries, as well as ongoing patient comments retrieved through daily telephone contact with the study nurse. Objective assessment included blinded evaluation of bacteriuria and urinary infection rates and vulvar irritation and ulceration rates.Results: To date, of the 38 women who have completed the study, over 50% reported an improvement in their quality of life including comfort, convenience, and overall satisfaction. In total for all patients studied, the device was worn for a total of 886 days; 82% of these were dry days. Similar results were obtained for women with GSUI and mixed incontinence. Factors associated with successful experience with the device included degree of tissue estrogenization (either naturally or via a topical estrogen preparation), manual dexterity, and degree of motivation. One in five women reported vulvar irritation or urethral discomfort at some point; this was not correlated with percentage of dry days.

Since 2008, propranolol has become the first choice of therapy for complicated IH, compared to conventional approach with systemic corticosteroid therapy as first-line treatment and then interferon or vincristine as second- or third-line therapeutic agents. We report three cases of hemangioma, successfully treated with propranolol. Oral propranolol was given for a period of 6 months with monthly follow up. All cases showed dramatic response without any relapse after stopping the treatment. Propranolol is novel and safe medication for treatment of infantile hemangioma.",

Aiming to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, we applied array-CGH to evaluate six patients carrying cytogenetically detected deletions of the short arm of chromosome 5 who were followed at a genetics community service. The patients' cytogenetic and clinical profiles were reevaluated. A database review was performed to predict additional genes and regulatory elements responsible for the characteristic phenotypic and behavioral traits of this disorder. Array-CGH analysis allowed for delineation of the terminal deletions, which ranged in size from approximately 11.2 Mb to 28.6 Mb, with breakpoints from 5p15.2 to 5p13. An additional dup(8)(p23) (3.5 Mb), considered to be a benign copy number variation, was also observed in one patient. The correlation coefficient value (\u03c1 = 0.13) calculated indicated the presence of a weak relationship between developmental delay and deletion size.

The current study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 5 mg vortioxetine compared to placebo after 6 wk of treatment in adults with MDD in an out-patient setting. Adults aged 18-75 yr, with a diagnosis of MDD and a baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score > 30, were randomized to receive either 5 mg vortioxetine or placebo over 6 wk, followed by a 2-wk medication-free discontinuation period.

BACKGROUND: Hemangioma in infants has a benign self-limited course, but the 10% of cases with complications need further treatment. Successful treatment with propranolol in western countries has been reported over the past few years. We evaluated the efficacy of propranolol for treating infantile hemangioma in Taiwanese newborns and young infants. METHODS: Patients below 1 year of age treated with propanolol between November 2009 and March 2011 were enrolled. Demographic data, clinical features, imaging findings, treatment regimens of propranolol, and outcome were investigated. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated with propranolol at a dose of 2-3 mg/kg/day. Seven (53.8%) patients had solitary hemangioma and six had multiple ones. The indications for treatment were risk of local event in nine patients, functional risk in four, local complication in one, and life-threatening complication in one. The median age for starting propranolol was 4 months (range: 1-11 months). Responses to propranolol, such as decolorization, regression in tumor size, or improvement of hemangioma-associated complications were observed in all patients within 1-2 weeks after treatment. Propranolol-associated adverse effects occurred in two patients. One infant had occasional tachypnea, and the other had occasional pale-looking appearance. The symptoms resolved after dosage tapering. CONCLUSION: Propranolol may be a promising therapeutic modality for infantile hemangioma. Therapeutic strategies are needed to evaluate the optimal treatment protocol and long-term adverse effects.",

Nitric oxide serves various roles in mammalian cells, including intracellular signaling and cell killing. To recognize the dynamic molecular changes in response to NO, microarray analysis was applied to human fibroblasts (IMR-90) exposed to sublethal levels of NO. Among the > 300 transcripts induced by NO, we focused on the mRNA encoded by the transforming growth factor-beta- (TGF-beta-) inducible early response 1 gene (TIEG1), which plays a pivotal role in TGF-beta-regulated cell growth control and apoptosis. Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that NO upregulates TIEG1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Anti-TGF-beta antibodies prevented TIEG1 mRNA induction by TGF-beta, but not the induction by NO. Conversely, NO had no effect on the amounts of total TGF-beta or its active form in culture supernatants. However, the half-life of the TIEG1 transcript was strongly increased (6-fold) upon exposure of the cells to NO. Thus, NO upregulates TIEG1 mRNA by stabilization independently of TGF-beta. The TIEG1 mRNA now joins heme oxygenase-1 mRNA in displaying regulation by NO-mediated stabilization.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have confirmed the short-term effectiveness of 8-methoxypsoralen bath PUVA therapy in patients with chronic palmoplantar dermatoses; however, little is known about long-term results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we examined the long-term results in 79 patients (mean age: 48 years) with chronic palmoplantar dermatoses who were treated with bath PUVA three times a week over an 8-year period. A good clinical response (a reduction of more than 50% of the skin lesions) occurred after a mean of 23 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 39 J/cm(2) in 51 patients (65%). In 2007 a questionnaire was sent to these 51 patients to assess the long-term outcome. RESULTS: With bath PUVA treatment, the best results were found in patients with hyperkeratotic eczema (17/22; 77% good clinical response) followed by patients with palmoplantar psoriasis (26/41; 63%) and patients with dyshidrotic eczema (8/16; 50%). Thirty-four patients (67%) answered the questionnaire after a mean follow-up interval of 4.3 years (10-87 months). Among these patients, 36% reported an improved course of disease after PUVA therapy with reduced frequency and/or intensity of the skin rash, and 29% of patients reported continued complete clearance. 79% of our patients reported a long-term reduction in the use of topical corticosteroids during the follow-up period (mean: 4.3 years). In addition, 67% of patients reported a lasting improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that bath PUVA may have a long-term, beneficial influence on the course of disease in a majority of patients with recalcitrant chronic palmoplantar dermatoses.",

OBJECTIVE: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with defects in at least eight genes. The biochemical function(s) of the FA proteins are unknown, but together they define the FA pathway, which is involved in cellular responses to DNA damage and in other cellular processes. It is currently unknown whether all FA proteins are involved in controlling a single function or whether some of the FA proteins have additional roles. The aim of this study was 1) to determine whether the FA group A and group C genes have identical or partially distinct functions, and 2) to have a better model for human FA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We generated mice with a targeted mutation in fanca and crossed them with fancc disrupted animals. Several phenotypes including sensitivity to DNA cross linkers and ionizing radiation, hematopoietic colony growth, and germ cell loss were analyzed in fanca-/-, fancc-/-, fanca/fancc double -/-, and controls. RESULTS: Fibroblast cells and hematopoietic precursors from fanca/fancc double-mutant mice were not more sensitive to MMC than those of either single mutant. fanca/fancc double mutants had no evidence for an additive phenotype at the cellular or organismal level. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a model where both FANCA and FANCC are part of a multi-protein nuclear FA complex with identical function in cellular responses to DNA damage and germ cell survival.",

The serum concentrations of TBG were also significantly lower in runners than their controls in the luteal phase in both seasons. The effect of jogging on thyroid hormones was less pronounced. Serum concentrations of TSH, T4, fT4, T3 and TBG were generally slightly higher in spring than in autumn.

Opsins allow selective activation of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons, or subclasses of interneurons, to study their activity patterns in distinct brain-states in vivo and to dissect their role in generation of synchrony and seizures. The influence of gliotransmission on epileptic network function is another topic of great interest that can be further explored by using light-activated Gq protein-coupled opsins for selective activation of astrocytes. The ever-growing optogenetic toolbox can also be combined with emerging techniques that have greatly expanded our ability to record specific subtypes of cortical and hippocampal neurons in awake behaving animals such as juxtacellular recording and two-photon guided whole-cell recording, to identify the specific subtypes of neurons that are altered in epileptic networks. Finally, optogenetic tools allow rapid and reversible suppression of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) activity upon photoactivation.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a major cause of cancer-related death, largely due to metastatic disease. To better understand PDAC metastatic spread and identify novel therapeutic targets, we analysed the proteome of primary tumours and matched lymph node (LN) metastases. As frozen specimens of metastatic lesions are scarce, we examined formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. This poses technical challenges because of the cross-linkages induced by fixation. Using laser capture microdissection (PALM system), we isolated malignant epithelia from seven FFPE primary PDAC tumours and matched LN metastases. Following dissection, samples were analysed in duplicate using Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT); this resulted in the identification of 1504 proteins, 854 of which were common to all samples analysed. Comparison of the obtained proteins with data from previous proteomics studies on pancreatic tissue, pancreatic juice, serum, and urine resulted in a less than 30% overlap, indicating that our study has substantially expanded the current database of proteins expressed in this malignancy. Statistical analysis further showed that 115/854 proteins (13.5%) were significantly differentially expressed (g-value > 3.8). Two proteins, S100P and 14-3-3 sigma, with highly significant g-values were confirmed to be significantly differentially expressed (S100P: p = 0.05 and 14-3-3 sigma: p < 0.001) in a larger series of 55 cases of matched primary PDAC and LN metastases using immunohistochemistry. Thus, laser capture microdissection of FFPE tissue coupled with downstream proteomic analysis is a valid approach for the investigation of metastatic PDAC. This is the first study to establish and compare the protein composition of primary PDAC and matched LN metastases, and has resulted in the identification of several potential epithelial-specific therapeutic targets, including 14-3-3 sigma and S100P.",

Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is caused by increased dose of genes present on human chromosome 21 (HSA21). The gene-dose hypothesis argues that a change in the dose of individual genes or regulatory sequences on HSA21 is necessary for creating DS-related phenotypes, including cognitive impairment. We focused on a possible role for Kcnj6, the gene encoding Kir3.2 (Girk2) subunits of a G-protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel. This gene resides on a segment of mouse Chromosome 16 that is present in one extra copy in the genome of the Ts65Dn mouse, a well-studied genetic model of DS. Kir3.2 subunit-containing potassium channels serve as effectors for a number of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors including GABAB receptors. Several studies raise the possibility that increased Kcnj6 dose contributes to synaptic and cognitive abnormalities in DS. To assess directly a role for Kcnj6 gene dose in cognitive deficits in DS, we produced Ts65Dn mice that harbor only 2 copies of Kcnj6 (Ts65Dn:Kcnj6++- mice). The reduction in Kcnj6 gene dose restored to normal the hippocampal level of Kir3.2. Long-term memory, examined in the novel object recognition test with the retention period of 24h, was improved to the level observed in the normosomic littermate control mice (2N:Kcnj6++). Significantly, both short-term and long-term potentiation (STP and LTP) was improved to control levels in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the Ts65Dn:Kcnj6++- mouse. In view of the ability of fluoxetine to suppress Kir3.2 channels, we asked if fluoxetine-treated DG slices of Ts65Dn:Kcnj6+++ mice would rescue synaptic plasticity. Fluoxetine increased STP and LTP to control levels. These results are evidence that increased Kcnj6 gene dose is necessary for synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Strategies aimed at pharmacologically reducing channel function should be explored for enhancing cognition in DS.",

We also reported that Rac1 is required for PC-3 cell diapedesis across a bone marrow endothelial cell layer. In the current study, we queried whether Rac3 and RhoG GTPases also have a role in prostate tumor cell diapedesis. Using specific siRNAs we demonstrate roles for each protein in PC-3 and C4-2 cell adhesion and diapedesis. We have shown that the chemokine CCL2 induces tumor cell diapedesis via Rac1 activation. Here we find that RhoG partially contributes to CCL2-induced tumor cell diapedesis. We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis. Finally, Rac1 leads to \u03b21 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells.

The malarial aspartic proteinases (plasmepsins) have been discovered in several species of Plasmodium, including all four of the human malarial pathogens. In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. The plasmepsins are produced from inactive zymogens, proplasmepsins, having unusually long N-terminal prosegments of more than 120 amino acids. Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that the conversion process of proplasmepsins to plasmepsins differs substantially from the gastric and plant aspartic proteinases. Instead of blocking substrate access to a pre-formed active site, the prosegment enforces a conformation in which proplasmepsin cannot form a functional active site. We have determined crystal structures of plasmepsin and proplasmepsin from P.vivax. The three-dimensional structure of P.vivax plasmepsin is typical of the monomeric aspartic proteinases, and the structure of P.vivax proplasmepsin is similar to that of P.falciparum proplasmepsin II. A dramatic refolding of the mature N terminus and a large (18 degrees ) reorientation of the N-domain between P.vivax proplasmepsin and plasmepsin results in a severe distortion of the active site region of the zymogen relative to that of the mature enzyme. The present structures confirm that the mode of inactivation observed originally in P.falciparum proplasmepsin II, i.e. an incompletely formed active site, is a true structural feature and likely represents the general mode of inactivation of the related proplasmepsins.",

OBJECTIVES: To develop predictive models of recovery from the vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to gather preliminary evidence on the impact of various psychotropic medications on the recovery process to support future randomized controlled trials. Design Longitudinal observational cohort design, in which demographic information, injury and acute care history, neuroimaging data, and an initial Disability Rating Scale (DRS) score were collected at the time of study enrollment. Weekly follow-up data, consisting of DRS score, current psychoactive medications, and medical complications, were gathered until discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. SETTING: Seven acute inpatient rehabilitation facilities in the United States and Europe with specialized programs for treating patients in the VS and MCS. PARTICIPANTS: People with TBI (N=124) who were in the VS or MCS 4 to 16 weeks after injury. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DRS score at 16 weeks after injury and time until commands were first followed (among those participants demonstrating no command following at study enrollment). Results DRS score at enrollment, time between injury and enrollment, and rate of DRS change during the first 2 weeks of poststudy observation were all highly predictive of both outcomes. No variables related to injury characteristics or lesions on neuroimaging were significant predictors. Of the psychoactive medications, amantadine hydrochloride was associated with greater recovery and dantrolene sodium was associated with less recovery, in terms of the DRS score at 16 weeks but not the time until commands were followed. More detailed analysis of the timing of functional improvement, with respect to the initiation of amantadine provided suggestive, but not definitive, evidence of the drug's causal role. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the feasibility of improving outcome prediction from the VS and MCS using readily available clinical variables and provide suggestive evidence for the effects of amantadine and dantrolene, but these results require confirmation through randomized controlled trials.",

OBJECT: The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has recently been approved in the US as an alternative to warfarin. The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). Confronted with this new problem, the authors reviewed their initial clinical experience. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed all cases of adult patients (age > 18 years) who sustained CHI secondary to ground-level falls and who presented to the authors' provisional regional Level I trauma center between February 2011 and May 2011. The authors divided these patients into 3 groups based on anticoagulant therapy: dabigatran, warfarin, and no anticoagulants. RESULTS: Between February 2011 and May 2011, CHIs from ground-level falls were sustained by 5 patients while on dabigatran, by 15 patients on warfarin, and by 25 patients who were not on anticoagulants. The treatment of the patients on dabigatran at the authors' institution had great diversity. Repeat CT scans obtained during reversal showed 4 of 5 patients with new or expanded hemorrhages in the dabigatran group, whereas the warfarin group had 3 of 15 (p = 0.03). The overall mortality rate for patients sustaining CHI on dabigatran was 2 (40%) of 5, whereas that of the warfarin group was 0 (0%) of 15 (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is critical for physicians involved in the care of patients with CHI on dabigatran to be aware of an elevated mortality rate if no treatment protocol or guideline is in place. The authors will soon implement a reversal management protocol for patients with CHI on dabigatran at their institution in an attempt to improve efficacy and safety in their treatment approach.",

BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract. HSCR has a complex pattern of inheritance and is sometimes associated with mutations in genes of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) and endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) signaling pathways, which are crucial for development of the enteric nervous system. METHODS: Using PCR amplification and direct sequencing, we screened for mutations and polymorphisms in the coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of the RET, GDNF, EDNRB, and EDN3 genes of 84 HSCR patients and 96 ethnically matched controls. RESULTS: We identified 10 novel and 2 previously described mutations in RET, and 4 and 2 novel mutations in EDNRB and in EDN3, respectively. Potential disease-causing mutations were detected in 24% of the patients. The overall mutation rate was 41% in females and 19% in males (P = 0.06). RET mutations occurred in 19% of the patients. R114H in RET was the most prevalent mutation, representing 7% of the patients or 37% of the patients with RET mutations. To date, such a high frequency of a single mutation has never been reported in unrelated HSCR patients. Mutations in EDNRB, EDN3, and GDNF were found in four, two, and none of the patients, respectively. Two patients with mutations in genes of the EDNRB pathway also harbored a mutation in RET. Three novel and three reported polymorphisms were found in EDNRB, EDN3, and GDNF. CONCLUSION: This study identifies additional HSCR disease-causing mutations, some peculiar to the Chinese population, and represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis of sporadic HSCR disease in Chinese.",

MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations lead to haplo-insufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of which resides in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. Patients' phenotype included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, heart defects or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all the three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Taking advantage of the zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent, embryo rescue, correlating with the severity of patients' phenotype, was observed. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.",

BACKGROUND: Inherited ventricular arrhythmias such as the long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts. The detailed pathogenetic mechanisms of inherited ventricular arrhythmias are still poorly understood because systematic investigations are difficult to perform due to low patient numbers and the lack of appropriate experimental models. However, recent advances in research and science have identified a genetic background for many of these diseases. PRESENT KNOWLEDGE: In LQTS, various mutations in different genes encoding for cardiac potassium and sodium channel proteins have been identified (\"channelopathy\"), and initial progress in genotype-phenotype correlation is made. Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene have also been identified in a subset of patients with Brugada syndrome, whereas a genetic background has not yet been demonstrated in idiopathic VF and right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia (RVO-VT). Very recently, mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene have been identified in CPVT and in a subgroup of patients with ARVC. Although several chromosomal loci were suggested, no other responsible genes or mutations have been found in autosomal dominant forms of ARVC. However, in Naxos disease, a recessive form of ARVC with coexpression of palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, a mutation in the plakoglobin gene has recently been discovered, thus underscoring the potential role of genetic alterations in cytoskeletal proteins in ARVC. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES: In the next years, significant progress in the genetic diagnosis pathophysiologic understanding of disease mechanisms, genotype-phenotype correlation, and the development of gene- or target-directed treatment strategies can be expected in the field of inherited ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms, including aspects of pathoanatomy, autonomic innervation, genetics, and genotype-phenotype correlations with their potential implications for diagnosis and treatment of inherited ventricular arrhythmias.",

Telomere dysfunction is linked with genome instability and premature aging. Roles for sirtuin proteins at telomeres are thought to promote lifespan in yeast and mammals. However, replicative lifespan of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shortens upon deletion of Rif1, a protein that limits the recruitment of the sirtuin histone deacetylase Sir2 to telomeres. Here we show that Rif1 maintains replicative lifespan by ultimately stabilizing another age-related chromosomal domain harboring the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. Deletion of Rif1 increases Sir2 localization to telomeres and the silent mating-type loci, while releasing a pool of the histone deacetylase from the intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) of rDNA. This is accompanied by a disruption of IGS1 silent chromatin assembly and increases in aberrant recombination within rDNA repeats. Lifespan defects linked with Rif1 deletion are abolished if rDNA repeats are forcibly stabilized via deletion of the replication fork-blocking protein Fob1. In addition, Sir2 overexpression prevents Rif1 deletion from disrupting Sir2 at IGS1 and shortening lifespan. Moreover, subjecting cells lacking Rif1 to caloric restriction increases IGS1 histone deacetylation and lifespan, while uncovering novel genetic interactions between RIF1 and SIR2. Our data indicate that Rif1 maintains lifespan-sustaining levels of Sir2 at rDNA by preventing excessive recruitment of the histone deacetylase to telomeric and silent mating-type loci. As sirtuin histone deacetylases, such as Sir2 or mammalian SIRT6, each operate at multiple age-related loci, we propose that factors limiting the localization of sirtuins to certain age-related loci can promote lifespan-sustaining roles of these sirtuins elsewhere in the genome.",

Pharmaceutical companies and the NIH have invested heavily in a variety of potential disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) but unfortunately all double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III studies of these drugs have failed to show statistically significant results supporting their clinical efficacy on cognitive measures. These negative results are surprising as most of these medications have the capability to impact the biomarkers which are associated with progression of Alzheimer's disease. Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures. We critically analyzed these studies, recommending seven lessons from these failures which should not be overlooked. Expert commentary: We suggest a new methodology for future treatment research in Alzheimer's disease considering early intervention with more focus on cognitive decline as a screening tool, more sophisticated exclusion criteria with more reliance on biomarkers, stratification of subjects based on the rate of cognitive decline aiming less heterogeneity, and a longer study duration with periodic assessment of cognition and activities of daily living during the study and also after a washout period.",

Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. HRC might play a particularly relevant role in the equine heart, given its slower resting heart rate (20-35 beats/min) and longer action potential duration (APD) (0.6-1.0 s) than are found in other mammals. The results from this study showed for the first time direct evidence that HRC protein in equine cardiac muscle was expressed in association with the SR membranes and that HRC transcriptional activity was three times higher in the ventricles compared to the atria. The predominance of HRC mRNA up-regulation in ventricular myocardium was specific to the horse heart, since a more even distribution between atria and ventricles was found in animals of similar body size or species, such as cattle or domestic donkeys.",

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess recurrence and pregnancy rates in women with ovarian endometrioma treated via ablation using plasma energy. DESIGN: Retrospective non-comparative pilot study including 55 patients treated during 28 months, with prospective recording of data (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Fifty-five consecutive women with pelvic endometriosis in whom ovarian endometriomas were managed solely via ablation using plasma energy. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. INTERVENTION: Endometrioma ablation using plasma energy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Information was obtained from the database of the North-West Inter Regional Female Cohort for Patients with Endometriosis, based on self-questionnaires completed before surgery, surgical and histologic data, and systematic recording of recurrences, pregnancy, and symptoms. Recurrences were assessed using pelvic ultrasound examination. Mean (SD) follow-up was 20.6 (7.2) months (range, 12-39 months). In 75% of patients, deep infiltrating endometriosis was treated, and 40% had colorectal involvement. Preoperative infertility was recorded in 42% of patients. The rate of postoperative recurrence was 10.9% for the entire series. Of 33 women who wished to conceive, 67% became pregnant, spontaneously in 59%. Time from surgery to the first pregnancy was 7.6 (4.3) months. After discontinuation of postoperative hormone therapy, the probability of not conceiving at 12 months was 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.53), and at 24 months was 0.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and pregnancy rates are encouraging in that they seem comparable to the best reported results after endometrioma cystectomy. Plasma energy may have an important role in the management of ovarian endometrioma in women seeking to conceive. Patients most in need of surgical procedures that can spare ovarian parenchyma, such as those with bilateral endometriomas or a history of ovarian surgery, may particularly benefit from ablation using plasma energy.",

BACKGROUND: Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, regulates immune responses associated with psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: ESTEEM 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30\u00a0mg twice daily for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: This phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized adults to apremilast or placebo (2\u00a0:\u00a01). At week 16, placebo patients switched to apremilast. At week 32, apremilast patients achieving > \u00a050% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) were rerandomized (1\u00a0:\u00a01) to continue apremilast or receive placebo. Upon loss of 50% of PASI improvement obtained at week 32, patients rerandomized to placebo resumed apremilast. RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat population (full analysis set) included 137 placebo and 274 apremilast patients.

Most patients rerandomized to apremilast at week 32 had a PASI 50 response at week 52 (80%). Patients treated with apremilast showed significant improvements in quality of life (as assessed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index) and pruritus at week 16 compared with placebo (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001). The exposure-adjusted incidence of adverse events did not increase with continued apremilast treatment for up to 52\u00a0weeks.

Thus, the discovery of reliable biomarkers for the management of TBI would improve clinical interventions. Inflammatory markers are particularly suited for biomarker discovery as TBI leads to very early alterations in inflammatory proteins. Using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation assay, we measured in patients that had suffered mild TBI (n = 10) or severe TBI (n = 10) with extra-cranial injury or extracranial injury only (EC) (n = 10), 92 inflammation-associated proteins in serum obtained: <1 hr (within 1-hour), 4-12 hr and 48-72 hr post injury. Changes were compared to healthy volunteers (HV). Our results identified CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL as novel early biomarkers of TBI. CST5 identified patients with severe TBI from all other cohorts and importantly was able to do so within the first hour of injury. AXIN1 and TRAIL were able to discriminate between TBI and HV at <1 hr. We conclude that CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL are worthy of further study in the context of a pre-hospital or pitch-side test to detect brain injury.",

PURPOSE: Loss of PTEN, which is common in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), results in activation of the mammalian target of rapapmycin (mTOR), thereby increasing mRNA translation of a number of key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mTOR. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent GBM and to further assess the toxicity of the drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CCI-779 was administered weekly at a dose of 250 mg intravenously for patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs). Patients not on EIAEDs were initially treated at 250 mg; however, the dose was reduced to 170 mg because of intolerable side effects. Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or patient withdrawal. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were enrolled; 29 were not on EIAEDs. The expected toxicity profile of increased lipids, lymphopenia, and stomatitis was seen. There were no grade IV hematological toxicities and no toxic deaths. One patient was progression free at 6 months. Of the patients assessable for response, there were 2 partial responses and 20 with stabilization of disease. The median time to progression was 9 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM. Despite initial disease stabilization in approximately 50% of patients, the durability of response was short. Because of the low toxicity profile, CCI-779 may merit exploration in combination with other modalities.",

Memory loss is the most profound clinical manifestation in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are poorly understood. Identification of the molecular pathways involved in the onset of cognitive deficits may lead to the identification of key events in the pathogenesis of AD. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and proteomic methods, here we identified learning-induced changes in the hippocampal proteome of non-transgenic (NonTg) and 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice, a widely used animal model of AD. We found that expression of 192 proteins was differentially regulated by learning in NonTg mice. Notably, of these 192 proteins, only 28 were also differentially regulated by learning in 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice, whereas the levels of 164 proteins were uniquely changed in NonTg mice but not in 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice. These data suggest that during learning, 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice fail to differentially regulate 164 proteins. Gene ontology and protein interaction analyses indicated that these proteins were overrepresented in RNA processing, specifically RNA transport, splicing and mRNA translation initiation pathways. These findings suggest that mRNA-processing events that take place during learning and memory are significantly altered in 3 \u00d7 Tg-AD mice.",

The success of pharmacological treatments in primary liver cancers is limited by the marked efficacy of mechanisms of chemoresistance already present in hepatocytes. The role of the nuclear receptor FXR is unclear. Although, in non-treated liver tumors, its expression is reduced, the refractoriness to anticancer drugs is high. Moreover, the treatment with cisplatin up-regulates FXR. The aim of this study was to investigate whether FXR is involved in stimulating chemoprotection/chemoresistance in healthy and tumor liver cells. In human hepatocytes, the activation of FXR with the agonist GW4064 resulted in a significant protection against cisplatin-induced toxicity. In human hepatoma Alexander cells, with negligible endogenous expression of FXR, GW4064 also protected against cisplatin-induced toxicity, but only if they were previously transfected with FXR/RXR. Investigation of 109 genes potentially involved in chemoresistance revealed that only ABCB4, TCEA2, CCL14, CCL15 and KRT13 were up-regulated by FXR activation both in human hepatocytes and FXR/RXR-expressing hepatoma cells. In both models, cisplatin, even in the absence of FXR agonists, such as bile acids and GW4064, was able to up-regulate FXR targets genes, which was due to FXR-mediated trans-activation of response elements in the promoter region. FXR-dependent chemoprotection was also efficient against other DNA-damaging compounds, such as doxorubicin, mitomycin C and potassium dichromate, but not against non-genotoxic drugs, such as colchicine, paclitaxel, acetaminophen, artesunate and sorafenib. In conclusion, ligand-dependent and independent activation of FXR stimulates mechanisms able to enhance the chemoprotection of hepatocytes against genotoxic compounds and to reduce the response of liver tumor cells to certain pharmacological treatments.",

Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele. The reduced function of TREM2 was speculated to be the main cause in the pathogenic effects of this risk variant, and TREM2 is highly expressed in white matter, as well as in the hippocampus and neocortex, which is partly consistent with the pathological features reported in AD brain, indicating the possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons. TREM2 also participates in the regulation of phagocytic pathways that are responsible for the removal of neuronal debris. In this article, we review the recent epidemiological findings of TREM2 that related with late-onset AD and speculate the possible roles of TREM2 in progression of this disease.

Five chromosome 5-specific probes from the latter region, designated the cri-du-chat critical region (CDCCR), were used to isolate 30 cosmids from the LANL chromosome 5 specific cosmid library. The 30 framework cosmids were used in a direct selection with three cDNA sources to isolate an initial set of expressed sequences. Nine unique cDNAs were found that hybridized to four discrete sets of cosmids in the CDCCR. The nine cDNAs are novel by sequence database comparisons, and conservatively represent four transcription units. More recently, we have also constructed a YAC contig of the CDCCR which spans approximately 2 Mb. As expected, ESTs derived from the nine novel cDNAs map back to the contig. Limited expression profiles of these cDNAs have been obtained. Two cDNAs that map to one discrete set of cosmids have different expression patterns, suggesting that they represent two different genes and increasing the number of putative genes to five.

OBJECTIVE: The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers. Primary peritoneal cancer is an aggressive malignancy which, due to the absence of a specific screening test, cannot be diagnosed in its early stages. As a risk-reducing option, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and mastectomy are often proposed in BRCA gene carriers. The effectiveness of a preventive surgical treatment is, however, unclear in the development of peritoneal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An extensive electronic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. RESULTS: The total number of patients who underwent prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was 1,830, of whom 28 presented with peritoneal cancer (1.53%). The age of the included patients ranged from 48 to 61 years. BRCA-1 was present in 9 out of 28 patients and BRCA-2 in 2 patients, while the type of BRCA was unclear in 17 patients. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 23 out of 28 patients, while oophorectomy was carried out in 5 patients.

Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms abnormal ubiquitinated and phosphorylated inclusions in brain tissues from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. We demonstrated that a specific aminoacidic interval (216-315) in the C-terminal region and the RNA-recognition motif 1 domain are both implicated in TDP-43 participation in SGs as their deletion prevented the recruitment of TDP-43 into SGs. Our data show that TDP-43 is a specific component of SGs and not of processing bodies, although we proved that TDP-43 is not necessary for SG formation, and its gene silencing does not impair cell survival during stress. The analysis of spinal cord tissue from ALS patients showed that SG markers are not entrapped in TDP-43 pathological inclusions. Although SGs were not evident in ALS brains, we speculate that an altered control of mRNA translation in stressful conditions may trigger motor neuron degeneration at early stages of the disease.",

The preoperative diagnosis of cavernous sinus invasion remains difficult and controversial, and there are currently no reliable histological or molecular markers that predict pituitary tumour behaviour and response to treatment. We evaluated 45 patients with pituitary adenoma. The results have shown that the sensitivity of MRI for indicating cavernous sinus invasion in this prospective study was 60%, specificity 85%, positive predictive value 83.33%, negative predictive value 62.96%. Forty-five specimens of pituitary adenomas were analyzed for expression of F8, VEGF, Ki-67, c-myc, bcl-2, nm23 and MMP-9 immunoreactivity using immunoperoxidase staining. MVD was assessed using F8-related antigen. The results have shown that MVD of invasive pituitary adenomas was significantly higher than that of noninvasive (P < 0.001). There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P < 0.001) and MMP-9 (P < 0.001). But c-myc LI and bcl-2 expression have no association with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas (P = 0.061 vs. P = 0.201). On the other hand, there is an inverse relationship between nm23 expression and tumor invasion (P < 0.001). In conclusion, parasellar extension of pituitary adenomas through the medial wall of the cavernous sinus diagnosed at surgery, can be determined by radiology with sensitive gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Although our study has shown that MVD and the expression of VEGF, Ki-67, nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, they are lack of specificity. These markers can only provide some useful informations on the therapeutic strategy of pituitary adenomas.",

The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. The dysregulation of NF-kappaB activity has been proposed to promote cell transformation in part by increasing apoptosis resistance, but it is not clear whether this is CYLD's only or predominant tumor-suppressing function. Here, we show that CYLD is also required for timely entry into mitosis. Consistent with a cell-cycle regulatory function, CYLD localizes to microtubules in interphase and the midbody during telophase, and its protein levels decrease as cells exit from mitosis. We identified the protein kinase Plk1 as a potential target of CYLD in the regulation of mitotic entry, based on their physical interaction and similar loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes. Our findings raise the possibility that, as with other genes regulating tumorigenesis, CYLD has not only tumor-suppressing (apoptosis regulation) but also tumor-promoting activities (enhancer of mitotic entry). We propose that this additional function of CYLD could provide an explanation for the benign nature of most cylindroma lesions.",

A search of the medical literature was conducted in the MEDLINE database for original research papers published between 01 January 2010 and 31 October 2014. RESULTS: Twenty one studies, including 11,524 adults were analyzed. Thirteen different novel therapeutic drug options were identified. Vedolizumab and golimumab were superior to placebo as induction and maintenance therapy. Tofacitinib showed dose related efficacy for induction therapy. Etrolizumab showed higher clinical remission rates compared to placebo. Phosphatidylcholine led to an improved clinical activity index. HMPL-004 may become a mesalamine alternative for mild to moderate UC. PF00547,659 was well tolerated. Statins were not beneficial for acute exacerbations of UC. Abatacept, rituximab and visilizumab did not lead to improved outcomes compared to placebo. Higher concentration of BMS 936557 was associated with improved efficacy compared to placebo.

Approximately 30% of diabetic patients develop nephropathy, the appearance of which is partially under genetic control. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has associated physiologic effects on the kidney. This study was conducted to examine the relationship between a newly identified and known polymorphism at the pronatriodilatin (PND) gene locus and renal involvement in type 1 diabetic subjects. Of 454 type 1 diabetic patients (219 men, 235 women), 323 showed no sign of nephropathy, 79 had incipient renal involvement, and 52 established nephropathy; 58 healthy control subjects were examined for comparison. Allele frequencies (C708 versus T708) were: 0.95 and 0.05 in normoalbuminuric patients, respectively; 0.88 and 0.12 in microalbuminuric patients; 0.96 and 0.04 both in those with overt nephropathy and in healthy control subjects (P = 0.011). Patients with incipient nephropathy were in disequilibrium compared with the total diabetic cohort (P = 0.02). In the same populations, an additional genotype for ScaI polymorphism of the PND gene was tested. The A1 and A2 allele frequencies were: 0.21 and 0.79 in normoalbuminuric patients; 0. 13 and 0.87 in microalbuminuric patients; 0.06 and 0.94 in type 1 diabetic subjects with overt nephropathy; and 0.20 and 0.80 in healthy control subjects, respectively (P < 0.0001). A subset of 55 normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes, well matched for clinical features, plasma ANP levels, and microvascular permeability to macromolecules, was investigated on the basis of the C708/T and A2/A1 polymorphisms. Both transcapillary escape rate of albumin (TERalb) and plasma ANP levels were significantly lower in patients with the T708 than with C708 allele, as well as in the A1 than in A2 allele (TERalb: T708 versus C708: 5.5+/-1.7 versus 7.8+/-2.0%/h, P = 0.0001; plasma ANP levels: 8.3+/-3.9 versus 15.3+/-7.7 pg/ml, P = 0.0003; A1 versus A2: 6.05+/-2.2 versus 7.3+/-2.1%/h, P = 0.044; 8.53+/-4.6 versus 14.5+/-7.4 pg/ml, P = 0.0024, respectively). Thus, in a large ethnically homogeneous cohort of diabetic subjects, our data show: (1) a significant association of C708/T polymorphism with microalbuminuria in long-term diabetes and with both lower plasma ANP levels and widespread albumin leakage; and (2) a strong association between ScaI polymorphism and both diabetic nephropathy and plasma ANP concentrations. These results suggest a possible role of PND gene in conferring protection from nephropathy and microvascular damage in type 1 diabetes.",

However, in the human carbonic anhydrase (CA) gene family, both the ubiquitously expressed CAII and the muscle specific CAIII appear to have such CpG islands although erythrocyte-specific CAI does not.

Analysis of a large trial by Westphal and colleagues (n = 240) showed a 29% risk reduction (P = 0.03) in the BCNU wafer-treated group over the course of the 30-month trial. Long-term follow-up of these patients was undertaken to determine the survival benefit at 2 and 3 years. METHODS: Survival proportions for the placebo and treatment groups over the 56-month study were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multiple-regression analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model included prognostic factors of age, KPS, and tumor type. A secondary analysis was conducted for 207 GBM patients. RESULTS: Of the 59 patients available for long-term follow-up, 11 were alive at 56 months: 9 had received BCNU wafers and 2 had received placebo wafers. Median survival of patients treated with BCNU wafers was 13.8 months vs 11.6 months in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (P = 0.018), representing a 27% significant risk reduction.

The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. In dark-adapted rats, neither bicuculline nor light enhanced DOPA accumulation 1 day after eye opening, but on the remaining days either treatment significantly augmented DA synthesis, and by day 15 the effects were as great as those observed in adult retinas. At each time point, the magnitude of the drug effect on DA synthesis in the dark was similar to that observed following light exposure. These results suggest that an endogenous GABAergic input to the DA neurons appears at the same time as the acquisition of the dopaminergic response to light. The effect of bicuculline treatment on DA synthesis in light-exposed animals was also assessed. At 4 and 7 days the drug significantly enhanced DOPA accumulation over that produced by exposure to light alone, but on later days bicuculline exerted no such additive effect. These data imply that early in the maturation of the light response mechanisms other than removal of an inhibitory GABAergic tone may be partially responsible for excitation of the DA neurons.",

The most commonly studied stem cells are those termed mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are easily isolated from bone marrow and adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to produce a wide array of cytokines that modulate the regeneration process. The ease of collection, propagation and use of these MSCs in therapy of traumatic, ischaemic and immune-mediated skin conditions is emerging. APPROACH AND EVIDENCE: In traumatic and ischaemic skin damage, MSCs are used in tissue-engineered skin and by direct injection into damaged tissue. For immune-mediated diseases, systemic administration of stem cells can modulate the immune system. The earliest clinical work has been with autologous stem cell sources, such as adipose tissue and bone marrow. In immune-mediated diseases, the MSCs are used to downregulate production of inflammatory cytokines and to block T-cell activation. Cells are generally given intravenously. Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been successfully treated in human clinical trials. Mesenchymal stem cells can also stimulate resident local cells, such as keratinocytes and progenitor cells, to proliferate, migrate and repair skin injury and disease. LOOKING AHEAD: The discovery of the MSC in adipose tissue has spawned a global effort to utilize these cells in therapy of a wide range of diseases of the skin. Reconstructive surgery, scar blocking and resolution and skin regeneration have all been shown to be possible in human and animal studies.",

PURPOSE: To determine the molecular basis of corneal avascularity during wound healing and determine the role of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors in corneal vasculogenesis. METHODS: The expression of proangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]; basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]; matrix metalloproteinase-2 [MMP-2]; and membrane-type 1-MMP [MT1-MMP]) and antiangiogenic factors (pigment epithelium-derived factor [PEDF]; angiostatin; restin; and endostatin) was analyzed in avascular corneas and in models of corneal neovascularization (bFGF pellet implantation, intrastromal injection of MT1-MMP cDNA, and surgically induced partial limbal deficiency). RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of antiangiogenic factors (PEDF, angiostatin, restin, and endostatin) and proangiogenic molecules (VEGF, bFGF, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP) in the cornea after wounding. Proangiogenic MMPs were upregulated in stromal fibroblasts in the vicinity of invading vessels following bFGF pellet implantation. Corneal neovascularization (NV) was also induced by intrastromal injection of MT1-MMP naked cDNA in conjunction with de-epithelialization. Partial limbal deficiency (HLD-) resulted in corneal NV in MMP-7 and MMP-3 knockout mice but not in wild type controls. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal angiogenic privilege is an active process involving the production of antiangiogenic factors to counterbalance the proangiogenic factors (which are upregulated after wound healing even in the absence of new vessels). Our finding that the potent antiangiogenic factors, angiostatin and endostatin, are colocalized with several MMPs during wound healing suggests that MMPs may be involved in the elaboration of these antiangiogenic molecules by proteolytic processing of substrates within the cornea.",

Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and tendon areflexia, is generally considered as a clinical variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. However some features of the disease are still debated, particularly regarding possible central nervous system involvement. After presenting two new cases of MFS, the authors provide a critical review of the literature and discuss the nosographical position of the disease. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: MFS is a predominantly axonal inflammatory neuropathy with prevailing involvement of oculomotor nerves. It is associated to spinal multi or polyneuropathy, which in mildly affected cases is manifested by areflexia, while in severe ones it can be responsible of sense and/or motor impairment. In addition to peripheral neuropathy CNS involvement, exclusive or more marked in posterior fossa, occurs not infrequently. The prognosis of the disease is often benign, but disabling or even fatal outcome is possible. Corticosteroid treatment, possibly because of antiinflammatory and/or immunosuppressive action, could be effective in some patients. Finally, in spite of some similarities with GBS, MFS should be considered as a separate entity with its own nosographical position.",

Isotretinoin is a potent retinoic acid used in the treatment of skin disorders. Though very effective, it is teratogenic if administered during pregnancy, and its teratogenic effect may be related to the normal activity of retinoids as signalling molecules in the embryo. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it has been suggested that it causes its characteristic pattern of defects that includes heart defects, by inhibiting the migration of neural crest cells. However, other effects on cells are known. We studied early cardiac cell proliferation using incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and detection with a monoclonal anti-BrdU. Proliferation in heart tissue of whole embryo cultures was inhibited in medium with 10(-6) M isotretinoin to 62% of the control level in myocardium. We studied its effects in culture on precardiac explant development in the absence of the neural crests. Culture of precardiac mesodermal-endodermal explants revealed that development of heart vesicles from the mesoderm was little affected, but the development of heartbeat was inhibited depending on dose in the 10(-5) to 10(-7) M range. The effect on development of contractions was augmented in the presence of serum; it could be duplicated by all-trans-retinoic acid, and it was reversible. Synthesis of the alpha-actin isotype, analyzed by isoelectric focusing, was found to be inhibited or delayed. The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis.",

High doses of intravenous iron have a role in the treatment of a number of clinical situations associated with iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and blood loss. In the presence of functioning erythropoiesis, iron supplementation alone may be adequate to replenish iron stores and restore blood loss. Where hormone replacement with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent is required, iron adequacy will optimize treatment. Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron. The clinical situations where high doses of iron are commonly required are reviewed. These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment. The literature indicates that high doses of iron are required, with levels of 1500 mg in nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and up to 3600 mg in inflammatory bowel disease. New formulations of intravenous iron have recently been introduced that allow clinicians to administer high doses of iron in a single administration. Ferumoxytol is available in the US, has a maximum dose of 510 mg iron in a single administration, but is limited to use in chronic kidney disease. Ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered in doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, up to a ceiling dose of 1000 mg. A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indications. The latest introduction is iron isomaltoside 1000. Again, a test dose is not required, and it can be delivered rapidly as an infusion (in an hour), allowing even higher doses of iron to be administered in a single infusion, ie, 20 mg/kg body weight with no ceiling. This will allow clinicians to achieve high-dose repletion more frequently as a single administration. Treatment options for iron repletion have taken a major leap forward in the past two years, especially to meet the demand for high doses given as a single administration.",

BACKGROUND: Since the publication of the first European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines in 2005 on the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS; also known as Willis-Ekbom disease), there have been major therapeutic advances in the field. Furthermore, the management of RLS is now a part of routine neurological practice in Europe. New drugs have also become available, and further randomized controlled trials have been undertaken. These guidelines were undertaken by the EFNS in collaboration with the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society. OBJECTIVES: To provide an evidence-based update of new treatments published since 2005 for the management of RLS. METHODS: First, we determined what the objectives of management of primary and secondary RLS should be. We developed the search strategy and conducted a review of the scientific literature up to 31 December 2011 (print and electronic publications) for the drug classes and interventions employed in RLS treatment. Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations made according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. RECOMMENDATIONS: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. However, for the long-term treatment for RLS, rotigotine is considered effective, gabapentin enacarbil is probably effective, and ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin are considered possibly effective. Cabergoline has according to our criteria a level A recommendation, but the taskforce cannot recommend this drug because of its serious adverse events.",

The potential oncogenic role of EZH2 and its clinical/prognostic significance, however, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are unclear. In this study, the methods of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization were used to examine protein expression and amplification of EZH2 in 98 pretreatment biopsy specimens of ESCC who received definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). High expression of EZH2 and amplification of EZH2 was found in 54.1% and 12.0% of ESCCs, respectively. High EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with increased cell proliferation (p = 0.009), high histopathological grade (p = 0.002), regional (p = 0.025) and distant lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001) and lack of clinical complete response to CRT (p = 0.028). Univariate analysis revealed that high expression of EZH2 was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p = 0.003), poor progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, high expression of EZH2, together with lack of clinical complete response, were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors of MFS, PFS and DSS for patients with ESCC. These findings suggest that high expression of EZH2 correlates with tumor aggressiveness and adverse patient outcome in ESCC treated with definitive CRT. Evaluation of EZH2 expressions might be useful for predicting tumor response to CRT and prognosis for patients with ESCC.",

PR-Set7 is the sole monomethyltransferase responsible for H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) that is the substrate for further methylation by Suv4-20h1/h2. PR-Set7 is required for proper cell cycle progression and is subject to degradation by the CRL4(Cdt2) ubiquitin ligase complex as a function of the cell cycle and DNA damage. This report demonstrates that PR-Set7 is an important downstream effector of CRL4(Cdt2) function during origin of DNA replication licensing, dependent on Suv4-20h1/2 activity. Aberrant rereplication correlates with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Expression of a degradation-resistant PR-Set7 mutant in the mouse embryo that is normally devoid of Suv4-20 does not compromise development or cell cycle progression unless Suv4-20h is coexpressed. PR-Set7 targeting to an artificial locus results in recruitment of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in a manner dependent on Suv4-20h and H4K20me3. Consistent with this, H4K20 methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes.",

Titin is the largest protein known, and is essential for organising muscle sarcomeres. It has many domains with a variety of functions, and stretches from the Z-line to the M-line in the muscle sarcomere. Close to the M-line, titin contains a kinase domain, which is known to phosphorylate the Z-line protein telethonin in developing muscle (Mayans, O., van der Ven, P. F., Wilm, M., Mues, A., Young, P., Furst, D. O., Wilmanns, M. and Gautel, M. (1998) Nature 395, 863-869). This phosphorylation is thought to be important for initiating or regulating myofibrillogenesis. We used a gene-targeting approach in cultured myoblasts to truncate the titin gene so that the kinase domain and other domains downstream of the kinase were not expressed. We recovered cells in which one allele was targeted. We found that these cells expressed both the full-length and a truncated titin that was approximately 0.2 MDa smaller than the corresponding band from wild-type cells. Myofibrillogenesis in these cells was impaired, in that the myotubes were shorter, and the organisation of the muscle sarcomeres, M- and Z-lines was poorer than in wild-type cells. There was also an overall reduction in levels of titin and skeletal myosin expression. These results suggest that the activity of the titin kinase domain and downstream sequence are important in organising myofibrils both at the M- and the Z-line early in myofibrillogenesis.",

This approach compares one allele against the other in the same subject. AEI ratios ranged from 0.3 to 4 in prefrontal cortex, demonstrating the presence of strong cis-acting factors in mRNA expression. Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males. MAOA methylation ratios for the three- and four-repeat pVNTR alleles of MAOA did not correlate with X-chromosome inactivation ratios, determined at the X-linked androgen receptor locus, suggesting an alternative process of dosage compensation in females. The extent of allelic MAOA methylation was highly variable and correlated with AEI (R2=0.5 and 0.7 at two CpG loci), indicating that CpG methylation regulates gene expression. Genetic factors appeared also to contribute to the AEI ratios. Genotyping of 13 MAOA polymorphisms in female subjects showed strong association with a haplotype block spanning from the pVNTR to the marker SNP.

BACKGROUND: Molecular signatures in cancer tissue may be useful for diagnosis and are associated with survival. We used results from high-density tissue microarrays (TMAs) to define combinations of candidate biomarkers associated with the rate of prostate cancer progression after radical prostatectomy that could identify patients at high risk for recurrence. METHODS: Fourteen candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer for which antibodies are available included hepsin, pim-1 kinase, E-cadherin (ECAD; cell adhesion molecule), alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase, and EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2, a transcriptional repressor). TMAs containing more than 2000 tumor samples from 259 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer were studied with these antibodies. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Recurrence was defined as a postsurgery PSA level of more than 0.2 ng/mL. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i.e., a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence in a training set of 103 patients (relative risk [RR] = 2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 5.81; P =.021), in a validation set of 80 patients (RR = 3.72, 95% CI = 1.27 to 10.91; P =.009), and in the combined set of 183 patients (RR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.56 to 5.61; P<.001). EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with disease recurrence even after adjusting for clinical parameters, such as tumor stage, Gleason score, and PSA level (hazard ratio = 3.19, 95% CI = 1.50 to 6.77; P =.003). CONCLUSION: EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and may be useful in defining a cohort of high-risk patients.",

OBJECTIVES: Antiestrogen therapy can cause vasomotor symptoms similar to those occurring during menopause, including hot flashes. Recent studies suggest that acupuncture is effective in reducing vasomotor symptoms in patients with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for treatment of hot flashes in Korean patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen therapy. DESIGN: This was a prospective single-arm observational study using before and after measurements. SETTINGS/LOCATION: The study was located at the East-West Medical Center at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center, Daegu, Korea. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 10 patients with breast cancer who were undergoing antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or anastrozole and who were suffering from hot flashes. INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture was administered 3 times a week for 4 consecutive weeks, for 20\u00b15 minutes at each session. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measure was severity of hot flashes assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and total hot flash score. RESULTS: During treatment, severity of hot flashes was reduced by 70%-95% in all patients. Acupuncture significantly alleviated severity of hot flashes assessed by a visual analogue scale (F=30.261; p<0.001) as well as the total hot flash score (F=21.698; p=0.006). Four (4) weeks after the final treatment, symptoms were not aggravated. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture appeared to provide effective relief from hot flashes among Korean women receiving antiestrogen therapy after surgery for breast cancer, and the effects lasted for at least 1 month after termination of treatment. A randomized controlled prospective study with a larger sample size is required to clarify the role of acupuncture in the management of hot flashes in Korean patients with breast cancer.",

The treatment of disseminated prostate cancer remains a great challenge in current oncology practice. The proliferation of prostate cancer cells is testosterone-driven, but clonal selection during androgen deprivation therapy promotes the development of androgen-independent (hormone-refractory) cells, which become phenotypically dominant. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is capable of activating the androgen receptor pathway, even in the absence of the ligand. The detection of phenotypic changes associated with the development of androgen independence may influence patient management, suggesting the initiation of a second-line therapy. This study aimed to establish the level of HER2 expression in a number of prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and DU145) in order that they be used as models in further studies, and to evaluate the binding and cellular processing of [(111)In]-labeled trastuzumab and the anti-HER2 synthetic Affibody molecule ABY-025 in these cell lines. The expression of HER2 was demonstrated and quantified in all three tested prostate cancer cell-lines. Studies on cellular processing demonstrated that internalization of both conjugates increased continuously during the whole incubation. The internalization rate was approximately equal for both monoclonal antibodies and Affibody molecules. In both cases, internalization was moderately rapid. Such features would definitely favor the use of radiometal labels for trastuzumab and, most likely, for affibody molecules. The level of HER2 expression in these cell lines is sufficient for in vivo molecular imaging.",

One approach that has begun to shed light on the PD pathogenic pathways is the identification of disease genes through genetic linkage or association studies. These studies have revealed that several kinases may be involved in PD, as some PD genes encode kinases themselves while other PD genes are found in the same cellular pathways as kinases. Two of these kinases stand out as potential drug targets for novel PD therapy, namely leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) phosphorylating polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2). Indeed, both \u03b1- syn and LRRK2 show genetic linkage as well as genetic association with PD, indicating their relevance to a large number of PD cases. Also, due to the dominant mode of \u03b1-syn and LRRK2 inheritance and based on current knowledge of LRRK2 and \u03b1-syn phosphorylation by PLK2, inhibition of LRRK2 and PLK2 may constitute a potential therapy for PD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To identify risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage, we designed a case-control study of men and women 18 to 49 years of age (the Hemorrhagic Stroke Project [HSP]). This report focuses on SAH. METHODS: Patients were recruited from 44 hospitals in the United States. Cases with SAH must have had a ruptured aneurysm documented by angiography or surgery. Two controls, identified by random digit dialing and matched to each patient for age, sex, race, and telephone exchange, were sought for each case subject. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 1999, 425 patients with SAH were enrolled in HSP, and 312 cases met the criteria for aneurysmal SAH. The present analyses also included 618 matched controls. Of the 312 cases, 66% were current cigarette smokers compared with 30% of controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.73; 95% CI, 2.67 to 5.21). Cocaine use within the previous 3-day period was reported by 3% of cases and no controls (bivariate exact OR, 24.97; 95% exact CI, 3.95 to infinity; adjusted estimate not calculable). Other independent risk factors in the multivariable model included hypertension (adjusted OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.48 to 3.29), low body mass index (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.35), primary family history of hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.73 to 8.46), caffeine in pharmaceutical products (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 5.20), lower educational achievement (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.87), and nicotine in pharmaceutical products (adjusted estimate not calculable). CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal SAH may be largely a preventable disease among the young and middle-aged because several prevalent risk factors can be modified by medication (eg, hypertension) or behavioral change (eg, cigarette smoking, cocaine use). The association of caffeine and nicotine in pharmaceutical products and aneurysmal SAH warrants further study.",

We performed two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials, one involving 42 subjects with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and the other involving 31 subjects with potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis (PSPP). In each trial, two 8-week treatment periods were separated by an active washout period of at least 9 weeks. The primary outcome variable in the HypoPP trial was the occurrence of an intolerable increase in attack severity or frequency (end point). The primary outcome variable in the PSPP trial was the number of attacks per week. In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects.

An ecological study was conducted using averaged prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral degeneration, polyneuropathies, affective psychosis and suicide attempts in selected Andalusian health districts categorized into areas of high and low environmental pesticide exposure based on the number of hectares devoted to intensive agriculture and pesticide sales per capita. A total of 17,429 cases were collected from computerized hospital records (minimum dataset) between 1998 and 2005. Prevalence rates and the risk of having Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and suicide were significantly higher in districts with greater pesticide use as compared to those with lower pesticide use. The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts. In conclusion, this study supports and extends previous findings and provides an indication that environmental exposure to pesticides may affect the human health by increasing the incidence of certain neurological disorders at the level of the general population.",

Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved.",

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some studies have indicated that dietary cholesterol has a role in the progression of liver fibrosis. We investigated the mechanisms by which dietary cholesterol might contribute to hepatic fibrogenesis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet or a control diet for 4 weeks; liver fibrosis then was induced by bile-duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated from mice fed high-cholesterol diets or from Niemann-Pick type C1-deficient mice, which accumulate intracellular free cholesterol. RESULTS: After bile-duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration, mice fed high-cholesterol diets had significant increases in liver fibrosis and activation of HSCs compared with mice fed control diets. There were no significant differences in the degree of hepatocellular injury or liver inflammation, including hepatocyte apoptosis or Kupffer cell activation, between mice fed high-cholesterol or control diets. Levels of free cholesterol were much higher in HSCs from mice fed high-cholesterol diets than those fed control diets. In cultured HSCs, accumulation of free cholesterol in HSCs increased levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to down-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (a pseudoreceptor for transforming growth factor [TGF]\u03b2); the HSCs became sensitized to TGF\u03b2-induced activation. Liver fibrosis was not aggravated by the high-cholesterol diet in C3H/HeJ mice, which express a mutant form of TLR4; HSCs that express mutant TLR4 were not activated by accumulation of free cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary cholesterol aggravates liver fibrosis because free cholesterol accumulates in HSCs, leading to increased TLR4 signaling, down-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor, and sensitization of HSC to TGF\u03b2. This pathway might be targeted by antifibrotic therapies.",

PURPOSE: Protein kinase plays an essential role in controlling cardiac growth and hypertrophic remodeling. The cardiac troponin I-interacting kinase (TNNI3K), a novel cardiac specific kinase, is associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, the precise function of TNNI3K in regulating cardiac remodeling has remained controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy generated by transverse aortic constriction, myocardial TNNI3K expression was significantly increased by 1.62 folds (P<0.05) after constriction for 15 days. To investigate the role of TNNI3K in cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic mouse lines with overexpression of human TNNI3K specifically in the heart. At the age of 3 months, the high-copy-number TNNI3K transgenic mice demonstrated a phenotype of concentric hypertrophy with increased heart weight normalized to body weight (1.31 fold, P<0.01). Echocardiography and non-invasive hemodynamic assessments showed enhanced cardiac function. No necrosis or myocyte disarray was observed in the heart of TNNI3K transgenic mice. This concentric hypertrophy maintained up to 12 months of age without cardiac dysfunction. The phospho amino acid analysis revealed that TNNI3K is a protein-tyrosine kinase. The yeast two-hybrid screen and co-immunoprecipitation assay identified cTnI as a target for TNNI3K. Moreover, TNNI3K overexpression induced cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/Ser23 in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that TNNI3K is a novel upstream regulator for cTnI phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: TNNI3K promotes a concentric hypertrophy with enhancement of cardiac function via regulating the phosphorylation of cTnI. TNNI3K could be a potential therapeutic target for preventing from heart failure.",

In vitro analysis of Rtt109 revealed that Vps75, a Nap1 family histone chaperone, could also stimulate Rtt109-dependent acetylation of H3K56. However, the molecular function of the Rtt109-Vps75 complex remains elusive. Here we have probed the molecular functions of Vps75 and the Rtt109-Vps75 complex through biochemical, structural and genetic means. We find that Vps75 stimulates the kcat of histone acetylation by approximately 100-fold relative to Rtt109 alone and enhances acetylation of K9 in the H3 histone tail. Consistent with the in vitro evidence, cells lacking Vps75 showed a substantial reduction (60%) in H3K9 acetylation during S phase. X-ray structural, biochemical and genetic analyses of Vps75 indicate a unique, structurally dynamic Nap1-like fold that suggests a potential mechanism of Vps75-dependent activation of Rttl09.

Patients were treated with one of three anti-TNF medications: etanercept (n = 733), infliximab (n = 894), or adalimumab (n = 1,071). We identified a SNP (rs6427528) at the 1q23 locus that was associated with change in disease activity score (\u0394DAS) in the etanercept subset of patients (P = 8 \u00d7 10(-8)), but not in the infliximab or adalimumab subsets (P>0.05). The SNP is predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding site motifs in the 3' UTR of an immune-related gene, CD84, and the allele associated with better response to etanercept was associated with higher CD84 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P = 1 \u00d7 10(-11) in 228 non-RA patients and P = 0.004 in 132 RA patients). Consistent with the genetic findings, higher CD84 gene expression correlated with lower cross-sectional DAS (P = 0.02, n = 210) and showed a non-significant trend for better \u0394DAS in a subset of RA patients with gene expression data (n = 31, etanercept-treated). A small, multi-ethnic replication showed a non-significant trend towards an association among etanercept-treated RA patients of Portuguese ancestry (n = 139, P = 0.4), but no association among patients of Japanese ancestry (n = 151, P = 0.8). Our study demonstrates that an allele associated with response to etanercept therapy is also associated with CD84 gene expression, and further that CD84 expression correlates with disease activity. These findings support a model in which CD84 genotypes and/or expression may serve as a useful biomarker for response to etanercept treatment in RA patients of European ancestry.",

The inflammatory diseases ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease constitute the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, significantly impacting on patient quality of life and often requiring prolonged treatment. Existing therapies for IBD are not effective for all patients, and an unmet need exists for additional therapies to induce and maintain remission. Here we describe the mechanism of action of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib, for the treatment of IBD and the effect of JAK inhibition on the chronic cycle of inflammation that is characteristic of the disease. The pathogenesis of IBD involves a dysfunctional response from the innate and adaptive immune system, resulting in overexpression of multiple inflammatory cytokines, many of which signal through JAKs. Thus JAK inhibition allows multiple cytokine signaling pathways to be targeted and is expected to modulate the innate and adaptive immune response in IBD, thereby interrupting the cycle of inflammation. Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted immunomodulator for IBD. Clinical development of tofacitinib and other JAK inhibitors is ongoing, with the aspiration of providing new treatment options for IBD that have the potential to deliver prolonged efficacy and clinically meaningful patient benefits.",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic autoimmune disease and its onset and prognosis are controlled by genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. The HLA locus, particularly HLA-DRB1, is its strongest genetic risk determinant across ethnicities. Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA. However, they cover only a part of its genetic components and their relative contribution is different between populations. To identify novel genetic determinants, we took a candidate gene approach in a trans-ethnic manner. After critical selection of 169 genes based on their immunological function, we performed SNP discovery of these genes by the resequencing of exons and surrounding areas using European and Japanese DNAs. We then generated a panel of 1,509 SNPs for case-control association study in both populations. The DerSimonian-Laird test for meta-analysis, using the combined results of the two populations, identified rs7551957 at the 5'-flanking region of the low-affinity Fc-gamma receptor IIa (FCGR2A) gene as the strongest candidate for the association (p = 8.6 \u00d7 10(-5), odds ratio = 1.58 with 95%CI 1.25-1.99).

Here we show that polyadenylated 3' termini in three yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Debaryomyces hansenii) are remarkably heterogeneous. Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the average yeast gene has an \"end zone,\" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A) sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D. hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors.",

Employing a model system of dinucleosomes rather than mononucleosomes, we demonstrate that remodeling leads to ordered and efficient disassembly of one of the two nucleosomes. An H2A/H2B dimer is first rapidly displaced, and then, in a slower reaction, an entire histone octamer is lost. Nucleosome disassembly by SWI/SNF did not require additional factors such as chaperones or acceptors of histones. Observations in single molecules as well as bulk measurement suggest that a key intermediate in this process is one in which a nucleosome is moved toward the adjacent nucleosome.

Here we report a dominant mutation in Gars that causes neuropathy in the mouse. Importantly, both sensory and motor axons are affected, and the dominant phenotype is not caused by a loss of the GlyRS aminoacylation function. Mutant mice have abnormal neuromuscular junction morphology and impaired transmission, reduced nerve conduction velocities, and a loss of large-diameter peripheral axons, without defects in myelination. The mutant GlyRS enzyme retains aminoacylation activity, and a loss-of-function allele, generated by a gene-trap insertion, shows no dominant phenotype in mice.

UNLABELLED: Bile acid metabolism is intimately linked to the control of energy homeostasis and glucose and lipid metabolism. The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a major role in the enterohepatic cycling of bile acids, but the impact of nutrients on bile acid homeostasis is poorly characterized. Metabolically active hepatocytes cope with increases in intracellular glucose concentrations by directing glucose into storage (glycogen) or oxidation (glycolysis) pathways, as well as to the pentose phosphate shunt and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Here we studied whether the glucose nonoxidative hexosamine biosynthetic pathway modulates FXR activity. Our results show that FXR interacts with and is O-GlcNAcylated by O-GlcNAc transferase in its N-terminal AF1 domain. Increased FXR O-GlcNAcylation enhances FXR gene expression and protein stability in a cell type-specific manner. High glucose concentrations increased FXR O-GlcNAcylation, hence its protein stability and transcriptional activity by inactivating corepressor complexes, which associate in a ligand-dependent manner with FXR, and increased FXR binding to chromatin. Finally, in vivo fasting-refeeding experiments show that FXR undergoes O-GlcNAcylation in fed conditions associated with increased direct FXR target gene expression and decreased liver bile acid content. CONCLUSION: FXR activity is regulated by glucose fluxes in hepatocytes through a direct posttranslational modification catalyzed by the glucose-sensing hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.",

OBJECTIVES: Avanafil is a highly selective phosfosdiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5 inhibitor), with rapid onset of action, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). It had been recently commercialized in Spain. This article presents a detailed review of the available literature, where the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avanafil were evaluated. METHODS: A systematic literature search using the Medline database was performed. The search included the terms Avanafil and erectile dysfunction. The pivotal studies of clinical development of the drug, and also those randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, well-designed studies were analyzed. We included those studies published in English up to January 2014. Likewise, studies of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug were also included. RESULTS: The avanafil pivotal studies, conducted in general population of patients with ED, patients with Diabetes mellitus type I and II and patients with ED secondary to nerve sparing radical prostatectomy were analyzed. In all these studies, avanafil demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in erectile function (IIEF), and all the coprimary outcomes (SEP2 and SEP3) compared to placebo. Also, a good tolerance profile and few side effects compared to placebo were evident. CONCLUSIONS: Avanafil is a selective PDE5 inhibitors, that is rapidly absorbed and that has a short time to peak response. It found to be effective in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted in men with erectile dysfunction, including in patients with diabetes mellitus and after radical prostatectomy.

Many studies on the various treatments aimed at preventing cerebral vasospasm have been carried out, but evidence of efficacy is limited. Our aim was to review the literature on the various therapies for which there is scientific evidence of protection against cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: MEDLINE search (1950 to the october 2009) and review of articles found on the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The search was restricted to articles in English, French, and Spanish. The keywords were cerebral vasospasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, therapy, nimodipine, triple H, clazosentan, statins, and magnesium in addition to the word forms derived from them. We also searched manually for references cited in the selected articles. A title was included if it was a randomized controlled trial, meta-analysis, nonrandomized clinical trial, descriptive study, observational study with statistical analysis, opinion article, or expert review. RESULTS: Part 1 analyzed treatment with calcium antagonists and triple-H therapy (hypertension, hemodilution, and hypervolemia). Part 2 analyzed new therapies such as clazosentan, magnesium, and statins. A total of 597 titles were located; 283 were initially selected. The 61 articles finally selected for review were of the following types: 2 opinion articles, 21 randomized controlled trials, 22 expert review articles, 3 meta-analyses, 4 nonrandomized clinical trials, 1 descriptive study, and 5 observational studies with statistical analysis. Three studies (2 meta-analyses and 1 randomized controlled trial) demonstrated that nimodipine use confers benefits (reduced morbidity and mortality) for patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Statistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Current treatment options for epilepsy are inadequate, as too many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from negative side effects of treatment. In addition to these clinical challenges, our scientific understanding of epilepsy is incomplete.

Using such tools, it is now possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention strategies. Such specificity of intervention also has the potential for direct therapeutic benefits, allowing healthy tissue and network functions to continue unaffected.

In osteosarcoma, a primary mesenchymal bone cancer occurring predominantly in younger patients, invasive tumour growth leads to extensive bone destruction. This process is insufficiently understood, cannot be efficiently counteracted and calls for novel means of treatment. The endocytic collagen receptor, uPARAP/Endo180, is expressed on various mesenchymal cell types and is involved in bone matrix turnover during normal bone growth. Human osteosarcoma specimens showed strong expression of this receptor on tumour cells, along with the collagenolytic metalloprotease, MT1-MMP. In advanced tumours with ongoing bone degeneration, sarcoma cells positive for these proteins formed a contiguous layer aligned with the degradation zones. Remarkably, osteoclasts were scarce or absent from these regions and quantitative analysis revealed that this scarcity marked a strong contrast between osteosarcoma and bone metastases of carcinoma origin. This opened the possibility that sarcoma cells might directly mediate bone degeneration. To examine this question, we utilized a syngeneic, osteolytic bone tumour model with transplanted NCTC-2472 sarcoma cells in mice. When analysed in vitro, these cells were capable of degrading the protein component of surface-labelled bone slices in a process dependent on MMP activity and uPARAP/Endo180. Systemic treatment of the sarcoma-inoculated mice with a mouse monoclonal antibody that blocks murine uPARAP/Endo180 led to a strong reduction of bone destruction. Our findings identify sarcoma cell-resident uPARAP/Endo180 as a central player in the bone degeneration of advanced tumours, possibly following an osteoclast-mediated attack on bone in the early tumour stage. This points to uPARAP/Endo180 as a promising therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, with particular prospects for improved neoadjuvant therapy.",

The clinical significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been reported in a variety of human carcinomas including breast cancer. However, molecular signature of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their prognostic value in breast cancer patients remain elusive. We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors. We conducted retrospective studies in a diverse cohort of breast cancer patients with a 1-5\u00a0year tumor relapse versus those with up to 7\u00a0years relapse-free survival. The RNAs were extracted from the frozen tumor specimens at the time of diagnosis and subjected to microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Paraffin-embedded tissues were also subjected to immunohistochemistry staining. We determined that a network of immune function genes involved in B cell development, interferon signaling associated with allograft rejection and autoimmune reaction, antigen presentation pathway, and cross talk between adaptive and innate immune responses were exclusively upregulated in patients with relapse-free survival. Among the 299 genes, five genes which included B cell response genes were found to predict with >85% accuracy relapse-free survival. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes.",

Currently DNA profiling methods only compare a suspect's DNA with DNA left at the crime scene. When there is no suspect, it would be useful for the police to be able to predict what the person of interest looks like by analysing the DNA left behind in a crime scene. Determination of the age of the suspect is an important factor in creating an identikit. Human somatic cells gradually lose telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged between 1 and 96 years old was measured using real-time quantitative PCR. Telomere length decreased with age (r=-0.185, P<0.05) and the age of an individual could be roughly determined by the following formula: (age=relative telomere length -1.5/-0.005). The regression (R(2)) value between telomere length and age was approximately 0.04, which is too low to be use for forensics. The causes for the presence of large variation in telomere lengths in the population were further investigated. The age prediction accuracies were low even after dividing samples into non-related Caucasians, males and females (5%, 9% and 1%, respectively). Mean telomere lengths of eight age groups representing each decade of life showed non-linear decrease in telomere length with age. There were variations in telomere lengths even among similarly aged individuals aged 26 years old (n=10) and age 54 years old (n=9). Therefore, telomere length measurement by real-time quantitative PCR cannot be used to predict age of a person, due to the presence of large inter-individual variations in telomere lengths.",

The emergence of new genes and functions is of central importance to the evolution of species. The contribution of various types of duplications to genetic innovation has been extensively investigated. Less understood is the creation of new genes by recycling of coding material from selfish mobile genetic elements. To investigate this process, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of SETMAR, a new primate chimeric gene resulting from fusion of a SET histone methyltransferase gene to the transposase gene of a mobile element. We show that the transposase gene was recruited as part of SETMAR 40-58 million years ago, after the insertion of an Hsmar1 transposon downstream of a preexisting SET gene, followed by the de novo exonization of previously noncoding sequence and the creation of a new intron. The original structure of the fusion gene is conserved in all anthropoid lineages, but only the N-terminal half of the transposase is evolving under strong purifying selection. In vitro assays show that this region contains a DNA-binding domain that has preserved its ancestral binding specificity for a 19-bp motif located within the terminal-inverted repeats of Hsmar1 transposons and their derivatives. The presence of these transposons in the human genome constitutes a potential reservoir of approximately 1,500 perfect or nearly perfect SETMAR-binding sites.

Five years of adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen was considered the gold-standard treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer for many years. Data from a core group of clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have challenged this perception. These studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIs in the following clinical settings: 1) as initial adjuvant therapy (the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, Breast International Group Trial 1-98), 2) in a \"switched setting\" after 2 to 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen (Arimidex-Nolvadex 95, the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group 8 [ABCSG 8] trial, the Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole study, the Intergroup Exemestane Study), and 3) in extended settings (National Cancer Institute of Canada Trial MA.17, ABCSG 6a, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project 33). The efficacy data from these studies suggested that AIs have added substantial benefit in terms of disease outcome. AIs were tolerated well, and patients who received them experienced fewer thrombolic events and less endometrial cancer, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding compared with patients who receive tamoxifen. However, patients who received tamoxifen had less skeletal events and accelerated bone resorption compared with women who received AIs. AIs should be considered when planning a patient's endocrine therapy, taking into account the differences in tolerability and end-organ effects of the classes of endocrine therapy. Outstanding issues to optimize AI therapy include identifying the optimal duration, agent, and patients for these therapies.",

Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS) are a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS).

Cytoplasmic FUS inclusions have also been identified in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-FUS). We show that a non-classical PY nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus of FUS is necessary for nuclear import. The majority of fALS-associated mutations occur within the NLS and impair nuclear import to a degree that correlates with the age of disease onset. This presents the first case of disease-causing mutations within a PY-NLS. Nuclear import of FUS is dependent on Transportin, and interference with this transport pathway leads to cytoplasmic redistribution and recruitment of FUS into stress granules. Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.",

In eukaryotes, the protein complex of Pelota (yeast Dom34) and Hbs1 translational GTPase recognizes the stalled ribosome containing the defective mRNA. Recently, we found that archaeal Pelota (aPelota) associates with archaeal elongation factor 1\u03b1 (aEF1\u03b1) to act in the mRNA surveillance pathway, which accounts for the lack of an Hbs1 ortholog in archaea. Here we present the complex structure of aPelota and GTP-bound aEF1\u03b1 determined at 2.3-\u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals how GTP-bound aEF1\u03b1 recognizes aPelota and how aPelota in turn stabilizes the GTP form of aEF1\u03b1. Combined with the functional analysis in yeast, the present results provide structural insights into the molecular interaction between eukaryotic Pelota and Hbs1. Strikingly, the aPelota\u00b7aEF1\u03b1 complex structurally resembles the tRNA\u00b7EF-Tu complex bound to the ribosome.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. RESULTS: Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

Treatment with low doses of RG7112, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of p53-MDM2, both alone and combined with pegylated interferon \u03b1 2a (Peg-IFN\u03b1 2a), significantly decreased MPN colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage and burst-forming unit-erythroid numbers and preferentially eliminated the total number of JAKV617F(+) MPN hematopoietic progenitor cells. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFN\u03b1 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis. Treatment of polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) CD34(+) cells with low doses of RG7112 and Peg-IFN\u03b1 2a before their transplantation into immune-deficient mice decreased the degree of donor-derived chimerism as well as the JAK2V617F allele burden, indicating that these drugs can each alone or in combination deplete MPN HSCs. These results provide a rationale for the use of combinations of low doses of RG7112 and Peg-IFN\u03b1 2a for the treatment of PV or PMF patients with the intent of altering their natural history.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively control expression of target genes in animals and plants. The microRNA-21 gene (mir-21) has been identified as the only miRNA commonly overexpressed in solid tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, brain, head and neck, esophagus and pancreas. We initiated a screen to identify miR-21 target genes using a reporter assay and identified a potential miR-21 target in the 3'-UTR of the programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) gene. We cloned the full-length 3'-UTR of human PDCD4 downstream of a reporter and found that mir-21 downregulated, whereas a modified antisense RNA to miR-21 upregulated reporter activity. Moreover, deletion of the putative miR-21-binding site (miRNA regulatory element, MRE) from the 3'-UTR of PDCD4, or mutations in the MRE abolished the ability of miR-21 to inhibit reporter activity, indicating that this MRE is a critical regulatory region. Western blotting showed that Pdcd4 protein levels were reduced by miR-21 in human and mouse cells, whereas quantitative real-time PCR revealed little difference at the mRNA level, suggesting translational regulation. Finally, overexpression of mir-21 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and mouse epidermal JB6 cells promoted soft agar colony formation by downregulating Pdcd4 protein levels. The demonstration that miR-21 promotes cell transformation supports the concept that mir-21 functions as an oncogene by a mechanism that involves translational repression of the tumor suppressor Pdcd4.",

While mouse sequences showed a simple gradient distribution of G + C content and CpG densities, man had a distinct peak of sequences with typical CpG island characteristics. Pairwise comparison of 23 orthologous genes revealed that mouse almost always had a less pronounced CpG island than man, or none at all. In both species the requirements for a functional CpG island may be similar in that most DNA regions with a density of six or more CpG per 100 bp remain unmethylated. However, the mouse has apparently experienced more accidental CpG island methylation, suggested by local TpG and CpA excess. We propose that: (1) in mouse the CpG islands do not represent the ancestral state but have been eroded during evolution, and (2) this erosion may be related to the mouse's small body mass and short life-span, allowing for a more relaxed control of gene activity.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of armodafinil, 150 mg, on the physiologic propensity for sleep and cognitive performance during usual night shift hours in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic (> or =3 months) shift work disorder (SWD) of moderate or greater severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 12-week, randomized controlled study was conducted at 42 sleep research facilities in North America from April 2 through December 23, 2004, and enrolled 254 permanent or rotating night shift workers with SWD. Entry criteria included excessive sleepiness during usual night shifts for 3 months or longer (corroborated by mean sleep latency of < or =6 minutes on a Multiple Sleep Latency Test), insomnia (sleep efficiency < or =87.5% during daytime sleep), and SWD that was judged clinically to be of moderate or greater severity. Patients received armodafinil, 150 mg, or placebo 30 to 60 minutes before each night shift. Physiologic sleep propensity during night shift hours, clinical impression of severity, patient-reported sleepiness, and cognitive function were assessed during laboratory night shifts at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: Armodafinil significantly improved mean (SD) sleep latency from 2.3 (1.6) minutes at baseline to 5.3 (5.0) minutes at final visit, compared with a change from 2.4 (1.6) minutes to 2.8 (2.9) minutes in the placebo group (P<.001). Clinical condition ratings improved in more patients receiving armodafinil (79%) vs placebo (59%) (P=.001). As reported by patients' diaries, armodafinil significantly reduced sleepiness during laboratory nights (P<.001), night shifts at work (P<.001), and the commute home (P=.003). Armodafinil improved performance on standardized memory (P<.001) and attention (power, P=.001; continuity, P<.001) tests compared with placebo. Armodafinil was well tolerated and did not affect daytime sleep, as measured by polysomnography. CONCLUSION: In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic SWD of moderate or greater severity, armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness during scheduled night work, raising mean nighttime sleep latency above the level considered to indicate severe sleepiness during the daytime. Armodafinil also significantly improved measures of overall clinical condition, long-term memory, and attention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00080288.",

As a consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo.

While Nox1-4 require regulatory subunits, including p22phox, Nox5 activity does not depend on any subunits. We found that inactive point mutants and truncated forms of Nox5 (including the naturally expressed splice form, Nox5S) inhibit full-length Nox5, consistent with formation of a dominant negative complex. Oligomerization of full-length Nox5 was demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation of coexpressed, differentially tagged forms of Nox5 and occurred in a manner independent of calcium ion. Several approaches were used to show that the DH domain mediates oligomerization: Nox5 could be isolated as a multimer when the calcium-binding domain and/or the N-terminal polybasic region (PBR-N) was deleted, but deletion of the DH domain eliminated oligomerization. Further, a chimera containing the transmembrane domain of Ciona intestinalis voltage sensor-containing phosphatase (CiVSP) fused to the Nox5 DH domain formed a co-immunoprecipitating complex with, and functioned as a dominant inhibitor of, full-length Nox5. Radiation inactivation of Nox5 overexpressed in HEK293 cells and endogenously expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cells indicated molecular masses of \u223c350 and \u223c300 kDa, respectively, consistent with a tetramer being the functionally active unit. Thus, Nox5 forms a catalytically active oligomer in the membrane that is mediated by its dehydrogenase domain. As a result of oligomerization, the short, calcium-independent splice form, Nox5S, may function as an endogenous inhibitor of calcium-stimulated ROS generation by full-length Nox5.",

Although intestinal epithelial cells appear to be functionally hyporesponsive to normal intestinal flora, human intestinal epithelial cells can respond to enteroinvasive bacteria and induce an inflammatory response. This initial inflammatory response leads to the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the affected site in vitro and in vivo. CARD4/NOD1 is a potential cytosolic receptor for peptidoglycan in mammalian cells that resembles pathogen-resistant proteins of plants. In this context, CARD4/NOD1 is a candidate for a recognition protein of intracellular bacteria or peptidoglycan in intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that CARD4/NOD1 is constitutively expressed in intestinal epithelial cell lines and isolated primary intestinal epithelial cells. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells. Promoter analysis of CARD4/NOD1 indicates that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding motif (-791 to -782) is essential for the effect of IFN gamma. Nuclear extracts from SW480 cells treated with IFN gamma show specific binding of oligonucleotides corresponding to this IRF-1-binding motif, which was supershifted by anti-IRF-1 antibody in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Overexpression of IRF-1 protein activates the CARD4/NOD1 promoter but not the deletion mutant of the IRF-1-binding site in a co-transfection assay of IRF-1 expression plasmid with CARD4/NOD1 promoter.

SUBJECTS: A total of 14,268 were screened; 286 depressed, employed adults (18-62 years) and 193 controls were enrolled. MEASURES: At-work limitations (presenteeism) and absenteeism were measured with the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) and WLQ Work Absence Module, respectively. Work stressors were assessed using a modified version of the Job Content Questionnaire. ANALYSIS: Univariate and multivariate tests assessed the degree to which at-work limitations were related to depression and/or stressful work. RESULTS: Presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group at each time point (p < or = .001). In cross-sectional models, presenteeism was associated with more severe depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, the interaction ofpsychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r2 range = .33-.54). Absences were explained by depression symptom severity and poorer general physical health but not work stressors (r2 = .19). Because of minimal change in the work stressors, their longitudinal effects on outcomes were mostly nonsignificant.

Several PTM target residues and their corresponding modifying enzymes have been discovered in human and nonhuman desmin. The major effect of phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation is the disassembly of desmin filaments, while ubiquitylation of desmin leads to its degradation. The regulation of the desmin filament network by phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation was found to be implicated in several major biological processes such as myogenesis, myoblast fusion, muscle contraction, muscle atrophy, cell division and possibly desmin interactions with its binding partners. Phosphorylation of desmin is also implicated in many forms of desmin-related myopathies (desminopathies). In this review, we summarize the findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the study of desminopathies.

Furthermore, zyxin accumulation at force-bearing sites requires the LIM domain located at the C-terminus of zyxin. The zyxin LIM domain consists of three LIM motifs, each containing two zinc-binding sites. Since individual LIM motifs do not accumulate at focal adhesions or force-bearing sites, we hypothesize that multiple zyxin LIM domains increase force sensitivity. Using a miniature force sensor and GFP-tagged LIM variants, we quantified the relationship between single, tandem dimer and trimer LIM protein localization and traction forces. While the presence of extra LIM domains affected VASP recruitment to focal adhesions, force sensitivity was not enhanced over the single LIM domain. Therefore, zyxin force sensitivity is optimal with a single LIM domain, while additional LIM domains fail to enhance force sensitivity.",

Traditionally, warfarin has been the drug of choice and, indeed, this drug is effective and provides a more than 60% reduction in stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, OAT entails an increased bleeding risk, and management of this is challenging. Among other things, new oral anticoagulant drugs offer fixed dosing, more predictable pharmacokinetics and fewer interactions with drugs and food. Moreover, these drugs seem to provide an improved benefit-risk ratio with respect to thromboembolic events and bleeding complications in a broad patient population. The new drugs differ from traditional OAT with respect to their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, especially with respect to elimination through the kidneys. These drugs may potentially cause bleeding complications in patients with reduced drug excretion due to impaired renal function. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. Pharmacokinetic studies and data from clinical studies have provided information on how to guide dosing in patients with renal impairment. However, the risk of drug accumulation and bleeding may be amplified by several drug-drug interactions. This article provides a review of the literature on the pharmacology of new anticoagulant drugs with particular focus on the impact of impaired renal function.",

They account for over one third of all primary central nervous system tumors in adults and confer a significant risk of location-dependent morbidity due to compression or displacement. A significant increase in risk of meningiomas is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) disease through mutation of the NF2 gene. In addition, approximately 5% of individuals with schwannomatosis disease develop meningiomas, through mutation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, SMARCB1. Recently, a second SWI/SNF complex subunit, SMARCE1, was identified as a cause of clear cell meningiomas, indicating a wider role for this complex in meningioma disease. The sonic hedgehog (SHH)-GLI1 signaling pathway gene, SUFU, has also been identified as the cause of hereditary multiple meningiomas in a large Finnish family. The recent identification of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas.

CD40 is critically involved in Fas-mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis during liver inflammation, but the underlying signalling events are poorly understood. Our recent work implicated AP-1 in CD40-induced cholangiocyte apoptosis, but suggested involvement of other signalling pathways. Because STAT3 has been implicated in liver regeneration we investigated this signalling pathway during CD40 mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis. Western immunoblotting, electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays, In situ DNA end labelling and caspase-3 activity were used to investigate intracellular signalling and apoptosis in primary human cholangiocytes following CD40 activation. CD40-activation induced caspase-3 dependent cholangiocyte apoptosis and 3-fold increases in JNK/ERK phosphorylation (concomitant with increased AP-1 binding activity) and 4-fold increases in pSTAT3, which were sustained for up to 24 h. Protein levels of c-Jun, c-Fos and pSTAT3 confirmed the upregulation. Phosphorylation of p38 remained unchanged suggesting that this MAP kinase was not involved in CD40 mediated apoptosis. Increased JAK2 phosphorylation accompanied increased STAT3 phosphorylation after CD40 ligation. Cholangiocytes were also shown to express JAK1 and 3 which was phosphorylated following control stimulation with TNFalpha or IL2 respectively but not after CD40 ligation. JNK, ERK and JAK2 inhibitors partially abrogated apoptosis and when used in combination reduced it to basal levels. In conclusion, induction of CD40-mediated cholangiocyte apoptosis requires JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as sustained JNK1/2, ERK1/2 activation. This study demonstrates that STAT3 can function as a proapoptotic factor in primary human liver epithelial cells.",

BACKGROUND: In an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder. METHODS: Adult outpatients with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) total score > 20 were randomly assigned to receive placebo or desvenlafaxine (10 or 50 mg/day) after a 6- to 14-day single-blind placebo lead-in period in an 8-week, phase 3, fixed-dose trial. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the HAM-D(17) score analyzed using analysis of covariance. Efficacy analyses were conducted with the intent-to-treat population, using the last observation carried forward. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 673 patients. Change from baseline to final evaluation in adjusted HAM-D(17) total scores was not significantly different comparing desvenlafaxine 10 mg/day (-9.28) and desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (-8.92) with placebo (-8.42). There were no differences among treatment groups in the rates of treatment response or remission. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 1.8%, 0.9%, and 1.8% of patients in the placebo and desvenlafaxine 10- and 50-mg/day groups, respectively. Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Both doses of desvenlafaxine failed to separate from placebo. However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo. Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

Further directions in the surgical treatment of OCD will require better preoperative predictors of postoperative responses, optimal selection of individualized targets, and rigorous reporting of adverse events and standardized outcomes.

Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is complicated by B-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients. Several clinical and serological features are proposed as adverse predictors for such complication and define a high risk pSS phenotype. We aimed to explore whether previously described polymorphisms of the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) could be related to pSS-related lymphomagenesis. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the BAFF gene (rs1224141, rs12583006, rs9514828, rs1041569 and the rs9514827) were evaluated in 111 low risk pSS patients (type II), 82 high risk/lymphoma patients (type I) and 137 healthy controls (HC) by PCR-based assays. The classification of pSS patients into types I and II was based on the presence or absence of risk factors or lymphoma development, respectively. Genotype and haplotype analysis was performed for all variants in the pSS groups. Since the rs1041569 SNP was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the HC group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), haplotype analysis was performed in the remaining four out of the five SNPs tested when comparisons with HC individuals were performed. The high risk pSS group was characterized by higher frequency of the minor T allele of the rs9514828 BAFF polymorphism compared to HC. Compared to the low risk pSS patients but not the HC, the high risk pSS group exhibited lower frequencies of the AA genotype of the rs12583006 polymorphism as well as the TACAC and TACC haplotypes and higher frequency of the TTTC haplotype. The low risk pSS group exhibited higher frequency of the minor A allele and AA genotype of the rs12583006 variant compared to HC. Both pSS groups were characterized by increased frequency of the haplotype TATT and GTTC and decreased frequency of the TTCT when compared to HC. Taken together, these findings suggest the implication of the host's genetic background in pSS-related lymphomagenesis. The interaction of pSS-related BAFF gene haplotypes together with distinct BAFF genetic variants appears to contribute to this complication.",

HDAC6, a class IIb deacetylase, plays an essential role in tumorigenesis and cell stress response. HSPs, HSF1 and HDAC6 are up-regulated in cancer. In the present study, we explored the effect of curcumin, a phytochemical, on HSPs (27, 70, 90), HSF1 and HDAC6 in two different leukemia cell lines (K-562 and HL-60). The association between HDAC6, HSPs, and intrinsic oxidative stress was also investigated. Overexpression of HSPs (27, 70, 90), HSF1, and HDAC6 in leukemia cells were down-regulated by curcumin, and the effects on HSPs 27and 70 were less than that on HSP 90. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, leading to apoptosis. Different cell cycle regulatory proteins (p53, p21, cyclin B1, CDK1, Cdc25C) and some apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, Bad, Apaf1, AIF and Cyt c) were altered by curcumin.

BACKGROUND: Amifostine (WR-2721, delivered as Ethyol) is a phosphorylated aminothiol compound clinically used in addition to cis-platinum to reduce the toxic side effects of therapeutic treatment on normal cells without reducing their efficacy on tumour cells. Its mechanism of action is attributed to the free radical scavenging properties of its active dephosphorylated metabolite WR-1065. However, amifostine has also been described as a potent hypoxia-mimetic compound and as a strong p53 inducer; both effects are known to potently modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) expression. The angiogenic properties of this drug have not been clearly defined. METHODS: Cancer cell lines and endothelial cells were used in culture and treated with Amifostine in order to study (i) the expression of angiogenesis related genes and proteins and (ii) the effects of the drug on VEGF-A induced in vitro angiogenesis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the treatment of several human cancer cell lines with therapeutical doses of WR-1065 led to a strong induction of different VEGF-A mRNA isoforms independently of HIF-1alpha. VEGF-A induction by WR-1065 depends on the activation of the eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway. This up-regulation of VEGF-A mRNA was accompanied by an increased secretion of VEGF-A proteins fully active in stimulating vascular endothelial cells (EC). Nevertheless, direct treatment of EC with amifostine impaired their ability to respond to exogenous VEGF-A, an effect that correlated to the down-regulation of VEGFR-2 expression, to the reduction in cell surface binding of VEGF-A and to the decreased phosphorylation of the downstream p42/44 kinases. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that amifostine treatment modulates tumour angiogenesis by two apparently opposite mechanisms - the increased VEGF-A expression by tumour cells and the inhibition of EC capacity to respond to VEGF-A stimulation.",

BORIS, like other members of the 'cancer/testis antigen' family, is normally expressed in testicular germ cells and repressed in somatic cells, but is aberrantly activated in cancers. To understand regulatory mechanisms governing human BORIS expression, we characterized its 5'-flanking region. Using 5' RACE, we identified three promoters, designated A, B and C, corresponding to transcription start sites at -1447, -899 and -658 bp upstream of the first ATG. Alternative promoter usage generated at least five alternatively spliced BORIS mRNAs with different half-lives determined by varying 5'-UTRs. In normal testis, BORIS is transcribed from all three promoters, but 84% of the 30 cancer cell lines tested used only promoter(s) A and/or C while the others utilized primarily promoters B and C. The differences in promoter usage between normal and cancer cells suggested that they were subject to differential regulation. We found that DNA methylation and functional p53 contributes to the negative regulation of each promoter. Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related associations between haploinsufficiency of CTCF and BORIS derepression, and between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of BORIS.",

BACKGROUND: Although triiodothyronine deficiency has been described after cardiopulmonary bypass, data supporting its use have been conflicting. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to further define the effect of triiodothyronine on hemodynamics and outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: A total of 170 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were enrolled and completed the study from November 1996 through March 1998. On removal of the aortic crossclamp, patients were randomized to receive either intravenous triiodothyronine (0.4 microgram/kg bolus plus 0.1 microgram/kg infusion administered over a 6-hour period, n = 81) or placebo (n = 89). Outcome variables included hemodynamic profile and inotropic drug/pressor requirements at several time points (mean +/- standard error of the mean), perioperative morbidity (arrhythmia/ischemia/infarction), and mortality. RESULTS: Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients randomized to triiodothyronine had a higher cardiac index and lower inotropic requirements after the operation. Subjects receiving triiodothyronine demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, P =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, P =.013). Seven patients in the placebo group required postoperative mechanical assistance (intra-aortic balloon pump, n = 4; left ventricular assist device, n = 3), compared with none in the triiodothyronine group (P =.01). There were 2 deaths in the placebo group and no deaths in the triiodothyronine group. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for postoperative pacemaker support was reduced.",

This study was designed to evaluate the changes of Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation during breast cancer progression from normal to pre-invasive lesions and invasive breast cancer (IBC), and their relationship with characteristics of IBC. We analyzed the methylation status of Alu and LINE-1 in 145 cases of breast samples including normal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia/flat epithelial atypia (ADH/FEA), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC, and another set of 129 cases of IBC by pyrosequencing. Alu methylation showed no significant changes during multistep progression of breast cancer, although it tended to decrease during the transition from DCIS to IBC. In contrast, LINE-1 methylation significantly decreased from normal to ADH/FEA, while it was similar in ADH/FEA, DCIS and IBC. In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, and LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with negative ER status, ERBB2 (HER2) amplification and p53 overexpression. Alu and LINE-1 methylation status was significantly different between breast cancer subtypes, and the HER2 enriched subtype had lowest methylation levels. In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients.

          "context": "Thermogenesis in brown adipocytes is inhibited by volatile anesthetic agents. A factor contributing to hypothermia in infants? BACKGROUND: In infants, nonshivering thermogenesis from brown adipose tissue provides an important source of heat for thermoregulation. Infants are known to have a high susceptibility to hypothermia during anesthesia. To investigate whether this could be due to an inhibition of nonshivering thermogenesis by anesthetics, the effect of preincubation with volatile anesthetics on the norepinephrine-induced heat production of brown adipocytes was investigated. METHODS: Brown adipocytes from hamsters were isolated with a collagenase digestion method and preincubated with volatile anesthetics. The cells were stimulated with norepinephrine, and heat production, measured as oxygen consumption, was monitored polarographically. RESULTS: Norepinephrine addition led to a 20-fold increase in the rate of oxygen consumption (thermogenesis). However, preincubation of cells with 3% halothane reduced the response to norepinephrine by more than 70%. The potency of norepinephrine (the median effective concentration) was not affected by halothane. Full effect of halothane was reached quickly, and after halothane withdrawal, the thermogenic response recovered, although rather slowly. Halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane were approximately equipotent inhibitors of thermogenesis, with concentrations of approximately 0.7% resulting in 50% inhibition. The inhibitory effect of 1% halothane was unaffected by the presence of 74% nitrous oxide, but nitrous oxide alone also reduced thermogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Volatile anesthetics severely attenuated the thermogenic response to norepinephrine of isolated brown-fat cells. It is inferred that brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some time after) anesthesia. Because infants are dependent on brown-fat-derived nonshivering thermogenesis for thermal balance, the inhibition by volatile anesthetic agents of brown-adipocyte heat production may at least partly explain the susceptibility of infants to hypothermia during and after anesthesia.",

Aberrant expression and activation of EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) have been successfully targeted for cancer therapeutics. Recent evidence from both basic and clinical studies suggests that ERBB3 (HER3) serves as a key activator of downstream signaling through dimerization with other ERBB proteins and plays a critical role in the widespread clinical resistance to EGFR and HER2 targeting cancer therapies. As a result, HER3 is actively pursued as an antibody therapeutic target for cancer. Ligand binding is thought to be a prerequisite for dimerization of HER3 with other ERBB proteins, which results in phosphorylation of its c-terminal tyrosine residues and activation of downstream AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. In this study, we report that an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (HER2Mab), which blocks HER2 dimerization with HER3, induces HER3 dimerization with EGFR in both low and high HER2 expressing cancer cells. Treatment of the low HER2 expressing MCF7 cancer cells with HER2Mab promoted cell proliferation and migration in the absence of HER3 ligand stimulation. Follow-up studies revealed that HER2Mab-induced HER3 signaling via EGFR/HER3 dimerization and activation of downstream AKT signaling pathways. These results suggest that equilibrium of dimerization among the ERBB proteins can be perturbed by HER2Mab and HER3 plays a key role in sensing the perturbation.",

The diaphragm, the main muscle of inspiration, is constantly subjected to mechanical loading. One of the very few occasions during which diaphragm loading is arrested is during controlled mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Recent animal studies indicate that the diaphragm is extremely sensitive to unloading, causing rapid muscle fiber atrophy: unloading-induced diaphragm atrophy and the concomitant diaphragm weakness has been suggested to contribute to the difficulties in weaning patients from ventilatory support. Little is known about the molecular triggers that initiate the rapid unloading atrophy of the diaphragm, although proteolytic pathways and oxidative signaling have been shown to be involved. Mechanical stress is known to play an important role in the maintenance of muscle mass. Within the muscle's sarcomere titin is considered to play an important role in the stress-response machinery. Titin is the largest protein known to date and acts as a mechanosensor that regulates muscle protein expression in a sarcomere strain-dependent fashion. Thus, titin is an attractive candidate for sensing the sudden mechanical arrest of the diaphragm when patients are mechanically ventilated, leading to changes in muscle protein expression. Here, we provide a novel perspective on how titin, and its biomechanical sensing and signaling, might be involved in the development of mechanical unloading-induced diaphragm weakness.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of preoperative phone counseling by junior medical staff for improving the standard of informed consent for tonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. SETTING: District general hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 43 patients undergoing tonsillectomy were randomly allocated to 2 groups. Group A (n = 25) underwent the conventional consent process by the consultant ear, nose, and throat surgeon at the time of assessment (which generally takes place 6 to 12 months prior to surgery due to wait-list times). Group B (n = 18) underwent this same consent process but received a structured preoperative phone call 2 to 3 weeks prior to the day of surgery. A preoperative questionnaire assessing the knowledge of tonsillectomy, perioperative course, and risks was completed on the day of surgery. RESULTS: Group B had a better recall of the risks of tonsillectomy, recalling 7.1 of the 10 most significant risks, as compared with 4.6 for group A (P = .017). Group B had a better awareness of tooth damage (78% vs 30% of patients, P < .001), voice change (61 vs 19%, P = .005), and burns to lips and mouth (44% vs 8%, P = .005). Finally, 35% more patients from group B rated their understanding of tonsillectomy as good or very good (P = .017).

The patient presented with a left supraclavicular abscess and a non-cavitary, left lung mass encasing a pulmonary vein. Incision and drainage of the patient's subcutaneous abscess isolated B. pseudomallei, and fine-needle aspiration of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes revealed the presence of intracellular gram-negative bacilli with no evidence of malignancy. Biochemical tests determined that the strain the patient acquired from Mexico is identical to only 1 other isolate from Thailand.

Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. To elucidate the mechanism underlying Gfi1b function, potential downstream transcriptional targets were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling approaches. The combination of these approaches revealed the oncogene meis1, which encodes a homeobox protein, as a direct and prominent target of Gfi1b. Examination of the meis1 promoter sequence revealed multiple Gfi1/1b consensus binding motifs. Distinct regions of the promoter were occupied by Gfi1b and its cofactors LSD1 and CoREST/Rcor1, in erythroid cells but not in the closely related megakaryocyte lineage. Accordingly, Meis1 was significantly upregulated in LSD1 inhibited erythroid cells, but not in megakaryocytes. This lineage specific upregulation in Meis1 expression was accompanied by a parallel increase in di-methyl histone3 lysine4 levels in the Meis1 promoter in LSD1 inhibited, erythroid cells. Meis1 was also substantially upregulated in gfi1b-/- fetal liver cells along with its transcriptional partners Pbx1 and several Hox messages. Elevated Meis1 message levels persisted in gfi1b mutant fetal liver cells differentiated along the erythroid lineage, relative to wild type. However, cells differentiated along the megakaryocytic lineage, exhibited no difference in Meis1 levels between controls and mutants. Transfection experiments further demonstrated specific repression of meis1 promoter driven reporters by wild type Gfi1b but neither by a SNAG domain mutant nor by a DNA binding deficient one, thus confirming direct functional regulation of this promoter by the Gfi1b transcriptional complex. Overall, our results demonstrate direct yet differential regulation of meis1 transcription by Gfi1b in distinct hematopoietic lineages thus revealing it to be a common, albeit lineage specific, target of both Gfi1b and its paralog Gfi1.",

This mutant displayed a similar level of cross-resistance to etoposide (VP-16) and other topoisomerase II (topo II) inhibitors. Further analysis of the phenotype revealed a broad cross-resistance to vinca alkaloids, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, aphidicolin and UV light. Low-level expression of mdr1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as well as a modest impairment of cellular drug accumulation and partial reversion of resistance to DOX and VP-16 by cyclosporine, confirmed a moderate role of P-gp in conferring drug resistance in P388/SPR cells. Consistent changes in neither topo II expression or activity nor glutathione metabolism could be detected. Induction of apoptosis was significantly reduced in P388/SPR cells, as indicated by minimal DNA fragmentation. Analysis of oncogenes regulating apoptotic cell death revealed a marked decrease of bcl-2 in combination with a moderate reduction of bax protein, but a striking overexpression of the long form of the bcl-X protein. Transfection of human bcl-X-L into P388 cells conferred drug resistance similar to that of P388/SPR cells.

Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear. One of these genes is C15orf2, which has no orthologues in rodents, but appears to be under strong positive selection in primates. C15orf2 encodes a 1156 amino acid protein with six nuclear localisation sequences. By protein BLAST analysis and InterProScan signature recognition search, we found sequence similarity of C15orf2 to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein POM121. To determine whether C15orf2 is located at nuclear pores, we generated a stable cell line that inducibly expresses FLAG-tagged C15orf2 and performed immunocytochemical studies. We found that C15orf2 is present at the nuclear periphery, where it colocalizes with NPCs and nuclear lamins. At very high expression levels, we observed invaginations of the nuclear envelope. Extending these observations to three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, which achieves an 8-fold improved volumetric resolution over conventional imaging, we saw that C15orf2 is located at the inner face of the nuclear envelope where it strongly associates with the NPC. In nuclear envelope isolation and fractionation experiments, we detected C15orf2 in the NPC and lamina fractions. These experiments for the first time demonstrate that C15orf2 is part of the NPC or its associated molecular networks.

METHODS: Seventy-six adults (mean age 54.6 years; 71% women; 92% Caucasian) were included in this comparative matched-cohort study of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage on the basis of computed tomography (CT) findings. Thirty-eight patients who received continuous MgSO4 infusion were matched for age, race, sex, treatment option, Fisher grade, and Hunt and Hess grade to 38 historical control individuals who did not receive MgSO4infusion.

In addition, practically all patients were gracile and had thin extremities. Other findings included a peculiar high-pitched voice (96%), yellowish dots in ocular fundi (79%), cutaneous naevi flammei (65%), hepatomegaly (45%), and fibrous dysplasia of long bones (25%). Mild muscular hypotonicity (68%) was the only neurological abnormality. The clinical features of the Finnish patients with MUL formed a distinct entity. The most consistent findings were growth failure and characteristic craniofacial features. However, organ manifestations varied considerably in early childhood. Based on these findings, we propose new diagnostic criteria for MUL.",

Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Calcium overload and spontaneous calcium release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum are regarded as possible initiations of early and delayed afterdepolarization thereby triggering ventricular arrhythmias. In chronic heart failure, calcium overload is more likely to occur compared with healthy hearts, which is one explantation for the increased vulnerability in this condition. L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium-exchanger (NCX), and ryanodine receptor are crucial for calcium homeostasis and therefore represent potential targets for antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Experimental studies have proven beneficial effects for all these three mechanisms in prevention and suppression of tachyarrhythmias. However, clinical data is mainly available for the L-type calcium channel inhibitor verapamil. Therefore, it is still a long way to clinical employment of drugs modifying cellular calcium handling for antiarrhythmic therapy.",

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that magnesium has neuroprotective and vasodilatation properties. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of intravenous magnesium therapy in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). RESEARCH DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched for prospective controlled trials evaluating intravenous magnesium for treating SAH after a ruptured aneurysm without language restrictions. Two researchers performed the literature search and data extraction independently. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Six prospective controlled trials involving 699 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the meta-analysis. The withdrawal rate for adverse effects was higher in the magnesium-treatment arm compared to the placebo arm, RR 9.98 (95% CI 3.04-32.74). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH. Serum magnesium should be routinely monitored for both effectiveness and safety considerations.",

Although an increasing number of HSCR-associated RET coding sequence (CDS) mutations have been identified in recent years, not many have been investigated for functional consequence on the RET protein. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the functional implications of the de novo RET-CDS mutations V145G, Y483X, V636fsX1, and F961L that we first identified in sporadic Chinese patients with HSCR. The V145G disrupted RET glycosylation and F961L RET phosphorylation. Presumably, the truncation mutations would affect the translocation or the anchoring of the RET protein onto the cellular membrane.

The exact mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown, limiting the identification of effective disease-modifying therapies. The two principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), peptide deposition (senile plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. During the last decade, most of the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry were directed against the production and accumulation of A\u03b2. The most innovative of the pharmacological approaches was the stimulation of A\u03b2 clearance from the brain of AD patients via the administration of A\u03b2 antigens (active vaccination) or anti-A\u03b2 antibodies (passive vaccination). Several active and passive anti-A\u03b2 vaccines are under clinical investigation. Unfortunately, the first active vaccine (AN1792, consisting of preaggregate A\u03b2 and an immune adjuvant, QS-21) was abandoned because it caused meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of treated patients. Anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (bapineuzumab and solanezumab) are now being developed. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E \u03b54 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the A\u03b2 peptide. Solanezumab, a humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody directed against the midregion of the A\u03b2 peptide, was shown to neutralize soluble A\u03b2 species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile of solanezumab, while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. Although some studies suggested that active immunization may be effective against tau in animal models of AD, very few studies regarding passive immunization against tau protein are currently available. The results of the large, ongoing Phase III trials with bapineuzumab and solanezumab will tell us if monoclonal anti-A\u03b2 antibodies may slow down the rate of deterioration of AD. Based on the new diagnostic criteria of AD and on recent major failures of anti-A\u03b2 drugs in mild-to-moderate AD patients, one could argue that clinical trials on potential disease-modifying drugs, including immunological approaches, should be performed in the early stages of AD.",

BACKGROUND: Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. This creates a problem for insurers that cover medication costs, because treatment of acne is often covered but treatment of photoaging is not. The age distributions of patients with acne or photoaging are likely to be very different. Therefore, one approach insurers can use is an age cutoff for covering the cost of topical tretinoin therapy. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine at what age patients are more likely to receive tretinoin for treatment of acne vulgaris versus other conditions to provide a rational basis for insurers to set coverage cutoffs. METHODS: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for the years 1990 to 1994 were analyzed to ascertain the age distribution of acne vulgaris office visits and treatment with topical acne agents including tretinoin. These data were compared to office visits and tretinoin treatment of wrinkles, solar elastosis, and other conditions. RESULTS: The mean age (+/- standard deviation) of patients seen for acne vulgaris was 24.3 +/-11.5 years old. The age distribution of topical tretinoin treatment paralleled the age distribution of acne. Tretinoin treatment of acne and of nonacne conditions were equal at an age of 44. CONCLUSION: The distribution of outpatient visits for acne treatment is skewed toward older patients and persists beyond age 40. A rational age cut-off for coverage of topical tretinoin treatment is 40 years.",

In this open trial, patients were treated for one cycle with placebo and then for three consecutive cycles with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. The study population was composed of 14 participants who met DSM-IV criteria for PDD with moderate to severe symptomatology and specifically endorsed anger and irritability as a central premenstrual complaint. Patients showed modest improvement over the course of the pretreatment evaluation, with significant improvement occurring for feelings of worthlessness, decreased interest, and low energy. The effects of active treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14.9 (+/- 5.3) to 8.2 (+/- 4.9) in the first, 7.8 (+/- 5.1) in the second, and 7.8 (+/- 6.8) in the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17.6; p < 0.0001).

Vascular endothelial cells regulate vascular smooth muscle tone through Ca2+-dependent production and release of vasoactive molecules. Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles. In the present study, we report the existence of PLB in the vascular endothelium, a nonmuscle tissue, and provide functional data on PLB regulation of vascular contractility through its actions in the endothelium. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was attenuated in aorta of PLB-deficient (PLB-KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) controls. This effect was not due to actions of nitric oxide on the smooth muscle, because sodium nitroprusside-mediated relaxation in either denuded or endothelium-intact aortas was unaffected by PLB ablation. Relative to denuded vessels, relaxation to forskolin was enhanced in WT endothelium-intact aortas. The endothelium-dependent component of this relaxation was attenuated in PLB-KO aortas. To investigate whether these changes were due to PLB, WT mouse aorta endothelial cells were isolated. Both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed the presence of PLB in endothelial cells, which were shown to be >98% pure by diI-acetylated LDL uptake and nuclear counterstaining. These data indicate that PLB is present and modulates vascular function as a result of its actions in endothelial cells. The presence of PLB in endothelial cells opens new fields for investigation of Ca2+ regulatory pathways in nonmuscle cells and for modulation of endothelial-vascular interactions.",

In the last decade there have been considerable advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VA) and Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD). Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT). Each of these syndromes includes multiple subtypes with different and sometimes complex genetic abnormalities of cardiac ion channels. Many are associated with other somatic and neurological abnormalities besides the risk of VA and SCD. The current management of cardiac ion channelopathy could be summarized as follows: 1) in symptomatic patients, the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the only viable option; 2) in asymptomatic patients, risk stratification is necessary followed by the ICD, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both. A genotype-specific approach to pharmacotherapy requires a thorough understanding of the molecular-cellular basis of arrhythmogenesis in cardiac ion channelopathies as well as the specific drug profile.",

These data demonstrate the utility of IQSCMaRTEA for evaluating drugs that bypass nonsense mutations.

Urogenital infections are the most frequently encountered adverse events, although tend to be mild to moderate and are easily manageable with standard treatment. Although no increased acute kidney injury risk was evident in the major trials, the mechanism of action of these drugs requires caution when they are administered in patients with extracellular volume depletion or with drugs affecting renal hemodynamics. Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Regarding other adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia even when co-administered with insulin, but a decrease in the dose of sulphonylureas may be needed. The available data do not point to a causative role of SGLT2 inhibitors on malignancy risk, however, these drugs should be used with caution in patients with known hematuria or history of bladder cancer. SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be safe and effective in the treatment of diabetes but more studies are required to assess their long-term safety.",

Single-nucleotide substitutions are a defining characteristic of cancer genomes. Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes. Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features. Furthermore, some substitution signatures are more frequent in certain DNA replication timing zones. Finally, integrating data on higher-order nuclear organization, we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves. These data suggest that DNA replication timing together with higher-order genomic organization contribute to the patterns of single-nucleotide substitution in normal and cancer genomes.",

The human genome is rich in sequences which are structurally related to the 7SL RNA component of the signal recognition particle. The 7SL DNA sequence family consists of four 7SL genes, 500 7SL pseudogenes (which are truncated at one or both ends of the 7SL sequence) and 500,000 Alu sequences. Both 7SL genes and Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene. Why then does RNA polymerase III transcribe the few 7SL genes so efficiently, while transcripts from the far more abundant Alu elements are not readily detectable? We find that a human 7SL gene and a synthetic Alu sequence derived from it are expressed 50-100-fold more efficiently in vitro than either a representative Alu element or two 7SL pseudogenes. 5' Deletion and insertion mutants of the 7SL gene demonstrate that, in conjunction with the internal promoter, the first 37 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are essential for efficient and accurate initiation in vitro. We suggest that the genomic sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be transcribed in vivo. This may help to explain the homogeneity of the Alu family within each mammalian genome, as well as the species-specific differences between mammalian Alu families.",

Aberrant epigenetic regulation has recently been implicated in the downregulation of tumour suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs). Histone modification and DNA methylation can have different roles in gene silencing in cancer. To investigate whether histone modifications would contribute to the dysregulation of miRNAs in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the effect of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), on miRNA expression profile was analysed by microarray assay in a precursor B-cell ALL cell line NALM-6. A total of 10 miRNAs were downregulated and 31 were upregulated significantly following TSA treatment. Among TSA-upregulated miRNAs, MIR22 is an extronic miRNA and resides in the second exon of the non-coding transcript MGC14376. Upregulation of MIR22 transcription was found in both NALM-6 cells and primary human ALL malignant cells treated with TSA. Whereas a CpG island was identified within the promoter element of MIR22, no promoter DNA methylation was detected in these cells. In contrast, accumulation of the repressive histone marker H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27triM) was identified around the transcriptional start point of the gene, which was reduced by TSA treatment. Thus, accumulation of H3K27triM independent of promoter DNA methylation may be a novel epigenetic mechanism for MIR22 silencing in ALL.",

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported to play an important role in apoptotic cell death of human malignancies. The aim of this study was to delineate the mechanism of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cell survival. We first analyzed the endogenous expression and subcellular localization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in six PaCa cell lines by Western blot. To delineate the functional role of Bcl-2 family proteins, siRNA-mediated knock-down of protein expression was used. Apoptosis was measured by Cell Death ELISA and Hoechst 33258 staining. In the results, the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins varied between PaCa cell lines. Mcl-1 knock-down resulted in marked cleavage of PARP and induction of apoptosis. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL had a much weaker effect. Simultaneous knock-down of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 strongly induced apoptosis, but simultaneous knock-down of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 or Mcl-1/Bcl-2 had no additive effect. The apoptosis-inducing effect of simultaneous knock-down of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 was associated with translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation.

IMPORTANCE: Propranolol therapy is changing the treatment paradigm for infantile hemangioma. This study addresses the effect of propranolol therapy on the treatment of nasal infantile hemangioma (NIH), an area that often does not respond to medical therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine if propranolol treatment is associated with fewer invasive treatments for NIH. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study conducted within a single pediatric institution's multidisciplinary vascular anomaly program for patients with NIH treated between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2011. Three NIH cohorts were compared: prepropranolol (20 in group 1; 2003-2009), propranolol (25 in group 2; 2009-2011), and nonpropranolol (13 in group 3; 2009-2011) treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Analysis of systemic medical, laser, or surgical therapies for NIH. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study plan was created to detect a change in invasive therapy for NIH. Data collected included presenting age, sex, affected nasal subunits, infantile hemangioma morphologic characteristics, treatment type and number, and primary treating service. An NIH grading system, based on nasal subunit involvement, helped quantify treatment change. Descriptive statistics summarized data, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluated propranolol use and the likelihood of invasive treatments (surgical excision or laser). RESULTS: Of the 95 patients identified, 58 met inclusion criteria: 20 in group 1 (mean age, 4.8 months), 25 in group 2 (mean age, 4.9 months), and 13 in group 3 (mean age, 4.9 months). Nasal infantile hemangiomas involved the nasal tip subunit in 33 of 58 patients (56.9%). Eight of 13 patients (61.5%) in group 3 frequently had small NIH (grade 1). Patients in group 2 were less likely to undergo any invasive treatments (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.73), have surgical excision only (0.45; 0.15-1.38), or undergo laser treatment only (0.44; 0.27-0.78) compared with those in group 1. Patients with higher-grade NIH had more medical or invasive therapy, but invasive procedures were carried out in each subgroup defined by grade. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with isolated propranolol-treated NIH were less likely to undergo invasive treatment, but despite its implementation, the need for invasive treatment was not totally supplanted by its use.",

We investigated the migration of multiple nuclei in hyphae of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii.

These movements were superimposed on a cMT-independent mode of nuclear migration, cotransport with the cytoplasmic stream. This latter mode is sufficient to support wild-type-like hyphal growth speeds. cMT-dependent nuclear movements were led by a nuclear-associated microtubule-organizing center, the spindle pole body (SPB), which is the sole site of microtubule nucleation in A. gossypii. Analysis of A. gossypii SPBs by electron microscopy revealed an overall laminar structure similar to the budding yeast SPB but with distinct differences at the cytoplasmic side. Up to six perpendicular and tangential cMTs emanated from a more spherical outer plaque. The perpendicular and tangential cMTs most likely correspond to short, often cortex-associated cMTs and to long, hyphal growth-axis-oriented cMTs, respectively, seen by in vivo imaging. Each SPB nucleates its own array of cMTs, and the lack of overlapping cMT arrays between neighboring nuclei explains the autonomous nuclear oscillations and bypassing observed in A. gossypii hyphae.",

OBJECTIVE: A new formulation of propofol 6% in Lipofundin MCT/LCT 10% (propofol 6% SAZN) has been developed in order to reduce the fat, emulsifier and volume load that is given during prolonged infusions of propofol. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety characteristics of propofol 6% SAZN were investigated during a short-term infusion and compared with the commercially available product propofol 1% in Intralipid 10% (Diprivan-10) and propofol 1% in Lipofundin MCT/LCT 10% (propofol 1% SAZN). METHODS: In a randomised double-blind study, 24 male patients received a 5-h infusion of propofol at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h for sedation in the immediate postoperative period following coronary artery bypass surgery. RESULTS: The average pharmacokinetic parameter estimates of clearance (Cl), volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss), elimination half-life (t1/2,beta) and distribution half-life (t1/2,alpha) observed in the three groups were 28 +/- 1.1 ml/kg/min, 1.8 +/- 0.12 l/kg, 94 +/- 4.1 min and 3.1 +/- 0.26 min, respectively (mean +/- SEM, n = 24) and no significant differences were noted between the three formulations (P > 0.05). In one patient receiving propofol 6% SAZN, in two patients receiving propofol 1% SAZN and in three patients receiving Diprivan-10, the level of sedation was inadequate and additional sedative medication had to be given. In all other 18 patients, the level of sedation was adequate. The mean propofol concentration in these six inadequately sedated patients was lower than the adequately sedated patients (P = 0.015). The serum triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different between the groups studied. No adverse events occurred in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety characteristics of propofol 6% SAZN are in good agreement with those of the 1% formulations. Propofol 6% SAZN therefore provides a useful alternative to the commercially available 1% formulation for short-term sedation in the intensive care unit. Expected advantages in long-term sedation of the 6% over 1% formulation are the subject of an ongoing study.",

Using viral genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (3C) methods, we now show that KSHV latency control region is physically linked to the promoter regulatory region for ORF50, which encodes the KSHV immediate early protein RTA. Other linkages were also observed, including an interaction between the 5' and 3' end of the latency transcription cluster. Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control. siRNA depletion of CTCF or cohesin subunits also disrupted chromosomal linkages and deregulated viral latent and lytic gene transcription. Furthermore, the linkage between the latent and lytic control region was subject to cell cycle fluctuation and disrupted during lytic cycle reactivation, suggesting that these interactions are dynamic and regulatory. Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control.",

We have recently shown that during melioidosis, a severe infection caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, TLR2 but not TLR4 impacts the immune response of the intact host in vivo. METHODS: The function of CD14 in melioidosis was analyzed by means of in vitro and in vivo approaches, using wild-type (WT) and CD14 knockout (KO) mice. RESULTS: CD14-deficient macrophages and whole blood leukocytes released less tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on stimulation with B. pseudomallei or B. pseudomallei lipopolysaccharide in vitro, compared with WT cells. Strikingly, CD14 KO mice intranasally inoculated with B. pseudomallei demonstrated reduced lethality and significantly decreased bacterial outgrowth, compared with WT mice. Administration of recombinant soluble CD14 to CD14 KO mice partially reversed their phenotype to that of WT mice. Lastly, CD14 deficiency did not alter the capacity of macrophages or neutrophils to phagocytose or kill B. pseudomallei. CONCLUSION: CD14 is crucially involved in the recognition of B. pseudomallei by innate immune cells but plays a remarkable detrimental role in the host response against B. pseudomallei.

CTCF and the associated cohesin complex play a central role in insulator function and higher-order chromatin organization of mammalian genomes.

To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and \u03b2-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences.",

The primary endpoint was overall survival. We analysed survival outcomes by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00689221. FINDINGS: Overall, 3471 patients were screened. Of these patients, 3060 had tumour MGMT status tested; 926 patients had a methylated MGMT promoter, and 545 were randomly assigned to the cilengitide (n=272) or control groups (n=273) between Oct 31, 2008, and May 12, 2011. Median overall survival was 26\u00b73 months (95% CI 23\u00b78-28\u00b78) in the cilengitide group and 26\u00b73 months (23\u00b79-34\u00b77) in the control group (hazard ratio 1\u00b702, 95% CI 0\u00b781-1\u00b729, p=0\u00b786). None of the predefined clinical subgroups showed a benefit from cilengitide. We noted no overall additional toxic effects with cilengitide treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the safety population were lymphopenia (31 [12%] in the cilengitide group vs 26 [10%] in the control group), thrombocytopenia (28 [11%] vs 46 [18%]), neutropenia (19 [7%] vs 24 [9%]), leucopenia (18 [7%] vs 20 [8%]), and convulsion (14 [5%] vs 15 [6%]). INTERPRETATION: The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug. Nevertheless, integrins remain a potential treatment target for glioblastoma. FUNDING: Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.",

Thyroid hormone is a major regulator of thermogenesis, acting both in peripheral organs and on central autonomic pathways. Mice heterozygous for a point mutation in thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 display increased thermogenesis as a consequence of high sympathetic brown fat stimulation. Surprisingly, despite the hypermetabolism, their body temperature is not elevated. Here we show, using isolated tail arteries, that defective thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 signaling impairs acetylcholine-mediated vascular relaxation as well as phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction. Using infrared thermography on conscious animals, we demonstrate that these defects severely interfere with appropriate peripheral heat conservation and dissipation, which in turn leads to compensatory alterations in brown fat activity. Consequently, when the vasoconstrictive defect in mice heterozygous for a point mutation in thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 was reversed with the selective \u03b11-adrenergic agonist midodrine, the inappropriate heat loss over their tail surface was reduced, normalizing brown fat activity and energy expenditure. Our analyses demonstrate that thyroid hormone plays a key role in vascular heat conservation and dissipation processes, adding a unique aspect to its well-documented functions in thermoregulation. The data thus facilitate understanding of temperature hypersensitivity in patients with thyroid disorders. Moreover, the previously unrecognized connection between cardiovascular regulation and metabolic activity revealed in this study challenges the interpretation of several experimental paradigms and questions some of the currently derived hypotheses on the role of thyroid hormone in thermogenesis.",

BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic relapsing skin disease. Recent studies have shown promising results of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab and adalimumab in the treatment of HS. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to compare 2 cohorts of 10 adult patients suffering from severe, recalcitrant HS. In 2005, 10 patients were treated with infliximab intravenous (i.v.) (3 infusions of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6). In 2009, 10 other patients were treated in the same hospital with adalimumab subcutaneous (s.c.) 40 mg every other week. Both cohorts were followed up for 1 year using identical evaluation methods [Sartorius score, quality of life index, reduction of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), patient and doctor global assessment, and duration of efficacy]. RESULTS: Nineteen patients completed the study. In both groups, the severity of the HS diminished. Infliximab performed better in all aspects. The average Sartorius score was reduced to 54% of baseline for the infliximab group and 66% of baseline for the adalimumab group.

Zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene targeting of a single-copy gp91(phox) therapeutic minigene into one allele of the \"safe harbor\" AAVS1 locus in X-CGD iPSCs without off-target inserts resulted in sustained expression of gp91(phox) and substantially restored neutrophil ROS production.

INTRODUCTION: The 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' remains the leading hypothesis to explain the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to remove the neurotoxic amyloid \u03b242 protein and prevent the hypothesized amyloid \u03b242-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. The most notable of these immunotherapies are bapineuzumab and solanezumab. AREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews the experimental agents in development for treatment of AD and then discusses the results of bapineuzumab and solanezumab in AD patients, as reported in preclinical studies, clinical trials and press releases. EXPERT OPINION: Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Solanezumab's two Phase III trials in AD patients failed to meet endpoints when analyzed independently. However, analysis of pooled data from both trials showed a significant reduction in cognitive decline in mild AD patients. The improvement was associated with an increase in plasma amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels and a low incidence of ARIA in solanezumab-treated patients. The marginal benefits of solanezumab are encouraging to support continued evaluation in future studies, and offer small support in favor of the ongoing viability of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' of AD.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of proteasome inhibition on reductive CREB activity are still unclear. The current study demonstrated that MG132-inhibited proteasome activity resulted in a dose dependence of CREB dephosphorylation at Ser133 as well as decreased phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B (Tyr1472) and its tyrosine protein kinase Fyn (Tyr416). These dephosphorylations are probably caused by disturbance of expression and post-translational modifications of tau protein since tau siRNA decreased the activity of Fyn, NR2B, and CREB. To further confirm this perspective, HEK293 cells stably expressing human tau441 protein were treated with MG132 and dephosphorylations of CREB and NR2B were observed.

AIM: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This study aimed to clarify the association between cystatin C and arteriosclerosis in a non-CKD population. METHODS: Of the 637 Japanese adults (264 men, 373 women) enrolled, we analyzed 446 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 mL/min and no proteinuria (177 men, 269 women) without a history of CVD. Kidney function was evaluated according to serum cystatin C levels and eGFR. Arteriosclerosis was evaluated on the basis of the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). RESULTS: The mean age of our subjects was 67.0\u00b110.0 years. No variables showed any significant differences according to gender. The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between serum cystatin C and CAVI only in women, but not CIMT.

The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a familial disease characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization and high incidence of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias often occurring in conditions of adrenergic activation. Recently, the genes for the LQTS inked to chromosomes 3 (LQT3), 7 (LQT2), and 11 (LQT1) were identified as SCN5A, the cardiac sodium channel gene and as HERG and KvLQT1 potassium channel genes. These discoveries have paved the way for the development of gene-specific therapy for these three forms of LQTS. In order to test specific interventions potentially beneficial in the molecular variants of LQTS, we developed a cellular model to mimic the electrophysiological abnormalities of LQT3 and LQT2. Isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes were exposed to anthopleurin and dofetilide in order to mimic LQT3 and LQT2, respectively. This model has been used to study the effect of sodium channel blockade and of rapid pacing showing a pronounced action potential shortening in response to Na+ channel blockade with mexiletine and during rapid pacing only in anthopleurin-treated cells but not in dofetilide-treated cells. Based on these results we tested the hypothesis that QT interval would shorten more in LQT3 patients in response to mexiletine and to increases in heart rate. Mexiletine shortened significantly the QT interval among LQT3 patients but not among LQT2 patients. LQT3 patients shortened their QT interval in response to increases in heart rate much more than LQT2 patients and healthy controls. These findings suggest that LQT3 patients are more likely to benefit from Na+ channel blockers and from cardiac pacing because they are at higher arrhythmic risk at slow heart rates. Conversely, LQT2 patients are at higher risk to develop syncope under stressful conditions, because of the combined arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines with the insufficient adaptation of their QT interval. Along the same line of development of gene-specific therapy, recent data demonstrated that an increase in the extracellular concentration of potassium shortens the QT interval in LQT2 patients suggesting that intervention aimed at increasing potassium plasma levels may represent a specific treatment for LQT2. The molecular findings on LQTS suggest the possibility of developing therapeutic interventions targeted to specific genetic defects. Until definitive data become available, antiadrenergic therapy remains the mainstay in the management of LQTS patients, however it may be soon worth considering the addition of a Na+ channel blocker such as mexiletine for LQT3 patients and of interventions such as K+ channel openers or increases in the extracellular concentration of potassium for LQT1 and LQT2 patients.",

BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a severe disease with high case-fatality and morbidity rates. After SAH, the value of C-reactive protein (CRP)--an acute phase sensitive inflammatory marker--as a prognostic factor has been poorly studied, with conflicting results. In this prospective study, we tested whether increased CRP levels increase independently the risk for cerebral infarct and poor outcome. METHODS: Previous diseases as well as clinical, laboratory and radiological variables were recorded for 178 patients with SAH admitted within 48 h and with aneurysms occluded within 60 h after bleeding. Plasma CRP was measured, as well as computed tomography (CT) scans routinely obtained on admission, in the morning after aneurysm occlusion, and at discharge during second week after SAH. Factors predicting occurrence of cerebral infarct and poor outcome at 3 months after SAH were tested with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: CRP levels increased significantly (p < 0.001) between hospital admission (mean \u00b1 SD, 11.4 \u00b1 21.3 mg/l) and the postoperative morning (27.0 \u00b1 31.0 mg/l) and then decreased (p < 0.001) during the the second week (19.8 \u00b1 25.0 mg/l). Admission (18.0 \u00b1 35.7 vs 8.5 \u00b1 8.4 mg/l) and postoperative (41.0 \u00b1 40.2 vs 21.1 \u00b1 24.1 mg/l) CRP levels were higher (p < 0.001) in those with a poor outcome than in those with a favourable outcome, but CRP values did not predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or cerebral infarction. CRP levels did not independently predict outcome, since these correlated with admission clinical grade and occurrence of intraventricular haemorrhage. Higher increase in CRP level between admission and postoperative morning, however, independently predicted poor outcome (p = 0.004). Part of this increased risk was likely due to an appearance of early postoperative cerebral infarction. CONCLUSIONS: CRP levels correlate with outcome but do not seem to predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or infarction after SAH.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This present review gives an overview on different approaches on systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis with a focus on molecules that are presently investigated as defined target structures in clinical studies with patients with atopic dermatitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Available systemic drugs for the treatment of atopic dermatitis are limited. There is a high need for the development of new treatment regimen. Current studies address novel biologicals or small molecules for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In particular, interventions in the T-helper 2 cell (Th2) allergic inflammation are promising. Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis. A number of other target molecules is currently addressed in clinical studies with blocking antibodies against target molecules of Th2 polarized inflammation in atopic dermatitis (e.g. interleukins 13, 22, 31, thymic stromal lymphopoetin). Inhibiting phospodiesterase-4, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule 2, the histamine-4 receptor, or the neurokine-1 receptor may lead to the approval of novel 'small drugs' for a specific treatment of atopic dermatitis. Antifungals may be helpful in the variant of head and neck dermatitis associated with sensitizations against Malassezia species. Induction of specific immune tolerance (e.g. with allergen-specific immunotherapy) should be further studied in terms of the management of atopic dermatitis because available clinical studies resulted in inconsistent results on the skin condition. SUMMARY: Current studies with new substances for the systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis have tremendous implications for the future management of atopic dermatitis.",

The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-uptake, storage and release. Residing in the SR lumen, HRC binds Ca(2+) with high capacity but low affinity. In vitro phosphorylation of HRC affects ryanodine affinity of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), suggesting a functional role of HRC on SR Ca(2+)-release. Indeed, acute HRC overexpression in isolated rodent cardiomyocytes decreases Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release, increases SR Ca(2+)-load, and impairs contractility. The HRC effects on RyR may be regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. However, HRC also affects the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase, as shown by HRC overexpression in transgenic mouse hearts, which resulted in reduced SR Ca(2+)-uptake rates, cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy. In fact, in vitro generated evidence suggests that HRC directly interacts with SR Ca(2+)-ATPase2, supporting a dual role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis: regulation of both SR Ca(2+)-uptake and Ca(2+)-release. Furthermore, HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",

The cohesin protein complex holds sister chromatids in dividing cells together and is essential for chromosome segregation. Recently, cohesin has been implicated in mediating transcriptional insulation, via its interactions with CTCF. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes are preferentially bound by both ER and cohesin, and functionally, the silencing of cohesin caused aberrant re-entry of breast cancer cells into cell cycle after hormone treatment. We combined chromosomal interaction data in MCF-7 cells with our cohesin binding data to show that cohesin is highly enriched at ER-bound regions that capture inter-chromosomal loop anchors. Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions.",

BACKGROUND: The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy that usually begins in early childhood, is difficult to treat. Dose-related drug toxicity is common. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the antiepileptic drug lamotrigine in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eligible patients had more than one type of predominantly generalized seizure, including tonic-clonic, atonic, tonic, and major myoclonic, and had seizures on average at least every other day. After a 4-week base-line period in which all participants received placebo, we randomly assigned 169 patients (age range, 3 to 25 years) to 16 weeks of lamotrigine (n= 79) or placebo (n=90) in addition to their other antiepileptic drugs. RESULTS: The median frequency of all major seizures changed from base-line levels of 16.4 and 13.5 per week in the lamotrigine and placebo groups, respectively, to 9.9 and 14.2 per week after 16 weeks of treatment (P=0.002). Thirty-three percent of the patients in the lamotrigine group and 16 percent of those in the placebo group had a reduction of at least 50 percent in the frequency of seizures (P= 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events, except for colds or viral illnesses, which was more common in the lamotrigine group (P=0.05).

BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma. Other types of cancer may also benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies. In biliary tract cancer, reported BRAF mutation rates are highly controversial, ranging from 0 to 33% in adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder and 0 to 22% in cholangiocarcinoma. We here analyzed tissue microarrays of a large cohort of biliary tract cancer (n=377) including 159 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 149 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 69 adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder for BRAF V600E mutation using a highly sensitive immunohistochemical screening approach implementing the BRAF V600E protein-specific antibody VE1. All VE1-positive cases as well as 42 VE1-negative cases were additionally analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In total, only 5 VE1-positive cases were detected (5/377; 1%). BRAF V600E mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases. All 5 mutated cases were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (5/159; 3%). None of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder were VE1 positive. Apart from the subtype restriction of BRAF V600E mutation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a female predominance (4 female, 1 male), no significant correlation with clinicopathological data and patient outcome was detected. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BRAF V600E mutation is a rare event in biliary tract cancer, accounting for only 1% of all subtypes, and is restricted to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a feasible approach to routinely screen for BRAF V600E mutation in biliary tract cancer patients, thereby facilitating the detection of rare patients who may benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies.",

The expression of ANK, a key player in biomineralization, is stimulated by treatment with TGFbeta. The purpose of this study was to determine whether TGFbeta stimulation of ANK expression during chondrogenesis was dependent upon the influx of calcium and phosphate into cells. Treatment of ATDC5 cells with TGFbeta increased ANK expression during all phases of chondrogenic differentiation, particularly at day 14 (proliferation) and day 32 (mineralizing hypertrophy) of culture. Phosphate uptake studies in the presence and absence of phosphonoformic acid (PFA), a competitive inhibitor of the type III Na(+)/Pi channels Pit-1 and Pit-2, indicated that the stimulation of ANK expression by TGFbeta required the influx of phosphate, specifically by the Pit-1 transporter, at all phases of differentiation. At hypertrophy, when alkaline phosphatase is highly expressed, inhibition of its activity with levamisole also abrogated the stimulatory effect of TGFbeta on ANK expression, further illustrating that Pi availability and uptake by the cells is necessary for stimulation of ANK expression in response to TGFbeta. Since previous studies of endochondral ossification in the growth plate have shown that L-type calcium channels are essential for chondrogenesis, we investigated their role in the TGFbeta-stimulated ANK response in ATDC5 cells. Treatment with nifedipine to inhibit calcium influx via the L-type channel Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) inhibited the TGFbeta stimulated increase in ANK expression at all phases of chondrogenesis.

All participants' hospital records were reviewed and each woman completed a questionnaire and attended an interview. Pregnancy rates were compared between the study and control groups. In the study group, pregnancy rates were compared before and after surgery. RESULTS: Amongst the 38 women desiring pregnancy after endometrioma surgery, 19 (50%) achieved a spontaneous pregnancy during the follow-up period. This was not significantly different from a pre-operative pregnancy rate of 48% (22/46). Of these 19 patients, four achieved another pregnancy with fertility treatment. An additional eight patients conceived only with the help of fertility treatment, giving an overall long-term post-operative pregnancy rate of 71% (27/38). These results were significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the 98% (57/58) long-term natural pregnancy rate in the control group. Pregnancy rates in patients receiving fertility treatment significantly (p=0.001) increased from 7% (1/15) before surgery to 63% (12/19) post-operatively.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of heart failure and a primary cause for heart transplantation in patients below the age of 40 years. Despite major advances in diagnostic procedures such as examination of myocardial biopsies, the etiology remains unknown in many patients. Chronic inflammation or myocarditis and chronic alcohol abuse are considered two main etiologic factors in dilated cardiomyopathy. A third causal factor, namely genetic transmission of the disease, is at least as common as myocardial inflammation or toxic damage. Several prospective studies of relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy proved that about 25-30% of all cases are of familial etiology. The most common mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant. Less frequently is the disease inherited as an X-chromosomal trait. Autosomal recessive and mitochondrial transmission is rare. The penetrance is highly variable and age dependent. Many relatives of patients with DCM show only minor cardiac abnormalities and it is unknown whether they progress to full cardiomyopathy in later life. Examination of families has identified so far eight disease genes, namely the dystrophin, tafazzin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, delta- sarcoglycan, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin T gene. Certain mutations in lamin A/C cause conduction system disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas other mutations cause in addition skeletal muscle myopathy. Dystrophin mutations are the cause of the rare X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy without skeletal muscle involvement and a progressive course in young men. Other mutations in the dystrophin gene, mainly deletions, are the cause of the muscular dystrophy Becker and Duchenne which also present with dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutations of the desmin,  delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. The infantile X-linked DCM is caused by mutations of the tafazzin gene. The onset of the disease is typically within the first year of life and death occurs usually in childhood. Most patients may in addition be characterized by skeletal myopathy, short stature, neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria, also referred to as Barth syndrome. Knowledge of the DCM disease genes led to the new hypothesis that dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardial force generation or force transmission. Many more disease loci are known but the responsible disease genes are not yet identified. Better understanding of the expression and function of disease genes may eventually result in new diagnostic and therapeutic tools in order to improve the prognosis of this severe disorder.",

A local chemotherapy applied directly to the resection cavity may act directly on residual tumor cells in adjacent brain possibly leading to a local control of the tumor and increased survival. METHODS: We have analyzed the pattern of recurrence using serial MRI studies of 24 patients treated with GLIADEL Wafers or placebo wafers following resection of glioblastomas. RESULTS: Of 24 patients 11 received carmustine wafers and 13 placebo. The age distribution and Karnowsky performance scores of the two populations were not different. However, the median survival (14.7 versus 9.5 months; P = 0.007) and the time to neurological deterioration (12.9 +/- 4.85 vs. 9.4 +/- 2.73 months; P = 0.035) was significantly longer in the treatment group versus the placebo treated control. Preoperative and follow up MRI studies were evaluated in a blinded fashion. Out of 24 patients that entered the analysis 11 showed clearance of all contrast enhancement following resection of glioblastomas. Seventeen tumors progressed locally and 7 showed different patterns of distant failure. Within the carmustine treated group 8 patients showed a local treatment failure with recurrent tumors immediately adjacent to the resection cavity or progression form a residual tumor. Three patients showed a multifocal distant and local pattern of failure after complete or subtotal removal. In no case the local chemotherapy resulted in a distant recurrence only. However, the time to radiographic progression was 165.1 +/- 80.75 days for the GLIADEL Wafer group and 101.9 +/- 43.06 days for the placebo group (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: In this subgroup analysis of a phase III trial population both the clinical progression and radiological progression were significantly delayed in patients treated with local chemotherapy, resulting in an increased survival time. Local chemotherapy with carmustine containing wafer implants did not result in an altered pattern of recurrence and did not promote multifocal patterns of recurrence.",

We have addressed the issue of reversibility of the disease in the Gaa(-/-) mouse model. We have made transgenic lines expressing human GAA in skeletal and cardiac muscle of Gaa(-/-) mice, and we turned the transgene on at different stages of disease progression by using a tetracycline-controllable system.

However, in skeletal muscle-a major organ affected in infantile and in milder, late-onset variants in humans-induction of GAA expression in young Gaa(-/-) mice to levels greatly exceeding wildtype values did not result in full phenotypic correction, and some muscle fibers showed little or no glycogen clearance.

Critical to further our understanding of exosomes is the development of reagents, tools, and protocols for their isolation, characterization, and analysis of their RNA and protein contents. Here we describe a complete exosome workflow solution, starting from fast and efficient extraction of exosomes from cell culture media and serum to isolation of RNA followed by characterization of exosomal RNA content using qRT-PCR and next-generation sequencing techniques. Effectiveness of this workflow is exemplified by analysis of the RNA content of exosomes derived from HeLa cell culture media and human serum, using Ion Torrent PGM as a sequencing platform.",

We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peritoneal carcinomatosis in women frequently has an ovarian origin. Hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) along with radical surgery/peritonectomy could present a new therapeutic approach with curative intention. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the role of the administration of HIPEC. METHODS: A series of patients (N=26) diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (stage III) from January 1997 to December 2004 submitted to radical surgery/peritonectomy with optimal cytoreduction (R0-R1) were included in this study, 14 treated with HIPEC and 12 without HIPEC. RESULTS: The variables age, histologic type, peritonectomy procedures, peritoneal cancer index (PCI) and lymph node affectation were similar in both groups. The 5-year global survival was 58% and 17% (p=0.046), and 67% and 29% in patients with maximal cytoreduction (R0) (p=0.264), in the HIPEC- and non-HIPEC-treated patients, respectively. In patients with optimal cytoreduction and partial peritonectomy, 5-year global survival was also superior in the HIPEC group (75% vs. 11%, p=0.011). Average time free of disease was superior in the HIPEC group (48+/-42 vs. 24+/-21 months), with less reinterventions due to a new reappearance during the first three evolutionary years (2/14 vs. 4/12). Postoperative morbidity did not show substantial differences in both groups and there was no surgical mortality. CONCLUSIONS: HIPEC is a complement to radical surgery/ peritonectomy, which has been shown to be a surgical procedure with high tolerability, low morbimortality, enhanced survival and prolonged disease-free interval in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent ovarian cancer.",

Chromodomains are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions between chromatin components. We have detected a chromodomain embedded within the catalytic region of a predicted Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase that is diverged from other eukaryotic enzymes. The 791 residue \"chromomethylase\" (CMT1) is encoded by a floral transcript that is spliced from 20 exons and is present at only approximately 1/10(-7) of total mRNA. Genomic sequencing reveals an ancient haplotype split at CMT1 between Col-0 + Metz and the other ecotypes examined. In the Col-0 + Metz haplotype, alternative mRNA processing at intron 13 truncates the coding region. In Ler, RLD, and No-0, similar truncation is caused by insertion of an intact retrotransposon, Evelknievel, which is present as a single copy in Ler and RLD and is currently methylated and inactive. Evelknievel is found at this site on a single branch that connects the Ler, RLD, and No-0 ecotypes but is absent from the genomes of all other ecotypes examined. A stop codon within exon 6 of the Metz ecotype confirms that CMT1 is nonessential. Nevertheless, comparison to CMT1 of Cardaminopsis arenosa, an outcrossing relative, indicates conservation for DNA methyltransferase function. We discuss how allelic diversity of CMT1 may reflect loosened selective constraints in a self-fertilizing species such as Arabidopsis thaliana.",

MDM2 negatively regulates p53 stability and many human tumors overproduce MDM2 as a mechanism to restrict p53 function. Thus, inhibitors of p53-MDM2 binding that can reactivate p53 in cancer cells may offer an effective approach for cancer therapy. RG7112 is a potent and selective member of the nutlin family of MDM2 antagonists currently in phase I clinical studies. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. A crystal structure of the RG7112-MDM2 complex revealed that the small molecule binds in the p53 pocket of MDM2, mimicking the interactions of critical p53 amino acid residues. Treatment of cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 with RG7112 activated the p53 pathway, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 showed potent antitumor activity against a panel of solid tumor cell lines. However, its apoptotic activity varied widely with the best response observed in osteosarcoma cells with MDM2 gene amplification. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase activity did not change the kinetics of p53-induced cell death. Oral administration of RG7112 to human xenograft-bearing mice at nontoxic concentrations caused dose-dependent changes in proliferation/apoptosis biomarkers as well as tumor inhibition and regression. Notably, RG7112 was highly synergistic with androgen deprivation in LNCaP xenograft tumors. Our findings offer a preclinical proof-of-concept that RG7112 is effective in treatment of solid tumors expressing wild-type p53.",

BACKGROUND: At the time of writing only dopamine agonists are licensed for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in various countries, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed with other treatments. We performed comprehensive meta-analyses and indirect comparisons of RCTs for all currently recommended treatments of RLS. METHODS: We searched the Central, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases. Outcome measures were the international RLS study group severity scale (IRLS), clinical global impression-improvement, (CGI-I), periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and psychosocial parameters such as quality of life (QoL). We also conducted indirect comparisons by testing for heterogeneity between the substance groups. RESULTS: Placebo (58 trials) and actively (4 trials) controlled RCTs with dopamine agonists (38 trials), levodopa (4 trials), anticonvulsants (13 trials), most of them with \u03b1\u2082\u03b4 ligands (11 trials), opioids (1 trial), and iron treatments (6 trials) were included (9596 patients). Although treatment effects showed large variations, changes in the IRLS in the substance groups were comparable (P = 0.78), with a mean reduction in the IRLS of -5.47 points for dopamine agonists, -5.12 points for anticonvulsants (\u03b1\u2082\u03b4 ligands and levetiracetam), and -4.59 points for iron treatments. The CGI-I indicated slightly different treatment effects between the substance groups, while PLMI changes during treatment differed (P = 0.002), showing a marked decrease with dopamine agonists (-22.50/h), levodopa (-26.01/h), and oxycodone (-34.46/h) compared with a slight decrease for anticonvulsants (\u03b1\u2082\u03b4 ligands and levetiracetam; -8.48/h) and iron treatments (-13.10/h). Quality of sleep and QoL improved moderately in most of the RCTs investigating these parameters (standardized mean difference, SMD) 0.40 and 0.33, respectively). In the few studies evaluating the change of depressive (n = 4) or anxiety symptoms (n = 3), these symptoms improved slightly (SMD -0.24, and -0.21). Adverse effects and dropouts were comparable in number across all substance groups. In meta-regressions, the treatment effect was predicted by the design of the trial (the more sites involved in a trial the lower the effect) and by the duration of action of a medication (the longer the duration of action, expressed as the half-life time of a substance, the greater the improvement), the latter indicating potential superiority of treatments with stable blood concentration. CONCLUSION: This first meta-analysis of all RCTs for the pharmacological treatment of RLS provides evidence that, besides the well-defined efficacy of dopaminergic treatment, other treatments with different pharmacological principles show efficacy in small samples and may be well-tolerated alternatives for the treatment of RLS. In the group of anticonvulsants, only the trials performed with \u03b1\u2082\u03b4 ligands such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin showed good efficacy. This indicates a specific mechanism of action of these substances in RLS. The group of iron treatments consisted of a few trials with different compounds in oral and intravenous application form, respectively. For a more differentiated evaluation of the efficacy of iron treatments further studies are necessary. The large efficacy of one opioid RCT in RLS has to be confirmed in further studies.",

The functional importance of gene enhancers in regulated gene expression is well established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17\u03b2-oestradiol (E2)-bound oestrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes. These induced eRNAs, as functional transcripts, seem to exert important roles for the observed ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the strength of specific enhancer-promoter looping initiated by ER-\u03b1 binding. Cohesin, present on many ER-\u03b1-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment, apparently contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by stabilizing E2/ER-\u03b1/eRNA-induced enhancer-promoter looping.

METHODS: Three concentrations of tretinoin (0.05%, 0.01%, and 0.001%) in a new emollient cream formulation were compared with vehicle in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of 296 subjects with photodamaged facial skin. RESULTS: Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% gave a significantly better global response to therapy than vehicle (p less than 0.001), with 68% of subjects exhibiting improvement at the end of therapy, compared with 43% of subjects in the vehicle group. An excellent or good response was found in 26% of subjects treated with tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% versus 11% of vehicle-treated subjects. Fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness were more improved in subjects who received tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% than in vehicle-treated subjects (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between vehicle and tretinoin emollient cream 0.01% or 0.001%. Histologic examination showed increases in epidermal and granular layer thickness, decreased melanin content and compaction of the stratum corneum after therapy with tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% or 0.01%. Mild to moderate skin reactions, such as erythema, peeling, and burning, were the most common side effects and, although most prevalent in the group using the 0.05% concentration, generally did not limit tretinoin use.

Recently, a novel antiapoptosis gene, i.e., survivin, was identified as a structurally unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. Survivin expression is turned off during fetal development and not found in non-neoplastic adult human tissues but is again turned on in the most common human cancers. The antiapoptotic properties of survivin might provide a significant growth advantage in tumors and possibly also contribute to chemoresistance of cancer. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of survivin in human renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), known to be largely resistant to chemotherapy. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR revealed survivin expression in newly established RCC cell lines (n = 11) of all major histological types. Moreover, we identified two novel splice variants of survivin, lacking exon 3 (survivin-deltaEx3) or retaining a part of intron 2 as a cryptic exon (survivin-2B). Both sequence alterations cause marked changes in the structure of the corresponding proteins, including structural modifications of the baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat domain. The role of the novel isoforms in the regulation of apoptosis was assessed in transfection experiments, showing conservation of antiapoptotic properties for survivin-deltaEx3 and a markedly reduced antiapoptotic potential for survivin-2B. In conclusion, our observations suggest a complex regulatory balance between the different isoforms of survivin, which might determine the response to proapoptotic stimuli, not only in human RCCs but also in fetal tissues and other types of cancer.",

INTRODUCTION: PDE5 inhibitors are the firstline treatment for erectile dysfunction. Although all these drugs share the same mechanism of action, each agent could have different characteristics in terms of selectivity, pharmacokinetics and tolerability profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This manuscript illustrates a project, undertaken by the Italian Society of Urology in order to obtain a \"snapshot\" of the experience of Italian urologists with the use of PDE5 inhibitors in the clinical practice. This project included a survey, targeting a sample of 136 Italian urologists experienced in the treatment of ED, and the organization of a conference of experts who, based on the findings of the survey, the scientific literature and the clinical experience, would define some recommendations for the use of PDE5 inhibitors in clinical practice with a particular focus on Avanafil, the most recent drug in this class. RESULTS: The following recommendations on the use of Avanafil were issued: 1) In patients who are candidates for the use of Avanafil, it is advisable to use the 200-mg dose from the first administration; 2) When used at the highest dose (200 mg), Avanafil shows a favourable tolerability profile with an efficacy similar to that of other agents; 3) The patient should be instructed to take Avanafil on an empty stomach, i.e., 30-45 minutes before or 2 hours after a meal; 4) The efficacy window of Avanafil is between 30 minutes and 6 hours after dosing, which qualifies this molecule as a new drug with an intermediate duration of action; 5) Avanafil at a dose of 50-100 mg/day may be a therapeutic option in chronic rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Among PDE5 inhibitors, Avanafil is a new agent with an intermediate duration of action, characterized by high efficacy and good tolerability even at the highest dose (200 mg).",

Despite the fact that 45% of all human gene promoters do not contain CpG islands, the role of DNA methylation in control of non-CpG island promoters is controversial and its relevance in normal and pathological processes is poorly understood. Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically methylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures comprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG island promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that aberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to tumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer epigenetics.",

A 60-year-old woman had been treated for parkinsonism at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology since August 1999. She began to groan involuntarily in the daytime in September 2001. She could not eat well while groaning. Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration. During expiration, however, the vocal cords adducted, resulting in the involuntary production of voice. Electromyography showed an increase in the activity of the thyroarytenoid and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles. This muscle activity was further enhanced during inspiration. The involuntary phonation disappeared when the patient's dose of L-dopa was decreased, although she had a decrease in her systemic mobility as well. When the dose of L-dopa was increased to the therapeutic level, involuntary phonation recurred, and her voluntary systemic activity improved. In the present case, it was considered that excessive dopaminergic denervation occurred in the nerve innervating the laryngeal adductors. Involuntary voice appeared to be produced by hypertonus of the laryngeal adductors because of a lowering in the threshold level for L-dopa, even though the drug was administered at the usual dose.",

The prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains disappointing due to a high intrinsic       resistance against chemotherapeutic agents. Standard gemcitabine therapies have       improved overall survival only marginally and recently, inhibition of the proteasome       by the boronic acid derivative bortezomib has been introduced as a novel therapeutic       strategy for solid and hematological malignancies including pancreatic cancer.       The mucus-producing pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 was cultured under standard       conditions and treated with different concentrations of gemcitabine or bortezomib.       Mucus production was suppressed by siRNA-mediated silencing of apomucin genes.       Cell proliferation was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and apoptosis       was quantified after propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry. Apoptotic cell       death was confirmed by TUNEL staining, determination of mitochondrial transmembrane       potential and assessment of caspase 3/7 activity. NF\u03baB-activity was determined       by EMSA. The unfolded protein response (UPR) was further investigated by PCR,       Western blotting and caspase 12 activity assays. Silencing of MUC4 significantly       reduced expression of mucins for up to 5 days after transfection. While native       cells showed an increased sensitivity to bortezomib treatment, silenced cells       were more sensitive to gemcitabine treatment. Bortezomib induces mitochondrial       damage in native cells and also activates the UPR by splicing of Xbp-1 and induction       of CHOP, which is significantly reduced by silencing of MUC4. Our data suggest       that mucinous pancreatic cancers are more sensitive towards proteasome inhibition       by bortezomib and that alternative pathways of apoptosis are involved in cell       death induction, while tumor cells with a low secretory activity show a better       response to gemcitabine.",

CD99 is a 32-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that is encoded by the MIC2 gene. Our study was carried out to examine the role of CD99 in tumor progression of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Here, we showed that lowly expressed CD99 protein in cHL cell lines and primary cHL cases correlates with the deficient expression of the positive regulatory domain 1 (PRDM1/BLIMP1). In addition, cHL cell lines showed high levels of miR-9 expression. We determined that the upregulation of CD99 induced expression of transcription factor PRDM1, a master regulator of plasma-cell differentiation, which is also a target for miR-9-mediated downregulation. Indeed, inhibition of miR-9 also triggered upregulation of PRDM1 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of CD99 resulted in changed growth features and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. As upregulation of CD99 led to a decrease in cHL diagnosis marker CD30 and CD15 and an increase in plasma-cell differentiation marker CD38 and the restoration of B-cell makers PAX5, CD79\u03b1 and CD19, we suggest that downregulated CD99 leads to the prevention of plasma-cell differentiation in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (H/RS) cells. Furthermore, these data indicate that CD99 may control miR-9 expression, which directly targets PRDM1. Altogether, these results reveal a CD99-miR-9-PRDM1 molecule axis in lymphomagenesis of cHL and suggest that upregulation of CD99 in H/RS cells induces terminal B-cell differentiation, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategies for cHL.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the inclusion of amoxicillin correlates with better recovery rates in the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic food. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared data from the treatment of two groups of children in Malawi aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition. The standard protocol group received a 7-day course of amoxicillin at the onset of treatment. The alternate protocol group received no antibiotics. All children were treated with the same ready-to-use therapeutic food. The primary outcome was nutritional recovery, defined as achieving a weight-for-height Z-score > -2 without oedema. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-eight children were treated according to the standard protocol with amoxicillin, and 1955 were treated under the alternate protocol without antibiotics. The group of children treated with amoxicillin was slightly older and more stunted at baseline. The recovery rate for children who received amoxicillin was worse at 4 weeks (40%vs. 71%) but similar after up to 12 weeks of therapy (84%vs. 86%), compared to the children treated without antibiotics. Regression modelling indicated that this difference at 4 weeks was most strongly associated with the receipt of amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: This review of two therapeutic feeding programmes suggests that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated without amoxicillin did not have an inferior rate of recovery. Given the limitations of this retrospective analysis, a prospective trial is warranted to determine the effect of antibiotics on recovery from uncomplicated malnutrition with home-based therapy.",

However, under persistent stress conditions, ATF4 promotes the induction of apoptosis.

In this study we devise a peptide inhibitor screening strategy to target the GEF activity of Tgat, an oncogenic isoform of the RhoGEF Trio, based on random mutations of the Trio inhibitor TRIP alpha, which we previously isolated using a peptide aptamer screen. This identifies one peptide, TRIP(E32G), which specifically inhibits Tgat GEF activity in vitro and significantly reduces Tgat-induced RhoA activation and foci formation. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of cells expressing Tgat and TRIP(E32G) into nude mice reduces the formation of Tgat-induced tumors. Our approach thus demonstrates that peptide aptamers are potent inhibitors that can be used to interfere with RhoGEF functions in vivo.",

The sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet points.

Finally, we identify four recursively spliced human genes, one of which is also recursively spliced in Drosophila.

We intended to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose MgSO4 therapy after SAH as means to prevent DIND and to evaluate the impact on clinical outcome. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study. The MgSO4 infusion was adjusted every 12 hours until day 12 according to the target serum Mg2+ level. The occurrence of DIND, secondary infarction, side effects, and the outcome after 3 and 12 months were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were randomized; 27 received placebo and 31 MgSO4. The difference in occurrence of DIND and secondary infarction was not significant. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a trend toward better outcome (P = .083) after 3 months. On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083). Significantly more often hypotension (P = .040) and hypocalcemia (P = .005) occurred as side effects in the treatment group.

OBJECT: Vasospasm remains a significant source of neurological morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), despite advances in current medical, surgical, and endovascular therapies. Magnesium sulfate therapy has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective in preventing neurological complications in obstetrical patients with eclampsia. Evidence obtained using experimental models of brain injury, cerebral ischemia, and SAH indicate that Mg may also have a role as a neuroprotective agent. The authors hypothesize that MgSO4 therapy is safe, feasible, and has a beneficial effect on vasospasm and, ultimately, on neurological outcome following aneurysmal SAH. METHODS: A prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial of high-dose MgSO4 therapy following aneurysmal SAH (Hunt and Hess Grades II-IV) was performed in 40 patients, who were enrolled within 72 hours following SAH and given intravenous MgSO4 or control solution for 10 days. Serum Mg++ levels were maintained in the 4 to 5.5 mg/dl range throughout the treatment period. Clinical management principles were the same between groups (including early use of surgery or endovascular treatment, followed by aggressive vasospasm prophylaxis and treatment). Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonographic recordings were obtained, and clinical outcomes were measured using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). The patients' GOS scores and the TCD recordings were analyzed using the independent t-test. Forty patients were enrolled in the study: 20 (15 female and five male patients) received treatment and 20 (11 female and nine male patients) comprised a control group. The mean ages of the patients in these groups were 46 and 51, respectively, and the mean clinical Hunt and Hess grades were 2.6 +/- 0.68 in the MgSO4 treatment group and 2.3 +/- 0.73 in the control group (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], p = 0.87). Fisher grades were similar in both groups. Mean middle cerebral artery velocities were 93 +/- 27 cm/second in MgSO4-treated patients and 102 +/- 34 cm/second in the control group (mean +/- SD, p = 0.41). Symptomatic vasospasm, confirmed by angiography, occurred in six of 20 patients receiving MgSO4 and in five of 16 patients receiving placebo. Mean GOS scores were 3.8 +/- 1.6 and 3.6 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- SD, p = 0.74) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Significant adverse effects from treatment with MgSO4 did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of high-dose MgSO4 following aneurysmal SAH is safe, and steady Mg++ levels in the range of 4 to 5.5 mg/dl are easily maintained. This treatment does not interfere with neurological assessment, administration of anesthesia during surgery, or other aspects of clinical care. We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level. A larger study is needed to evaluate this trend further.",

OBJECTIVE: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) type 2 presenting with predominant hand involvement, also known as CMT2D and Silver syndrome (SS) are rare phenotypically overlapping diseases which can be caused by mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) and in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase encoding (GARS) genes. Mutations in the heat-shock proteins HSPB1 and HSPB8 can cause related distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) and are considered candidates for dHMN-V, CMT2, and SS. DESIGN: To define the frequency and distribution of mutations in the GARS, BSCL2, HSPB1 and HSPB8 genes we screened 33 unrelated sporadic and familial patients diagnosed as either dHMN-V, CMT2D or SS. Exon 3 of the BSCL2 gene was screened in further 69 individuals with an unclassified dHMN phenotype or diagnosed as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) complicated by pure motor neuropathy. RESULTS: Four patients diagnosed with dHMN-V or SS carried known heterozygous BSCL2 mutations (N88S and S90L). In one dHMN-V patient we detected a putative GARS mutation (A57V). No mutations were detected in HSPB1 and HSPB8. The diagnostic yield gained in the series of 33 probands was 12% for BSCL2 mutations and 3% for GARS mutations. In the series of unclassified dHMN and complicated HSP cases no mutations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that most likely only two mutations (N88S, S90L) in exon 3 of BSCL2 may lead to dHMN-V or SS phenotypes. Mutations in GARS, HSPB1 and HSPB8. are not a common cause of dHMN-V, SS and CMT2D. We would therefore suggest that a genetic testing of dHMN-V and SS patients should begin with screening of exon 3 of the BSCL2 gene. Screening of the GARS gene is useful in patients with CMT2 with predominant hand involvement and dHMN-V. The rather low frequencies of BSCL2, GARS, HSPB1 and HSPB8 mutations in dHMN-V, CMT2D and SS patients strongly point to further genetic heterogeneity of these related disorders.",

In this study, we took advantage of the overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) in prostate cancers to design lentiviruses with modified envelope proteins that bind antibodies to specific cell-surface antigens. When bound to trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, CA), lentiviruses were able to selectively infect androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant C4-2 human prostate cancer cell lines, both of which express high levels of HER-2. To test for a therapeutic effect, we engineered our antibody-binding lentiviruses to express thymidine kinase, which can convert the non-toxic pro-drug ganciclovir (GCV) into a cytotoxic form. LNCaP and C4-2 cells infected by these viruses were sensitive to GCV killing. In vivo, C4-2 xenograft tumors treated either intratumorally or i.v. with trastuzumab-bound lentivirus expressed luciferase, although the latter route was less tumor specific. When a prostate-specific promoter for governing luciferase expression was combined with trastuzumab-mediated delivery, there was a further enrichment in targeting viral gene expression in prostate tumors. In conclusion, we found that although prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by viruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind this antibody.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a relatively rare cause of stroke with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, primarily due to the occurrence of delayed vasospasm. To date, many therapies have been proposed to help prevent vasospasm, but very few have been proven effective. The initiation of statin therapy after SAH may be effective in reducing the incidence of vasospasm; however, the only studies that have examined this effect have been small. This meta-analysis attempted to determine whether statins reduce morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal SAH. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized, controlled trials relating to the use of statins in SAH. Foreign language and abstract articles were included. Two independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction, and quality. Primary outcome was the incidence of radiographically confirmed clinical vasospasm; secondary outcomes were incidence of delayed ischemic deficits and mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of vasospasm (relative risk [RR]=0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99), delayed ischemic deficits (RR=0.38; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.83), and mortality (RR=0.22; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.82) were significantly reduced in the statin group. For these outcomes, we calculated a number needed to treat of 6.25, 5, and 6.7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of statin therapy after aneurysmal SAH significantly reduces the incidence of vasospasm, delayed ischemic deficits, and mortality. This is consistent with animal research and retrospective studies and supports the routine use of statins in the care of patients with aneurysmal SAH.",

Other aspects of the MWS behavioral phenotype are suggestive of a happy affect and sociable demeanor. Despite this, those with MWS displayed similarly high levels of behavioral problems as those with intellectual disabilities from other causes, with over 30% showing clinically significant levels of behavioral or emotional disturbance.

Despite strong prospective epidemiology and mechanistic evidence for the benefits of certain micronutrients in preventing CVD, neutral and negative outcomes from secondary intervention trials have undermined the efficacy of supplemental nutrition in preventing CVD. In contrast, evidence for the positive impact of specific diets in CVD prevention, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, has focused attention on the potential benefits of whole diets and specific dietary patterns. These patterns have been scored on the basis of current guidelines for the prevention of CVD, to provide a quantitative evaluation of the relationship between diet and disease. Using this approach, large prospective studies have reported reductions in CVD risk ranging from 10 to 60% in groups whose diets can be variously classified as \u2018Healthy\u2019, \u2018Prudent\u2019, Mediterranean\u2019 or \u2018DASH compliant\u2019. Evaluation of the relationship between dietary score and risk biomarkers has also been informative with respect to underlying mechanisms. However, although this analysis may appear to validate whole-diet approaches to disease prevention, it must be remembered that the classification of dietary scores is based on current understanding of diet - disease relationships, which may be incomplete or erroneous. Of particular concern is the limited number of high-quality intervention studies of whole diets, which include disease endpoints as the primary outcome. The aims of this review are to highlight the limitations of dietary guidelines based on nutrient-specific data, and the persuasive evidence for the benefits of whole dietary patterns on CVD risk. It also makes a plea for more randomised controlled trials, which are designed to support food and whole dietary-based approaches for preventing CVD.",

Replication-selective tumor-specific viruses present a novel approach for treatment of neoplastic disease. These vectors are designed to induce virus-mediated lysis of tumor cells after selective viral propagation within the tumor. For targeting cancer cells, there is a need for tissue- or cell-specific promoters that can express in diverse tumor types and are silent in normal cells. Recent advances in molecular biology have fostered remarkable insights into the molecular basis of neoplasm. Telomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in carcinogenesis and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. Since only tumor cells that express telomerase activity would activate this promoter, the hTERT proximal promoter allows for preferential expression of viral genes in tumor cells, leading to selective viral replication. We constructed an attenuated adenovirus 5 vector (Telomelysin, OBP-301), in which the hTERT promoter element drives expression of E1A and E1B genes linked with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Telomelysin replicated efficiently and induced marked cell killing in a panel of human cancer cell lines, whereas replication as well as cytotoxicity was highly attenuated in normal human cells lacking telomerase activity. Thus, the hTERT promoter confers competence for selective replication of Telomelysin in human cancer cells, an outcome that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers. This article reviews recent findings in this rapidly evolving field: cancer therapeutic and cancer diagnostic approaches using the hTERT promoter.",

LDB1 (LIM-domain-binding 1) is a cofactor that participates in formation of transcriptional regulatory complexes involving transcription factors containing LIM domains as well as other factors. The amount of LDB1 protein in cells has previously been shown to be modulated by RNF12 (RING finger protein 12). RNF12 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can target LDB1 for poly-ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. We find that in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells expression of RNF12 leads to mono-ubiquitination of LDB1 and increased levels of LDB1 protein. Mutagenesis studies identified Lys134 of LDB1 as the residue that is mono-ubiquitinated by RNF12. Mutation of Lys134 of LDB1 to arginine blocks the formation of mono-ubiquitinated LDB1 and surprisingly also increases LDB1 protein expression in HEK-293 cells. This leads to a model in which Lys134 of LDB1 can be either mono-ubiquitinated, leading to stabilization, or poly-ubiquitinated, leading to degradation by the proteasome pathway. We also find that ubiquitin-LDB1 fusion proteins are stabilized in HEK-293 cells, offering further evidence that mono-ubiquitination stabilizes LDB1 in these cells. Expression in Xenopus laevis embryos of an LDB1 protein in which Lys134 is replaced with arginine leads to enhanced expression of the mutant protein as compared with the wild-type protein. These findings provide evidence that modification of Lys134 can play a major role in regulating LDB1 expression.",

OBJECTIVE: To summarize concepts of cell depletion and myeloablation studied in the context of neuroimmunological disorders. METHOD: Evaluation of the available literature on multiple sclerosis as the most widely studied neuroimmunological entity. RESULTS: Three concepts have been introduced: classical immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide exert general lymphopenic effects and thereby moderately decrease disease activity. Myeloablative regimens combined with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a profound and in most cases long-lasting impact on autoimmunity at the cost of potentially life-threatening side effects. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52), rituximab and ocrelizumab (both anti-CD20) are depleting antibodies directed against certain lymphocyte subsets and substantially ameliorate disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds soluble forms of amyloid and in preclinical studies promoted its clearance from the brain. METHODS: In two phase 3, double-blind trials (EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2), we randomly assigned 1012 and 1040 patients, respectively, with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease to receive placebo or solanezumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg) every 4 weeks for 18 months. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline to week 80 in scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11; range, 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL; range, 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse functioning). After analysis of data from EXPEDITION 1, the primary outcome for EXPEDITION 2 was revised to the change in scores on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater impairment), in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Neither study showed significant improvement in the primary outcomes. The modeled difference between groups (solanezumab group minus placebo group) in the change from baseline was -0.8 points for the ADAS-cog11 score (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 0.5; P=0.24) and -0.4 points for the ADCS-ADL score (95% CI, -2.3 to 1.4; P=0.64) in EXPEDITION 1 and -1.3 points (95% CI, -2.5 to 0.3; P=0.06) and 1.6 points (95% CI, -0.2 to 3.3; P=0.08), respectively, in EXPEDITION 2. Between-group differences in the changes in the ADAS-cog14 score were -1.7 points in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (95% CI, -3.5 to 0.1; P=0.06) and -1.5 in patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (95% CI, -4.1 to 1.1; P=0.26).

Weight gain occurs no matter what the patient's age, sex, or race and is seen with both oral and depot drug formulations. Numerous studies have found that patients gain weight when treated with a conventional antipsychotic, such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, and haloperidol. The newer, novel antipsychotics offer advantages over conventional antipsychotics, especially a relative lack of extrapyramidal symptoms, but some still have the disadvantage of causing weight gain. Clozapine and olanzapine in particular appear to cause substantial weight gain, much more so than do most conventional neuroleptics and novel agents such as risperidone. Given the risks to health and treatment compliance associated with weight gain and obesity, clinicians should monitor weight during the course of antipsychotic therapy and consider switching agents if excessive weight gain occurs.",

To evaluate TRH as a treatment for cancer-related fatigue, an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study of breast cancer patients has been initiated and this report presents preliminary observations conducted with three of these patients over 4 consecutive weeks, thereby involving a total of six TRH treatments and six saline controls. Global assessment using both subjective and objective parameters showed that TRH exerted clear anti-fatigue effects in four of the six TRH treatments. These responses were rapid in onset and persisted through the 24 h observation period. No anti-fatigue responses were seen in five of the six saline controls. No unexpected side-effects were seen with TRH administration. These initial findings support the proposal that TRH can ameliorate cancer-related fatigue.",

After acute exposure of cells to arsenic, reactive oxygen species mediate changes in cell behavior, including activation of proliferative signaling. For chronic exposure to arsenic, however, the function of reactive oxygen species in cell transformation remains poorly understood. Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis, its functions and molecular mechanisms in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis are unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if miR-21 is involved in arsenite-induced malignant transformation and to characterize the associated signaling pathways. During arsenite-induced transformation of human embryo lung fibroblast (HELF) cells, miR-21 was upregulated, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signal pathway was activated. Moreover, superoxide radical dismutase (a scavenger of superoxide) and catalase (a scavenger of hydroperoxides) blocked the arsenite-induced effects in HELF cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Blockage of ERK by the inhibitor U0126 or inhibition of NF-\u03baB p65 by siRNA or Bay 11-7082 prevented the increases in miR-21 and the decreases in Spry1, Pten, and Pdcd4, the target proteins of miR-21, induced by arsenite. As determined by a ChIP-qPCR assay, NF-\u03baB p65 regulated miR-21 expression by binding directly to the promoter of miR-21. Further, anti-miR-21 downregulated miR-21 expression and prevented the arsenite-induced activation of ERK via the increase in Spry1, indicating that miR-21 has a feedback effect in regulating ERK activation. Overexpression of miR-21 with an miR-21 mimic and feedback activation of ERK and NF-\u03baB via the decrease in Spry1 promoted the malignancy of HELF cells exposed to arsenite, but knockdown of miR-21 with anti-miR-21 and feedback blockage of ERK and NF-\u03baB activation through an increase in Spry1 decreased anchorage-independent growth of arsenite-transformed cells. Thus, the transformation of HELF cells induced by chronic exposure to arsenite is mediated by increased miR-21 expression, which, in turn, is mediated by reactive oxygen species activation of the ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway.",

For comparison with Atg proteins in higher eukaryotes, also an analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens databases was included. This analysis demonstrated that Atg proteins required for non-selective macroautophagy are conserved from yeast to man, stressing the importance of this process in cell survival and viability. The A. thaliana and human genomes encode multiple proteins highly similar to specific fungal Atg proteins (paralogs), possibly representing cell type-specific isoforms. The Atg proteins specifically involved in the Cvt pathway and/or pexophagy showed poor conservation, and were generally not present in A. thaliana and man. Furthermore, Atg19, the receptor of Cvt cargo, was only detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nevertheless, Atg11, a protein that links receptor-bound cargo (peroxisomes, the Cvt complex) to the autophagic machinery was identified in all yeast species and filamentous fungi under study.

Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the contractile consequences of these subtle amino acid substitutions remain obscure. To decipher them, in the present study, we originally recorded and analysed the mechanics as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns of human membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibres with a particular peptide substitution in actin, i.e. p.Phe352Ser. Results unravelled an unexpected cascade of molecular and cellular events. During contraction, p.Phe352Ser greatly enhances the strain of individual cross-bridges. Paradoxically, p.Phe352Ser also slightly lowers the number of cross-bridges by altering the rate of myosin head attachment to actin monomers.

Although just 10 kb apart and responsive to the same signals, the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes are nevertheless regulated independently by separate, tissue-specific enhancers. To understand the differential regulation of the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes we have investigated a cluster of three ubiquitous DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) located between the two genes. We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo. The positioning of these sites relative to the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes and their respective enhancers is conserved between human and mouse, suggesting a functional role in the organization of the locus. We found that these sites effectively block functional interactions between the GM-CSF enhancer and either the IL-3 or the GM-CSF promoter in reporter gene assays. These data argue that the regulation of the IL-3 and the GM-CSF promoters depends on the positions of their enhancers relative to the conserved CTCF/cohesin-binding sites. We suggest that one important role of these sites is to enable the independent regulation of the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes.",

We have characterized biochemically, morphologically, and genetically two distinct pathways for the selective degradation of peroxisomes in Pichia pastoris. These pathways are independently regulated and analogous to microautophagy and macroautophagy that have been defined in mammalian cells. When P. pastoris is grown in methanol, cytosolic and peroxisomal enzymes necessary for methanol assimilation are synthesized. During adaptation from methanol to glucose, these enzymes are rapidly and selectively degraded within the yeast vacuole by microautophagy. We have isolated gsa mutants that are defective in glucose-induced selective autophagy of peroxisomes. In this study, we have shown that gsa1 is unable to sequester peroxisomes into the yeast vacuole. In addition, we provide evidence that the glucose-induced selective autophagy 1 (GSA1) protein is the alpha subunit of the phosphofructokinase enzyme complex encoded by PFK1. First, we can rescue the gsa1 mutant by transformation with a vector containing PFK1. Second, cellular levels of both PFK1 mRNA and phosphofructokinase activity are dramatically reduced in gsa1 when compared to the parental GS115. Third, a PFK1 knockout (delta pfk1) is unable to degrade alcohol oxidase during glucose adaptation. As observed in gsa1, the peroxisomes in delta pfk1 remain outside the vacuole during adaptation. Our data are consistent with the concept that PFK1 protein is required for an event upstream of vacuole degradation (i.e. signaling, selection, or sequestration). However, the degradation of peroxisomes does not require a catalytically active phosphofructokinase. The inability of delta pfk1 cells to degrade alcohol oxidase can be rescued by transformation with either normal PFK1 or mutant pfk1 whose catalytic site had been inactivated by a single amino acid mutation. We propose that PFK1 protein directly modulates glucose-induced microautophagy independent of its ability to metabolize glucose intermediates.",

AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare the efficacy, tolerance, and perception of a fixed proprietary combination (Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2%) vs. tretinoin 0.025% cream in women with photoaged skin. MATERIAL/METHODS: In this randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled clinical study, women applied to the entire face for 3\u00a0months in the morning a SPF 50 sunscreen and in the evening either the association of Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% or tretinoin 0.025%. Clinical and instrumental parameters were assessed at days 0, 28, 56, and 84.

RESULTS: A total of 120 women (60 to Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% cream and 60 to tretinoin 0.025% cream) were included in the study. Both products improved considerably wrinkles, mottled pigmentation, pores, and global photodamage. No statistically significant differences were noted between Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% cream and tretinoin 0.025% cream. Adverse effects were mostly graded mild.

The efficacy, side effects (SE) profile and cost of PGB and GBP in neuropathic pain states were reviewed with special reference to sciatica. Eleven articles matched the criteria: seven systematic reviews, one retrospective cross-sectional study, one placebo-controlled-crossover study, one randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study and one case report. GBP and PGB appeared to demonstrate comparable efficacy and SE. However, the amount and quality of evidence was low, and only indirect comparisons were available. Importantly, no direct \"head-to-head\" study existed. Globally, costs varied widely (by up to 31 times) and unpredictably (PGB cheaper than GBP, or vice versa). Formulary regulator rulings were globally disparate; however, many exclusively favoured the more expensive drug (whether GBP or PGB). No studies assessed PGB-GBP interchange. Weak evidence suggests that efficacy and SE with GBP and PGB are probably similar; however, firm conclusions are precluded. Despite weak data, and having cited minor titration, but definite cost, advantages, UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence favoured PGB over GBP.

BACKGROUND: After age, the second largest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, where APOE4 is associated with lower apoE protein levels, more severer brain pathology, enhanced inflammation and disease. Small peptides corresponding to the receptor-binding region of apoE mimic the anti-inflammatory activity of the apoE holoprotein. These apoE mimetics greatly improve behavioral outcomes and neuronal survival in head trauma models that display AD pathology and neuronal loss. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether apoE mimetics change behavior, inflammation and pathology in CVND-AD (SwDI-APP/NOS2(-/-)) transgenic mice. METHODS: Starting at 9 months, apoE peptides were subcutaneously administered 3 times per week for 3 months followed by behavioral, histochemical and biochemical testing. RESULTS: Treatment with apoE mimetics significantly improved behavior while decreasing the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, neurofibrillary tangle-like and amyloid plaque-like structures. Biochemical measures matched the visible pathological results. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with apoE mimetics significantly improved behavior, reduced inflammation and reduced pathology in CVND-AD mice. These improvements are associated with apoE-mimetic-mediated increases in protein phosphatase 2A activity. Testing in additional AD models showed similar benefits, reinforcing this novel mechanism of action of apoE mimetics.

OBJECTIVE: This randomised, double-blind, 12-week study compared efficacy and tolerability of flexible-dose treatment with vortioxetine(10-20 mg/day) versus agomelatine (25-50 mg/day) in major depressive disorder patients with inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) monotherapy. METHODS: Patients were switched directly from SSRI/SNRI to vortioxetine or agomelatine. Primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 8 in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score analysed by mixed model for repeated measurements, using a noninferiority test followed by a superiority test. Secondary endpoints included response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Clinical Global Impression, overall functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), health-related quality of life(EuroQol 5 Dimensions), productivity (work limitation questionnaire) and family functioning (Depression and Family Functioning Scale). RESULTS: Primary endpoint noninferiority was established and vortioxetine (n = 252) was superior to agomelatine (n = 241) by 2.2 MADRS points (p<0.01). Vortioxetine was also significantly superior in response and remission rates at weeks 8 and 12; MADRS, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, Sheehan Disability Scale and EuroQol 5 Dimensions scores at week 4 onwards; work limitation questionnaire at week 8 and Depression and Family Functioning Scale at weeks 8 and 12. Fewer patients withdrew because of adverse events with vortioxetine (5.9% vs 9.5%). Adverse events (incidence > 5%) were nausea, headache, dizziness and somnolence. CONCLUSIONS: Vortioxetine was noninferior and significantly superior to agomelatine in major depressive disorder patients with previous inadequate response to a single course of SSRI/SNRI monotherapy. Vortioxetine was safe and well tolerated.",

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. METHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum eosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were instructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled glucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for 12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary end point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points included a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52 patients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with dupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction with dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28; P<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung function and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with Th2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and headache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when LABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) exhibits complex genetics with incomplete penetrance and variable severity thought to result as a consequence of multiple gene interactions that modulate the ability of enteric neural crest cells to populate the developing gut. As reported previously, when the same null mutation of the Ednrb gene, Ednrb(sl), was introgressed into the F344 strain, almost 60% of F344-Ednrb(sl/sl) pups did not show any symptoms of aganglionosis, appearing healthy and normally fertile. These findings strongly suggested that the severity of HSCR was affected by strain-specific genetic factor (s). In this study, the genetic basis of such large strain differences in the severity of aganglionosis in the rat model was studied by whole-genome scanning for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using an intercross of (AGH-Ednrb(sl)\u00d7F344-Ednrb(sl)) F(1) with the varying severity of aganglionosis. Genome linkage analysis identified one significant QTL on chromosome 2 for the severity of aganglionosis. Our QTL analyses using rat models of HSCR revealed that multiple genetic factors regulated the severity of aganglionosis. Moreover, a known HSCR susceptibility gene, Gdnf, was found in QTL that suggested a novel non-coding sequence mutation in GDNF that modifies the penetrance and severity of the aganglionosis phenotype in EDNRB-deficient rats. A further identification and analysis of responsible genes located on the identified QTL could lead to the richer understanding of the genetic basis of HSCR development.",

UNLABELLED: Mulibrey nanism (MUL) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with severe primordial growth retardation and multiorgan involvement, caused by mutations in TRIM37. Early clinical detection is important since more than 50 % of the patients develop congestive heart failure. We report a 12-year-old patient who presented in infancy with severe growth retardation, dysmorphic features, and cleft palate. Clinical diagnosis of MUL was established at the age of 5 years. Postmortem, molecular diagnostic confirmed MUL as a novel 1-bp deletion (c.1233delA) in exon 14 of the TRIM37 coding region. Cardiac examination at the age of 6 years revealed constrictive pericarditis with significant elevation of atrial filling pressures, consecutive hepatomegaly, and protein loosing enteropathy. Since the parents refused pericardectomy, surgery was delayed until the age of 12 years, when congestive heart failure deteriorated. Despite pericardectomy, the boy died from persistent right heart failure. CONCLUSION: Our report underlines the necessity of early clinical diagnosis of Mulibrey nanism. Careful cardiologic examination is required to detect constrictive pericarditis, which is a major factor of mortality in these patients. Pericardectomy should be performed early, to avoid sequelae of persisting congestive heart failure.",

We report here a novel post-transcriptional modification, acetylation, of PML. PML exists as an acetylated protein in HeLa cells, and its acetylation is enhanced by coexpression of p300 or treatment with a HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A.

Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. Although most of these elements share little sequence identity to each other, a small number are remarkably similar and appear to be the product of duplication events. Here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with Fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences. We identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes. In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family, thus removing much of the ambiguity in identifying associated genes. We find that duplicate elements have the potential to up-regulate reporter gene expression in a tissue-specific manner and that expression domains often overlap, but are not necessarily identical, between family members. Over two thirds of the families are conserved in duplicate in fish and appear to predate the large-scale duplication events thought to have occurred at the origin of vertebrates. We propose a model whereby gene duplication and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements can be considered in the context of increased morphological diversity and the emergence of the modern vertebrate body plan.",

B cells are increasingly regarded as integral to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, in part as a result of the success of B cell-depletion therapy. Multiple B cell-dependent mechanisms contributing to inflammatory demyelination of the CNS have been explored using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4 T cell-dependent animal model for multiple sclerosis. Although B cell Ag presentation was suggested to regulate CNS inflammation during EAE, direct evidence that B cells can independently support Ag-specific autoimmune responses by CD4 T cells in EAE is lacking. Using a newly developed murine model of in vivo conditional expression of MHC class II, we reported previously that encephalitogenic CD4 T cells are incapable of inducing EAE when B cells are the sole APC. In this study, we find that B cells cooperate with dendritic cells to enhance EAE severity resulting from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization. Further, increasing the precursor frequency of MOG-specific B cells, but not the addition of soluble MOG-specific Ab, is sufficient to drive EAE in mice expressing MHCII by B cells alone. These data support a model in which expansion of Ag-specific B cells during CNS autoimmunity amplifies cognate interactions between B and CD4 T cells and have the capacity to independently drive neuroinflammation at later stages of disease.",

Glioblastoma is a devastating primary brain tumor resistant to conventional therapies. In this study, we tested the efficacy of combining temozolomide with curcumin, a phytochemical known to inhibit glioblastoma growth, and investigated the mechanisms involved. The data showed that synergy between curcumin and temozolomide was not achieved due to redundant mechanisms that lead to activating protective autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Autophagy preceded apoptosis, and blocking this response with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyl-adenine, ATG7 siRNA and chloroquine) rendered cells susceptible to temozolomide and curcumin alone or combinations by increasing apoptosis. While curcumin inhibited STAT3, NF\u03baB and PI3K/Akt to affect survival, temozolomide-induced autophagy relied on the DNA damage response and repair components ATM and MSH6, as well as p38 and JNK1/2. However, the most interesting observation was that both temozolomide and curcumin required ERK1/2 to induce autophagy. Blocking this ERK1/2-mediated temozolomide and curcumin induced autophagy with resveratrol, a blood-brain barrier permeable drug, improved temozolomide/curcumin efficacy in brain-implanted tumors. Overall, the data presented demonstrate that autophagy impairs the efficacy of temozolomide/curcumin, and inhibiting this phenomenon could provide novel opportunities to improve brain tumor treatment.",

The analysis of chromatin structure is essential for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. The subnucleosome-sized MPE-seq peaks exhibit a particularly distinct association with active promoters. In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. In this regard, we found that DNA sequences at RNA splice sites are hypersensitive to digestion by MNase but not by MPE-Fe(II). This phenomenon may have affected the analysis of nucleosome occupancy over exons. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. In particular, the combined use of MPE-seq and MNase-seq enables the identification of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the regulation of gene expression.",

INTRODUCTION: The safety and tolerability profiles of antidepressants can often influence the treatment choices of clinicians treating major depressive disorder. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the safety and tolerability of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) in treating depression. METHODS: An integrated analysis of all short-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration studies for major depressive disorder (four flexible-dose and five fixed-dose studies) was performed. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and discontinuation symptoms were evaluated. In the subset of fixed-dose studies, dose-related effects were analyzed. RESULTS: In the overall population (placebo: n=1,116; desvenlafaxine: n=1,834), adverse events resulted in discontinuations in 3% of placebo-treated patients and 12% of desvenlafaxine-treated patients; in the subset of fixed-dose studies, the rates were 4% with placebo and increased with desvenlafaxine dose (50 mg/day: 4%; 400 mg/day: 18%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was transient nausea that was generally mild to moderate. The most common sexual dysfunction associated with desvenlafaxine treatment was erectile dysfunction in men (7% vs 1% with placebo) and anorgasmia in women (1% and 0%). One desvenlafaxine-treated patient died of a completed suicide; there were four suicide attempts (three desvenlafaxine, one placebo) and eight cases of suicidal ideation (five desvenlafaxine, three placebo) during the on-therapy period. Small but statistically significant changes in mean blood pressure occurred at all desvenlafaxine doses; clinically meaningful changes were observed in 1% of placebo-treated patients and 2% of desvenlafaxine-treated patients. Desvenlafaxine was associated with small but statistically significant mean changes in laboratory assessments, particularly lipid and liver enzyme elevations, and electrocardiograms; few cases of these changes were clinically relevant. CONCLUSION: Desvenlafaxine in the treatment of major depressive disorder exhibited a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor class. The most common adverse event was transient nausea. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo.",

The hypocholesterolemic effect of tomato juice has been investigated in an intervention study with rats, along with the possible inhibition effect of bioactive tomato compounds binding to the HMGCR enzyme. Two experimental groups (n = 8 Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed ad libitum for five weeks, with water or tomato juice provided to the control and intervention groups, respectively. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and total triglycerides were analysed in plasma, and the lycopene content and the expression and activity of the enzyme HMGCR were determined in liver samples. A computational molecular modelling was carried out to determine the interactions between HMGCR and lycopene, chlorogenic acid and naringenin. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice. In addition, a significant reduction in HMGCR activity was observed, although this was not accompanied by changes in gene expression. The molecular modelling showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR.",

OBJECTIVES: Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. We undertook a phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of alemtuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of eight patients were enrolled, seven with mycosis fungoides/S\u00e9zary syndrome (MF/SS) and one with large-cell transformation of MF. Seven patients had disease refractory to multiple previous therapies. Alemzumab (30 mg) was administered intravenously three times per week for 12 wk or until maximum response. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 38%, with three patients achieving partial remission, two patients with stable disease and three patients with progressive disease (PD) during treatment. The time to progression was short, with all patients developing PD within 4 months of starting alemtuzumab. Response duration in the three PR patients was also brief, with responses lasting less than 3 months in all three cases. Significant hematological and immunosuppressive toxicity was observed, with both grade 3-4 cytopenias and significant infectious complications occurring in a majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in heavily pretreated, refractory, advanced stage MF/SS, although alemtuzumab has biological activity, it is associated with significant toxicity and only modest clinical utility. As such, combination regimens incorporating alemtuzumab merit further investigation in this difficult to treat patient group.",

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is thought to result as a consequence of multiple gene interactions that modulate the ability of enteric neural crest cells to populate the developing gut. However, it remains unknown whether the single complete deletion of important HSCR-associated genes is sufficient to result in HSCR disease. In this study, we found that the null mutation of the Ednrb gene, thought indispensable for enteric neuron development, is insufficient to result in HSCR disease when bred onto a different genetic background in rats carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations. Moreover, we found that this mutation results in serious congenital sensorineural deafness, and these strains may be used as ideal models of Waardenburg Syndrome Type 4 (WS4). Furthermore, we evaluated how the same changed genetic background modifies three features of WS4 syndrome, aganglionosis, hearing loss, and pigment disorder in these congenic strains. We found that the same genetic background markedly changed the aganglionosis, but resulted in only slight changes to hearing loss and pigment disorder. This provided the important evidence, in support of previous studies, that different lineages of neural crest-derived cells migrating along with various pathways are regulated by different signal molecules.

Successful germline transmission of the exogenous gene was also confirmed. Expression of the GFP gene reverted to the pre-induction levels when doxycycline was removed from the diet.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is caused by mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gene. Almost all RTH patients are heterozygous with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. That most are clinically euthyroid suggests a compensatory role of the TR alpha1 isoform in maintaining the normal functions of thyroid hormone (T3) in these patients. To understand the role of TR alpha1 in the manifestation of RTH, we compared the phenotypes of mice with a targeted dominantly negative mutant TR beta (TR betaPV) with or without TR alpha1. TR betaPV mice faithfully recapitulate RTH in humans in that these mice demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary-thyroid axis and impairment in growth. Here we show that the dysregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis was worsened by the lack of TR alpha1 in TR betaPV mice, and severe impairment of postnatal growth was manifested in TR betaPV mice deficient in TR alpha1. Furthermore, abnormal expression patterns of T3-target genes in TR betaPV mice were altered by the lack of TR alpha1. These results demonstrate that the lack of TR alpha1 exacerbates the manifestation of RTH in TR betaPV mice. Therefore, TR alpha1 could play a compensatory role in mediating the functions of T3 in heterozygous patients with RTH. This compensatory role may be especially crucial for postnatal growth.",

BACKGROUND: Neither the presence nor prevalence of enteric hyperoxaluria has been recognized after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). We have noted a high rate of oxalate nephrolithiasis and even 2 patients with oxalate nephropathy in this patient population postoperatively. Our aim was to determine the frequency of the occurrence and effects of enteric hyperoxaluria after RYGBP. METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients at our institution diagnosed with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis or oxalate nephropathy after standard (n = 14) or distal (n = 9) RYGBP. The mean postoperative follow-up was 55 months. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients (14 men and 9 women; mean age 45 years; mean preoperative body mass index 55 kg/m(2)) developed enteric hyperoxaluria after RYGBP, defined by the presence of oxalate nephropathy (n = 2) or calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis (n = 21) and increased 24-hour excretion of urinary oxalate and/or calcium oxalate supersaturation. Enteric hyperoxaluria was recognized after a mean weight loss of 46 kg at 29 months (range 2-85) after RYGBP. Two patients developed renal failure and required chronic hemodialysis. Of the 21 patients with nephrolithiasis, 14 had no history of nephrolithiasis preoperatively, and 19 of 21 required lithotripsy or other intervention. Of the 23 patients, 20 tested had increased oxalate excretion, and 14 of 15 tested had high urine calcium oxalate supersaturation. CONCLUSION: Enteric hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, and oxalate nephropathy must be considered with the other risks of RYGBP.

AIMS: To investigate whether genetic variants of the histidine-rich calcium (HRC)-binding protein are associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and its progression. METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened 123 idiopathic DCM patients and 96 healthy individuals by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing for genetic variants in HRC. Six polymorphisms were detected: Leu35Leu (A/G), Ser43Asn (G/A), Ser96Ala (T/G), Glu202_Glu203insGlu (-/GAG), Asp261del (GAT/-), and an in-frame insertion of 51 amino acids at His321. The analysis of their frequencies did not reveal any significant correlation with DCM development. However, the Ser96Ala polymorphism exhibited a statistically significant correlation with the occurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. During a follow-up of 4.02 +/- 2.4 years, the risk for ventricular arrhythmias was higher (HR, 9.620; 95% CI, 2.183-42.394; P = 0.003) in the Ala/Ala patients, compared with Ser/Ser homozygous patients. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, the Ser96Ala polymorphism was the only significant genetic arrythmogenesis predictor in DCM patients (HR, 4.191; 95% CI, 0.838-20.967; P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM.",

Today there exists only one FDA-approved treatment for ischemic stroke; i.e., the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). In the aftermath of the failed stroke clinical trials with the nitrone spin trap/radical scavenger, NXY-059, a number of articles raised the question: are we doing the right thing? Is the animal research truly translational in identifying new agents for stroke treatment? This review summarizes the current state of affairs with plasminogen activators in thrombolytic therapy. In addition to therapeutic value, potential side effects of tPA also exist that aggravate stroke injury and offset the benefits provided by reperfusion of the occluded artery. Thus, combinational options (ultrasound alone or with microspheres/nanobubbles, mechanical dissociation of clot, activated protein C (APC), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), neuroserpin and CDP-choline) that could offset tPA toxic side effects and improve efficacy are also discussed here. Desmoteplase, a plasminogen activator derived from the saliva of Desmodus rotundus vampire bat, antagonizes vascular tPA-induced neurotoxicity by competitively binding to low-density lipoprotein related-receptors (LPR) at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) interface, minimizing the tPA uptake into brain parenchyma. tPA can also activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of endopeptidases comprised of 24 mammalian enzymes that primarily catalyze the turnover and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs have been implicated in BBB breakdown and neuronal injury in the early times after stroke, but also contribute to vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, neurogenesis and axonal regeneration during the later repair phase after stroke. tPA, directly or by activation of MMP-9, could have beneficial effects on recovery after stroke by promoting neurovascular repair through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, any treatment regimen directed at MMPs must consider their pleiotropic nature and the likelihood of either beneficial or detrimental effects that might depend on the timing of the treatment in relation to the stage of brain injury.",

Previous evidence suggests that epipodophyllotoxins, such as etoposide and teniposide, and the N-acyl anthracycline AD41 inhibit topoisomerase II resealing even though they apparently do not bind to DNA. Using experimental conditions designed to detect limited numbers of DNA binding sites, we now report that both epipodophyllotoxins and the N-acyl anthracyclines AD41 and AD32 bind to DNA. Binding was greater to kinetoplast DNA than to pUC18 plasmid DNA. There was also greater etoposide binding to single-stranded DNA than to double-stranded linear or supercoiled DNA. Based on binding competition experiments, etoposide and teniposide appear to have equal affinity for DNA, in spite of the fact that the latter is more potent as a topoisomerase inhibitor. This suggests that the difference in the drugs relates to protein interaction. There are 3- to 7-fold more binding sites for AD41 than for AD32, depending on the DNA substrate employed, and both drugs, unlike adriamycin, exhibit saturation of binding sites over a concentration range of 0-50 microM when kinetoplast DNA is the substrate. Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects.",

Review of literature reveals initial case series with similar, successful results using propranolol as an adjuvant treatment along with other medications and surgical interventions. We conclude that the initial use of propranolol as the sole treatment for infantile airway hemangioma is promising. Literature review reveals that propranolol as the sole treatment for most head and neck hemangiomas shows significant promise based on early case reports. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effectiveness, dosing strategies, and side effect profile of propranolol treatment for hemangiomas.",

The expression of variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) correlates with the metastatic potential of various carcinomas. In endometrial cancer, however, the significance of CD44v-expression as a prognostic indicator has not been fully investigated, nor has it been compared with that of p53, estrogen receptor or Ki67. Surgical material consisted of 14 atypical endometrial hyperplasias (AEH) and 163 endometrial carcinomas (EC). Expression of CD44s, v3 and v6 in carcinoma tissue, and other prognostic markers were immunohistochemically evaluated. The expression in the squamous differentiation was strictly excluded for the evaluation of immunohistochemistry, because the significance was different from that in the adenocarcinoma component. CD44s was frequently expressed in AEH and EC. On the other hand, CD44v3- and v6-positivities were rare or nonexistent in AEH, but were observed in 8 and 35% of EC, respectively. CD44v3-expression correlated significantly with histologic grade and lymph node metastasis. However, there was no correlation between CD44v6 expression and any clinicopathologic factor, nor were other prognostic markers expressed. Univariate analysis revealed that each CD44 was a prognostic determinant in the patients with EC. However, employing multivariate analysis, there were only three independent factors: p53 overexpression, CD44v6 expression and myometrial invasion. CD44v6 expression in the adenocarcinoma component may directly affect the behavior of carcinoma and the prognosis of patients with EC.",

OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has been developed for the detection of fetal aneuploidy. Clinical trials have shown high sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 (T21) in both high-risk and average-risk populations. Although its great potential for prenatal medicine is evident, more information regarding the consequences of implementing NIPT in a national programme for prenatal screening is required. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of current clinical practice in The Netherlands using conventional screening only, with two alternatives: implementing NIPT as an optional secondary screening test for those pregnancies complicated by a high risk for T21, and implementing NIPT as primary screening test, replacing conventional screening. Probability estimates were derived from a systematic review of international literature. Costs were determined from a health-care perspective. Data were analysed to obtain outcomes, total costs, relative costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the different strategies. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of assumptions on model results. RESULTS: Implementing NIPT as an optional secondary, or as primary screening test will increase T21 detection rate by 36% (from 46.8% to 63.5%) and 54% (from 46.8% to 72.0%), simultaneously decreasing the average risk of procedure-related miscarriage by 44% (from 0.0168% to 0.0094% per pregnant woman) and 62% (from 0.0168% to 0.0064% per pregnant woman), respectively. None of the strategies clearly dominated: current clinical practice is the least costly, whereas implementing NIPT will cause total costs of the programme to increase by 21% (from \u20ac257.09 to \u20ac311.74 per pregnant woman), leading to an ICER of k\u20ac94 per detected case of T21, when utilised as an optional secondary screening test and by 157% (from \u20ac257.09 to \u20ac660.94 per pregnant woman), leading to an ICER of k\u20ac460 per detected case of T21, when utilised as primary screening test. However, implementing NIPT as triage test did result in the lowest expected relative costs per case of T21 diagnosed (k\u20ac141). CONCLUSION: NIPT should be implemented in national health care as an optional secondary screening test for those pregnancies complicated by a high risk for T21.",

Exon 3, 4, 6 of EDNRB gene and Exon 1, 2 of EDN-3 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). RESULTS: EDNRB mutations were detected in 2 of the 13 short-segment HD. One mutant was in the exon 3, the other was in the exon 6. EDN-3 mutation was detected in one of the 13 short-segment HD and in the exon 2. Both EDNRB and EDN-3 mutations were detected in one short-segment HD.

This study compared serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D(3) in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and non-GDM control subjects. METHODS: In this case-control study, 54 women with diagnosed GDM and 39 women with IGT (1 abnormal oral glucose tolerance test) were compared with 111 non-GDM control women in whom GDM were excluded by glucose challenge test. Controls were matched in gestational age, age, and body mass index with IGT and GDM groups. RESULTS: Maternal serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D(3) concentration in GDM and IGT groups at 24-28 weeks of gestation were significantly lower than non-GDM controls (P = .001). A total of 83.3% of GDM compared with 71.2% of the control group had plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D(3) concentrations consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL; P = .03). Women with GDM had a 2.66-fold increased risk of deficient status (25-hydroxy vitamin D(3) <15 ng/mL) compared with control group.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the dose-related efficacy and safety of pregabalin in patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHODS: This six-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study randomized patients (N=137) with moderate-to-severe idiopathic RLS in an equal ratio to placebo or pregabalin 50, 100, 150, 300, or 450 mg/day. The dose-response was characterized using an exponential decay model, which estimates the maximal effect (E(max)) for the primary endpoint, the change in the International Restless Legs Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) total score from baseline to week 6 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) responders, sleep assessments, and safety. RESULTS: The separation of treatment effect between placebo and pregabalin began to emerge starting at week 1 which continued and increased through week 6 for all dose groups. The IRLS total score for pregabalin was dose dependent and well characterized for change from baseline at week 6. The model estimated 50% (ED(50)) and 90% (ED(90)) of the maximal effect in reducing RLS symptoms that occurred at pregabalin doses of 37.3 and 123.9 mg/day, respectively. A higher proportion of CGI-I responders was observed at the two highest doses of pregabalin (300 and 450 mg/day) versus placebo. Dizziness and somnolence were the most common adverse events and appeared to be dose-related. CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week phase 2b study, pregabalin reduced RLS symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic RLS. The symptom reduction at week 6 was dose-dependent with 123.9 mg/day providing 90% efficacy. Pregabalin was safe and well tolerated across the entire dosing range.",

Patients receiving trastuzumab for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer seem to suffer from an increased risk of brain metastases, even in cases with responsive disease. To evaluate whether trastuzumab is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, we measured trastuzumab levels in the serum and in cerebrospinal fluid of metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases receiving trastuzumab for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In a pilot study, metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases and HER2-overexpressing tumors (HercepTest; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) were included. At different time points, trastuzumab levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid were measured using a newly developed immunoenzymatic test for trastuzumab. Six out of eight patients were evaluable for determination of trastuzumab level in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Before radiotherapy, median trastuzumab level in the serum was 52 054 ng/ml compared with 124 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid (ratio 420 : 1). After completion of radiotherapy, median trastuzumab level was 20 185 ng/ml in the serum and 226 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid, respectively (ratio 76 : 1). With concomitant meningeal carcinomatosis, trastuzumab level in the serum after radiotherapy was 17 431 and 356 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid (ratio 49 : 1). For the first time, we present clinical evidence that trastuzumab levels in cerebrospinal fluid are increased under conditions of an impaired blood-brain barrier such as meningeal carcinomatosis or radiotherapy. This evidence supports the concept of continuing trastuzumab therapy in patients with brain metastases treated by radiotherapy. Monitoring of trastuzumab levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid may enable individualized therapy strategies in metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases, and lead to a better understanding of trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum.",

Recycling of internalized integrins is a crucial step in adhesion remodeling and cell movement. Recently, we determined that the ADP-ribosylation factor-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1 have opposing effects on adhesion and stimulated \u03b21 integrin recycling even though they are very closely related proteins (80% sequence identity). We have now determined the sequence differences underlying the differential actions of cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1. We found that the ability of cytohesins to promote \u03b21 integrin recycling and adhesion depends upon the presence or absence of a key glycine residue in their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. This glycine residue determines the phosphoinositide specificity and affinity of cytohesin PH domains. Switching the number of glycines in the PH domains of cytohesin 2 and cytohesin 3 is sufficient to reverse their effects on adhesion and spreading and to reverse their subcellular locations. Importantly, we also find that a mutant form of cytohesin 3/GRP1 that has three rather than two glycines in its PH domain rescues \u03b21 integrin recycling in cytohesin 2/ARNO knockdown cells. Conversely, a mutant form of cytohesin 2/ARNO with two glycines in its PH domain fails to rescue \u03b21 integrin recycling. Therefore, we conclude that phosphoinositide specificity is the sole functional difference that determines which cytohesin can promote integrin recycling.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment options for symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). DATA SOURCES: Literature was obtained through searches of MEDLINE Ovid (1950-March week 3, 2008) and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology (all years), as well as a bibliographic review of articles identified by the searches. Key terms included premenstrual syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, PMS, PMDD, and treatment. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: All pertinent clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case reports in human subjects published in the English language were identified and evaluated for the safety and efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments of PMS/PMDD. Data from these studies and information from review articles were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. Suppression of ovulation using hormonal therapies is an alternative approach to treating PMDD when SSRIs or second-line psychotropic agents are ineffective; however, adverse effects limit their use. Anxiolytics, spironolactone, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be used as supportive care to relieve symptoms. Despite lack of specific evidence, lifestyle modifications and exercise are first-line recommendations for all women with PMS/PMDD and may be all that is needed to treat mild-to-moderate symptoms. Herbal and vitamin supplementation and complementary and alternative medicine have been evaluated for use in PMS/PMDD and have produced unclear or conflicting results. More controlled clinical trials are needed to determine their safety and efficacy and potential for drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers need to be aware of the symptoms of PMS and PMDD and the treatment options available.

METHODS AND RESULTS: MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method using a modified Middlebrook 7H9 broth. RS-118641 was the most potent compound overall. The MIC50/90 (mg/L) results for RS-118641 were: M. tuberculosis, 1/2; multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis, 0.5/2; M. avium, 4/8; and M. intracellulare, 0.06/0.5. No statistically significant differences in MIC distributions were observed between non-MDR and MDR M. tuberculosis for any of the capuramycin analogues tested. In order to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RS-112997 and RS-124922 in a murine lung model of tuberculosis, both compounds were administered intranasally at 0.1 or 1 mg/mouse/day for 12 days.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke. We conducted analyses on additional end points and sensitivity analyses to confirm our findings. METHODS: We randomized 1722 patients with acute ischemic stroke to a 72-hour infusion of placebo or intravenous NXY-059 within 6 hours of stroke onset. The primary outcome was disability at 90 days, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (no residual symptoms) to 5 (bed-bound, requiring constant care). Additional and exploratory analyses included mRS at 7 and 30 days; subgroup interactions with final mRS; assessments of activities of daily living by Barthel index; and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) neurological scores at 7 and 90 days. RESULTS: NXY-059 significantly improved the distribution of the mRS disability score compared with placebo at 7, 30, and 90 days (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test P=0.002, 0.004, 0.038, respectively; 90-day common odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.42). The benefit was not attributable to any specific baseline characteristic, stratification variable or subgroup interaction.

CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability. Benefit on neurological scores and activities of daily living was detectable early but not significant at 90 days; however, our trial was underpowered to measure effects on the neurological examination.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is regarded as a suitable target for antiangiogenic strategies. However, antiangiogenic agents aimed at single targets can be neutralized by upregulation of other proangiogenic factors. Therefore, combined approaches addressing at least two angiogenic targets should be more effective. Employing an appropriate rat hepatoma model, we examined the effects of sFlt-1 (soluble vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor 1 as an indirect inhibitor of angiogenesis) and endostatin (a direct inhibitor of angiogenesis) in both single-agent as well as combined approaches under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Similar to human HCC, rat Morris hepatoma (MH) cells secreted high levels of VEGF, but no endogenous sFlt-1. Parental MH or MHES(r) cells, stably expressing rat endostatin, were adenovirally transduced either with AdsFlt-1 (encoding sFlt-1) or control vector Adnull (containing no transgene), followed by subcutaneous inoculation into syngeneic ACI rats. Compared with MH/Adnull cells, expressing no antiangiogenic factors at all, tumor weights were reduced fourfold in the MHES(r)/Adnull group, 19-fold in the MH/AdsFlt-1-group, and 77-fold in the MHES(r)/AdsFlt-1 combination therapy group. Analysis of variance did not show a significant interaction between the effects of the two factors ES(r) and sFlt-1; their effects multiplied. In conclusion, combined expression of sFlt-1 and endostatin effectively suppresses HCC growth under in vivo conditions.

BCL-2, AKT and pAKT were detected by western blotting for analysis of potential mechanisms. miR-21 was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues while PTEN was expressed in lower levels compared to non-tumor tissues. A negative correlation between expression of miR-21 and PTEN was established in vivo. Cell proliferation and chemoresistance to doxorubicin were promoted by overexpression of miR-21 in T24 cells. BCL-2 up-regulation could be achieved by miR-21 overexpression, which prevented T24 cells from apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. Furthermore, the miR-21 induced BCL-2 up-regulation could be cancelled by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These data verified the oncogenic role of miR-21 in TCCs and may usher in new therapeutic strategies in treating this disease.",

Not only are mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 associated with ALS and FTLD, but this protein is also a major constituent of pathological intracellular inclusions in these diseases. Recent studies have significantly expanded our understanding of TDP-43 physiology. TDP-43 is now known to play important roles in neuronal RNA metabolism. It binds to and regulates the splicing and stability of numerous RNAs encoding proteins involved in neuronal development, synaptic function and neurodegeneration. Thus, a loss of these essential functions is an attractive hypothesis regarding the role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. Moreover, TDP-43 is an aggregation-prone protein and, given the role of toxic protein aggregates in neurodegeneration, a toxic gain-of-function mechanism is another rational hypothesis. Importantly, ALS related mutations modulate the propensity of TDP-43 to aggregate in cell culture. Several recent studies have documented that cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates co-localize with stress granule markers. Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Thus, understanding the interplay between TDP-43 aggregation, stress granules and the effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations may be the key to understanding the role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. We propose two models of TDP-43 aggregate formation. The \"independent model\" stipulates that TDP-43 aggregation is independent of stress granule formation, in contrast to the \"precursor model\" which presents the idea that stress granule formation contributes to a TDP-43 aggregate \"seed\" and that chronic stress leads to concentration-dependent TDP-43 aggregation.

Patients (18-65\u00a0yr, N\u00a0=\u00a0602) were randomized (1:1:1) to vortioxetine 10 or 20\u00a0mg/d or placebo for 8 wk in a double-blind multi-national study.

The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 8 in a composite z-score comprising the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) scores. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

High levels of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased genetic instability, which has been linked to DNA damage. Here, we describe a pGAL-CAN1 forward mutation assay for studying transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) in yeast. In a wild-type background with no alterations in DNA repair capacity, = 50% of forward mutations that arise in the CAN1 gene under high-transcription conditions are deletions of 2-5 bp. Furthermore, the deletions characteristic of TAM localize to discrete hotspots that coincide with 2-4 copies of a tandem repeat. Although the signature deletions of TAM are not affected by the loss of error-free or error-prone lesion bypass pathways, they are completely eliminated by deletion of the TOP1 gene, which encodes the yeast type IB topoisomerase. Hotspots can be transposed into the context of a frameshift reversion assay, which is sensitive enough to detect Top1-dependent deletions even in the absence of high transcription. We suggest that the accumulation of Top1 cleavage complexes is related to the level of transcription and that their removal leads to the signature deletions. Given the high degree of conservation between DNA metabolic processes, the links established here among transcription, Top1, and mutagenesis are likely to extend beyond the yeast system.",

          "context": "[Psychiatric and psychological aspects of premenstrual syndrome]. Numerous, but heterogeneous studies have been performed about premenstrual syndrome, with finally a lack of credibility and interest among practitioners. More recently with the diagnosis criteria generalization, psychiatrists were more concerned about this syndrome, because of anxiety and mood symptoms involved in social impairment and need of medical care. In 1983 in the United States, the National Institute of Mental Health conference devoted to this topic proposed the first diagnosis criteria, requiring a prospective and daily assessment of the symptoms. In 1987, the American Psychiatric Association, in the DSM III-R, introduced the Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder diagnosis that became in 1994 in the DSM IV the Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, with the same diagnosis criteria. In the literature, prevalence rates are very heterogeneous according to the diagnosis criteria used and to the populations studied. One of the most relevant criteria is the induced impairment, such as avoidance of social activities, or search for medical care. Lifetime prevalence is thus estimated between 75 and 85% if considering the report of one or several symptoms, between 10 and 15% in case of medical care request, and between 2 and 5% in case of social activities interruption. To distinguish isolated complaints from a disabling disorder, self-questionnaires are the best way of assessment in a so complex and changing disease. Most of the epidemiological studies found a positive correlation between the premenstrual dysphoric symptoms and the lifetime major depressive disorder diagnosis. However, recent prospective studies failed to find an association between premenstrual syndrome and an increased risk of major depression. On the other hand, some studies showed that the premenstrual period is a risk period for associated psychiatric disorders exacerbations, as the obsessive-compulsive disorder, more severe alcohol intakes in case of alcoholism, symptoms increase in schizophrenics, or higher rates of suicide attempts. The most widely studied and frequently blamed etiopathogenic hypothesis is the serotonin dysregulation. Serotonin is particularly involved in expression of irritability and anger, but also in occurrence of depressive symptoms and specific food cravings, precisely found in the premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Among their different effects, estrogens increase the density of serotonin receptors and enhance the sensitivity to serotonin agonists. Moreover, some studies found a significantly different response to d-fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist, in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In psychoanalytical theories the premenstrual syndrome was associated to a \"femininity complex\", to an ambivalent pregnancy desire, and to unconscious conflicts relating to sexual preference. In this context, Karen Horney, who took a great interest in the premenstrual period, was radically opposed to the Freudian theory of feminine sexuality, in particular the negation of the female sex. For Karen Homey, the \"desire of penis\" is more expressive of the woman's spite not to share the sexual, but also political, social and cultural benefits fallen to men. To understand the premenstrual period feelings it is also necessary to take into account the personal history of the woman and the psychosocial factors involved, as the social and cultural beliefs, and the mother-daughter communication. Medical cares are necessary when symptoms constitute a severe and disabling disorder. Among non-psychiatric treatments, progesterone was the most widely prescribed treatment, but relating to recent performed studies, it failed to prove its efficiency in such an indication. In the same way, the efficiency of the contraceptive pill was not demonstrated. The most prescribed psychiatric treatments are serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines. First studies showing serotonin re-uptake inhibitors efficiency in premenstrual dysphoric disorder were performed in the beginning of the nineties, with clomipramine and fluoxetine, and later fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo. Low doses of clomipramine (10 to 50 mg per day) seem to be sufficient and it appears also preferable to prescribe an intermittent treatment because of a possible tolerance effect, susceptible to be warned by phases free of treatment. Alprazolam was the most studied benzodiazepine in this indication. Most studies were positive, using daily posologies of 0.25 to 4 mg during the 6 days preceding the menses, with improvement of irritability, anxiety and depressive mood. The general practitioner frequently carries out psychological support, in particular in case of mild symptoms without consequences. Nevertheless, underestimate a more severe psychological suffering is a risk, firstly because there is no systematic interrelationship between the somatic symptoms intensity and the psychological distress, and secondly because premenstrual period is a special emotionally moment to put in evidence psychological or relational disruption. All kinds of psychotherapy can be relevant, even though the training of relaxation techniques is particularly suitable in such an indication. In conclusion, and in spite of the generalization of the diagnosis criteria in the international psychiatric classifications as the DSM, the premenstrual syndrome remains a complex and polymorphous disorder. The premenstrual syndrome was considered for a long time like a somatic disease, but now the psychiatric symptoms severity justifies most often the medical cares. In order to distinguish some isolated and mild complaints, of a disabling disorder, the standardized prospective auto-assessment is the most relevant method. Finally, intermittent prescription of serotonin re-uptake inhibitors appears to be the most effective treatment, the previously used hormonal treatments not having made proof of their efficiency in such an indication.",

INTRODUCTION: Intestinal endometriosis is often an infrequently considered diagnosis in female of childbearing age by general surgeon. There is a delay in diagnosis because of constellation of symptoms and lack of specific diagnostic modalities. Patients suffer from intestinal endometriosis for many years before they are diagnosed. Often, such patients are labelled with irritable bowel syndrome. Intestinal endometriosis has a diagnostic time delay of 8-11 years due to its non-specific clinical features and multi-system involvement. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Our patient was a 32 years old Caucasian female who was referred to us with features of intestinal obstruction. Despite repeated clinical assessments and use of different diagnostic modalities the diagnosis was still inconclusive even after 21 days of her first presentation to primary care physician. She had an exploratory laparotomy, sigmoid colectomy, and Hartmann's procedure with a temporary colostomy with us. Histopathology confirmed endometriosis and also showed melanosis coli. She was referred to the gynaecological team for review and follow up. DISCUSSION: Intestinal endometriosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in female patients of childbearing age group presenting with non-specific gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. Our patient manifested intestinal endometriosis and melanosis coli on histopathology suggesting symptoms of long duration.

Purpose: DNA damage defects are common in ovarian cancer and can be used to stratify treatment. Although most work has focused on homologous recombination (HR), DNA double-strand breaks are repaired primarily by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Defects in NHEJ have been shown to contribute to genomic instability and have been associated with the development of chemoresistance.Experimental Design: NHEJ was assessed in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and 47 primary ascetic-derived ovarian cancer cultures, by measuring the ability of cell extracts to end-join linearized plasmid monomers into multimers. mRNA and protein expression of components of NHEJ was determined using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Cytotoxicities of cisplatin and the PARP inhibitor rucaparib were assessed using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. HR function was assessed using \u03b3H2AX/RAD51 foci assay.Results: NHEJ was defective (D) in four of six cell lines and 20 of 47 primary cultures. NHEJ function was independent of HR competence (C). NHEJD cultures were resistant to rucaparib (P = 0.0022). When HR and NHEJ functions were taken into account, only NHEJC/HRD cultures were sensitive to rucaparib (compared with NHEJC/HRC P = 0.034, NHEJD/HRC P = 0.0002, and NHEJD/HRD P = 0.0045). The DNA-PK inhibitor, NU7441, induced resistance to rucaparib (P = 0.014) and HR function recovery in a BRCA1-defective cell line.Conclusions: This study has shown that NHEJ is defective in 40% of ovarian cancers, which is independent of HR function and associated with resistance to PARP inhibitors in ex vivo primary cultures.

Major histocompatibility class II (MHC class II) molecules are glycoproteins that present extracellular antigens to CD4(+) T cells and are essential for initiation of adaptive immune responses. MHC class II expression requires recruitment of a master regulator, the class II transactivator (CIITA), to the MHC class II promoter. Others and we have earlier linked CIITA to the ubiquitin-proteasome system by showing that mono-ubiquitination of CIITA increases its transactivity, whereas poly-ubiquitination of CIITA leads to its degradation. We have further shown that the 26S proteasome also has non-proteolytic functions in MHC class II transcription, as 19S ATPase subunits of the 26S proteasome positively regulate MHC class II transcription and are necessary for stable promoter binding of CIITA. Although these basic requirements of the proteasome to initiate MHC class II transcription are known, how CIITA is recruited, stabilized, and degraded remains unclear. Here, we identify a novel N-terminal 19S ATPase-binding domain of CIITA. The ATPase-binding domain lies within the proline/serine/threonine-rich region of CIITA and encompasses a majority of the CIITA degron sequence. Absence of the ATPase-binding domain increases the half-life of CIITA, but blocks MHC class II surface expression, indicating that CIITA requires interaction with the 19S ATPases for both appropriate deployment and destruction.",

Each patient's depressive status, according to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and functional outcome, based on the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), were evaluated before the tumor was surgically treated as well as 3 months and 1 year after surgery. Before surgery 27 patients (35%) had BDI scores indicating the presence of depression. These scores were significantly higher in patients with a history of depression (p = 0.017) and in those with a lower functional outcome (p = 0.015). In the entire study sample the severity of depression decreased statistically significantly (p = 0.031) at 3 months postsurgery.

BACKGROUND: Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150\u00a0mg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile. METHODS: The INPULSIS\u2122 trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150\u00a0mg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF. Eligible patients were aged > 40 years with a diagnosis of IPF within 5 years before randomization who had undergone a chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan within 1-year before screening, and who had a forced vital capacity (FVC) of > 50% predicted and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 30-79% predicted. Participants were randomized 3:2 to receive nintedanib or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint is the annual rate of decline in FVC. The key secondary endpoints are change from baseline in the total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (a measure of health-related quality of life) over 52 weeks and time to first acute exacerbation. RESULTS: Enrolment of 1066 patients in 24 countries was completed in September 2012. Results will be reported in the first half of 2014. CONCLUSION: The INPULSIS\u2122 trials will determine the efficacy of nintedanib in patients with IPF, including its impact on disease progression as defined by decline in FVC, acute exacerbations and health-related quality of life. In addition, they will characterise the adverse event profile of nintedanib in this patient population.

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder affecting ectodermal tissue: skin, eyes, central nervous system, hair, nails, and teeth. It is usually lethal for males in utero. The involved gene is NEMO, an essential component of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. Skin lesions are highly diagnostic, occurring in neonates, with a particular distribution on Blaschko lines. The severity of the disease is related to ocular and neurological impairment. The hallmark of ocular IP is retinal vasculopathy including peripheral retinal vascular nonperfusion, macular infarction and neovascularization, and preretinal neovascularization. CNS involvement consists of seizures, mental retardation, hemiparesis, spasticity, microcephaly, cerebellar ataxia, and coma. It often occurs in neonates. Some patients have persistent pharmacoresistant seizures throughout life. MRI findings consist essentially in: white-matter lesions; scattered cortical neuronal necrosis; multiple cerebral infarctions; cerebral atrophy, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, encephalomalacia and neuronal heterotopia. A predominant role of vascular occlusive phenomena in small vessels is highly suspected. In fact several intricate mechanisms could be discussed: vascular, inflammatory, developmental mechanisms. Their role and predictive factors of IP CNS involvement in neonatal IP need to be better understood to identify effective innovative therapies. Hypomelanosis of Ito can occur in the neonate, infancy, or childhood, be isolated or diffuse, often following the Blaschko lines, and can fade in childhood or adulthood. It is due to reduced melanin in the epidermis. Eye, central nervous (mental retardation, epilepsy, language disabilities, motor system dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms including autism - with frequent cortical malformations including hemimegalencephaly and white matter involvement), and musculoskeletal systems can also be affected. Mosaicism with various chromosomal rearrangements has been reported.",

Whether considering gene regulation, the components of metabolic pathways or signaling cascades, the ability to reuse autonomous modules in different molecular contexts can expedite evolutionary innovation. Similarly, protein domains are the modules of proteins, and modular domain rearrangements can create diversity with seemingly few operations in turn allowing for swift changes to an organism's functional repertoire. Here, we assess the patterns and functional effects of modular rearrangements at high resolution. Using a well resolved and diverse group of pancrustaceans, we illustrate arrangement diversity within closely related organisms, estimate arrangement turnover frequency and establish, for the first time, branch-specific rate estimates for fusion, fission, domain addition and terminal loss. Our results show that roughly 16 new arrangements arise per million years and that between 64% and 81% of these can be explained by simple, single-step modular rearrangement events. We find evidence that the frequencies of fission and terminal deletion events increase over time, and that modular rearrangements impact all levels of the cellular signaling apparatus and thus may have strong adaptive potential. Novel arrangements that cannot be explained by simple modular rearrangements contain a significant amount of repeat domains that occur in complex patterns which we term \"supra-repeats\". Furthermore, these arrangements are significantly longer than those with a single-step rearrangement solution, suggesting that such arrangements may result from multi-step events. In summary, our analysis provides an integrated view and initial quantification of the patterns and functional impact of modular protein evolution in a well resolved phylogenetic tree.

After SAH, primary and secondary complications are frequent and often require neurosurgical interventions to avoid secondary brain damage.

Evidence from prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies support grade A recommendations (standard) for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm with oral Nimodipine in good grade patients. For intravenous Nimodipine or for oral nimodipine treatment in poor grade patients, available data only support grade C recommendations (options). Despite the lack of data supporting standards (grade A) or guidelines (grade B), avoidance and rigorous treatment of hypotension and hypovolemia remains the mainstay in the prophylaxis and treatment of a delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND). Prophylactic hypervolemia or prophylactic hypertension and hypervolemia was shown to be ineffective in reducing symptomatic vasospasm and improving outcome (grade B). Therapeutic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution is recommended as a treatment of symptomatic vasospasm but no prospective studies are available (grade C recommendation). Suggested target values for moderate triple-H-therapy are CPP 80- 120 mmHg (MAP 90-130), CVP > 7 mmHg and Hk 0.25-0.40. Balloon angioplasty should be considered for treatment of DIND cause by focal, proximal cerebral vasospasm. There is no evidence supporting the routine use of antifibrinolyticals, steroids or anticonvulsive prophylaxis. Clinical data indicate that current prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm is still insufficient and aggressive triple-H-therapy is associated with an increased incidence of complications.",

BACKGROUND: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are highly constrained elements of mammalian genomes, whose functional role has not been completely elucidated yet. Previous studies have shown that some of them act as enhancers in mouse, while some others are expressed in both normal and cancer-derived human tissues. Only one UCE element so far was shown to present these two functions concomitantly, as had been observed in other isolated instances of single, non ultraconserved enhancer elements. RESULTS: We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand. Although the nature of these transcripts remains a mistery, our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq datasets indicates that they are unlikely to be short RNAs and that some of them might encode nuclear transcripts. In the majority of cases this function overlaps with the already established enhancer function of these elements during mouse development. Utilizing several next-generation sequencing datasets, we were further able to show that the level of expression observed in non-exonic UCEs is significantly higher than in random regions of the genome and that this is also seen in other regions which act as enhancers. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that the concurrent presence of enhancer and transcript function in non-exonic UCE elements is more widespread than previously shown. Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand.",

BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is usually characterised by a progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy often with associated cardiac failure and is due to dominantly inherited transthyretin mutations causing accelerated amyloid deposition. The UK population is unique in that the majority of patients have the T60A missense mutation in ATTR where tyrosine is replaced by adenine at position 60. This has been traced to a single founder mutation from north-west Ireland. The neuropathy phenotype is less well described than the cardiac manifestations in this group. METHODS: We present the findings from an observational cohort study of patients with ATTR attending the National Hospital Inherited Neuropathy Clinic between 2009 and 2013. Detailed clinical neurological and electrophysiological data were collected on all patients alongside correlating autonomic and cardiac assessments. Follow-up data were available on a subset. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with genetically confirmed ATTR were assessed; 37 were symptomatic; mean age at onset=62 years, range=38-75 years; 75.7% male. T60A was the most common mutation (17/37), followed by V30M (5/37). A severe, rapidly progressive, predominantly length dependent axonal sensorimotor neuropathy was the predominant phenotype. T60A patients were distinguished by earlier and more frequent association with carpal tunnel syndrome; a predominance of negative sensory symptoms at onset; significant vibration deficits; and a non-length dependent progression of motor deficit. Progression of the neuropathy was observed over a relatively short follow-up period (2 years) in 20 patients with evidence of clinically measurable annual change in Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (-1.5 points per year) and Charcot Marie Tooth Neuropathy Score (CMTNS:2.7 points per year), and a congruent trend in the electrophysiological measures used. CONCLUSION: The description of the ATTR neuropathy phenotype, especially in the T60A patients, should aid early diagnosis as well as contribute to the understanding of its natural history.",

Although most pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are sporadic, molecular genetic medicine has revealed that a considerable number of patients with apparently sporadic PCC actually have a genetic predisposition to the development of these tumors. After decades of intensive research, several genes are now known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PCC. At present, these are RET proto-oncogene, von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene (VHL), neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor suppressor gene (NF1), genes encoding the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex subunits SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, but also SDHA, the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the flavination of SDHA (SDHAF2 or hSDH5), and the newly described TMEM127 and MAX tumor suppressor genes. In addition to these ten PCC susceptibility genes, two other genes, KIF1B and PHD2, have also been associated with PCC. Studying the pathogenesis and the molecular correlation of these mutations has revealed the existence of two main transcription signatures: a pseudohypoxic cluster (VHL and SDH mutations) and a cluster rich in kinase receptor signaling and their downstream pathways (RET, NF1, TMEM127, and MAX mutations). However, the general mechanism in the pathogenesis of a syndrome does not entirely apply in the particular pathogenesis of PCC as a manifestation of that syndrome. A better understanding of the complexity and high genetic diversity of PCC and PGL may lead to more efficient diagnosis and management of the disease.",

This effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Casper interacted with p105 in 293 cells and this interaction was mediated through the C-terminal IkappaB-like domain (IkappaBgamma). Overexpression of p105 and IkappaBgamma inhibited Casper-induced NF-kappaB activation and potentiated Casper-induced apoptosis.

Hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful, recurrent nodules and abscesses that rupture and lead to sinus tracts and scarring. To date, an evidence-based therapeutic approach has not been the standard of care and this is likely due to the lack of evidence based treatment guidelines. The purpose of this study was to promote a holistic evidence-based approach which implemented Level of Evidence and Strength of Recommendation for the treatment of HS. Based upon the European Dermatology Forumguidelines for the management of HS, evidence-based approach was explored for the treatment of HS. The diagnosis of HS should be made by a dermatologist or other healthcare professional with expert knowledge in HS. All patients should be offered adjuvant therapy as needed (pain management, weight loss, tobacco cessation, treatment of super infections, and application of appropriate dressings). The treating physician should be familiar with disease severity scores, especially Hurley staging, physician global assessment and others. The routine use of patient'reported outcomesincluding DLQI, itch and pain assessment (Visual Analogue Scale) is strongly recommended. The need for surgical intervention should be assessed in all patients depending upon type and extent of scarring, and an evidence-based surgical approach should be implemented. Evidence-based medical treatment of mild disease consists of topical Clindamycin 1\u00a0% solution/gel b.i.d. for 12\u00a0weeks or Tetracycline 500 p.o. b.i.d. for 4\u00a0months (LOE IIb, SOR B), for more widespread disease. If patient fails to exhibit response to treatment or for a PGA of moderate-to-severe disease, Clindamycin 300 p.o. b.i.d. with Rifampicin 600 p.o. o.d. for 10\u00a0weeks (LOE III, SOR C) should be considered. If patient is not improved, then Adalimumab 160\u00a0mg at week 0, 80\u00a0mg at week 2; then 40\u00a0mg subcutaneously weekly should be administered (LOE Ib, SOR A). If improvement occurs then therapy should be maintained as long as HS lesions are present. If the patient fails to exhibit response, then consideration of second or third line therapy is required. A growing body of evidence is being published to guide the treatment of HS. HS therapy should be based upon the evaluation of the inflammatory components as well as the scarring and should be directed by evidence-based guidelines. Treatment should include surgery as well as medical treatment.

Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.",

The Ser96Ala (S96A) mutation within the histidine rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release events. However, the molecular mechanism connecting the S96A mutation of HRC to increased Ca(2+) release events remains unclear. Previous findings by our group indicate that these spontaneous Ca(2+) release events may be linked to store overload induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) via the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Therefore, in the present study we sought to determine whether HRC wild type (HRC WT) and S96A mutant (HRC S96A) expression has a direct effect on SOICR. Using both cytosolic and intra-Ca(2+) store measurements in human embryonic kidney cells expressing RyR2, we found that HRC WT significantly inhibited the propensity for SOICR by buffering store free Ca(2+) and inhibiting store Ca(2+) uptake. In contrast, HRC S96A exhibited a markedly suppressed inhibitory effect on SOICR, which was attributed to an impaired ability to buffer store Ca(2+) and reduce store Ca(2+) uptake. In addition to impairing the ability of HRC to regulate bulk store Ca(2+), a proximity ligation assay demonstrated that the S96A mutation also disrupts the Ca(2+) microdomain around the RyR2, as it alters the Ca(2+) dependent association of RyR2 and HRC. Importantly, in contrast to previous reports, the absence of triadin in our experimental model illustrates that the S96A mutation in HRC can alter the propensity for SOICR without any interaction with triadin. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the human HRC mutation S96A leads to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free Ca(2+). This is primarily due to an impaired ability to act as an effective bulk and local microdomain store Ca(2+) buffer.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of human Ala96 HRC or Ser96 HRC in the null background to assess function in absence of endogenous protein. Ala96 HRC decreased (25% to 30%) cardiomyocyte contractility and Ca2+ kinetics compared with Ser96 HRC in the absence of any structural or histological abnormalities. Furthermore, the frequency of Ca2+ waves was significantly higher (10-fold), although SR Ca2+ load was reduced (by 27%) in Ala96 HRC cells. The underlying mechanisms involved diminished interaction of Ala96 HRC with triadin, affecting ryanodine receptor (RyR) stability. Indeed, the open probability of RyR, assessed by use of ryanodine binding, was significantly increased. Accordingly, stress conditions (5 Hz plus isoproterenol) induced aftercontractions (65% in Ala96 versus 12% in Ser96) and delayed afterdepolarizations (70% in Ala96 versus 20% in Ser96). The increased SR Ca2+ leak was accompanied by hyperphosphorylation (1.6-fold) of RyR at Ser2814 by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Accordingly, inclusion of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93 prevented Ser2814 phosphorylation and partially reversed the increases in Ca2+ spark frequency and wave production. Parallel in vivo studies revealed ventricular ectopy on short-term isoproterenol challenge and increased (4-fold) propensity to arrhythmias, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, after myocardial infarction in Ala96 HRC mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers.",

Directional cell migration requires the formation of a dominant pseudopodium in the direction toward which the cell migrates. When a migratory cell is stimulated with a chemoattractant or extracellular matrix (ECM) gradient, it responds with localized amplification of signals on the side facing the gradient. The signals mediate reorganization of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, leading to morphological polarization of the cell and pseudopodium extension. To identify these signals, we developed an approach to biochemically isolate the pseudopodium from the cell body using 3.0-micrometer porous filters for large-scale quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis. Here, we detail the methodology for pseudopodium purification and proteomic analysis. This model system should be widely applicable for the analysis of the pseudopodium proteome from various migratory cell lines, including primary and cancer cell lines stimulated with a diverse array of chemoattractants, ECM proteins, or both.",

PURPOSE: To determine the relative contributions of patient, disease and therapy specific factors on neurocognitive outcome of brain tumor patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients (mean age = 41.1 years; range: 17-75 years; 54% male, 46% female) with glioblastoma multiforme (37%), anaplastic astrocytoma (17%), low grade astrocytoma (13%), and oligodendroglioma (10%) predominantly in the frontal regions (45%) were evaluated in an outpatient neuro-oncology clinic. A neuropsychological test battery emphasized elements of attention/concentration. Multiple regression analyses determined relationships between functional outcomes and demographic and clinical predictors. RESULTS: Key predictors of neurocognitive functioning included age of the patient (36-59 years, p < 0.01; >/= 60 years, p < 0.05) and frontal region tumor location (p < 0.01). As expected, older patients did not perform as well as younger patients in absolute terms on neuropsychological tests; decrements persisted when comparisons were based on age-standardized versions of neurocognitive outcomes. Major depressive disorder was marginally associated with outcomes, while surgical interventions and radiotherapy did not show strong associations with test performances. CONCLUSIONS: Primary malignant brain disease was found to be less negative on neurocognitive outcomes for younger than for either middle-aged or older patients. Treatments were not as predictive of neurocognitive outcomes as age. No single test outcome measure was as sensitive to neurocognitive status as the empirically derived index of attention and concentration.",

By use of rabbit duodenal tissue, a calcein fluorescence assay has previously been developed to assess transport of divalent metal ions across the small-intestinal brush border membrane (BBM). The assay was readily applied here to rat BBM to learn if it detects DMT1 activity. The results demonstrate protein-mediated transport across the BBM of all tested ions: Mn(2+), Fe(2+), and Ni(2+). Transport into BBM vesicles (BBMV) from (b/b) Belgrade rats was below the detection limit. BBMV of +/b origin had substantial activity. The kinetic rate constant for Ni(2+) membrane transport for +/b BBMV was within the range for normal rabbit tissue. Vesicles from +/b basolateral membranes (BLM) showed similar activity to BBMV while b/b BLM vesicles (BLMV) lacked transport activity. Immunoblots using isoform-specific antibodies demonstrated that intestinal levels of b/b DMT1 were increased compared to +/b DMT1, reflecting iron deficiency. Immunoblots on BBMV indicated that lack of activity in b/b vesicles was not due to a failure of DMT1 to localize to the BBMV; an excess of specific isoforms was present compared to +/b BBMV or duodenal extracts. Immunoblots from BLMV also exhibited enrichment in DMT1 isoforms, despite their distinct origin. Immunofluorescent staining of thin sections of b/b and +/b proximal intestines confirmed that DMT1 localized similarly in mutant and control enterocytes and showed that DMT1 isoforms have distinct distributions within intestinal tissue.",

Electron microscopic analysis of RNA:DNA hybrids, complete nucleotide sequence, and identification of 5' homologous sequences among apolipoprotein genes. Cloned human apo-C-II cDNA was used as a hybridization probe to identify the human apo-C-II gene in a genomic library constructed in our laboratory. The isolated apo-C-II DNA was studied both by electron microscopy and by direct sequence analysis. Ultrastructural morphological analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids revealed that the apo-C-II gene had complex structures because of regions of inverted complementary sequences in and around the gene forming stem-and-loop structures which interfere with the formation of stable RNA:DNA hybrids. Extensive morphological analysis revealed a minimum of 3 intervening sequences (IVS), and their lengths were measured. Direct sequence analysis of the cloned gene confirmed the presence of 3 IVS. There are 4 Alu type sequences in IVS-I. We sequenced 4340 nucleotides which include 545 nucleotides in the 5' flanking region, the entire gene which spans 3320 nucleotides, and 475 nucleotides in the 3' flanking region which also encompasses an additional Alu sequence.

A subgroup was analyzed regarding efficacy and side effects of iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose. RESULTS: In the cohort (n = 250), 54.4% of the patients had serum iron levels < 60 \u03bcg/dl, 81.2% had ferritin < 100 ng/ml, and 25.6% had hemoglobin (Hb) of < 12 g/dl (females) or < 13 g/dl (males).

BACKGROUND: Urinary biomarkers for bladder cancer detection are constrained by inadequate sensitivity or specificity. Here we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Mcm5, a novel cell cycle biomarker of aberrant growth, alone and in combination with NMP22. METHODS: 1677 consecutive patients under investigation for urinary tract malignancy were recruited to a prospective blinded observational study. All patients underwent ultrasound, intravenous urography, cystoscopy, urine culture and cytologic analysis. An immunofluorometric assay was used to measure Mcm5 levels in urine cell sediments. NMP22 urinary levels were determined with the FDA-approved NMP22\u00ae Test Kit. RESULTS: Genito-urinary tract cancers were identified in 210/1564 (13%) patients with an Mcm5 result and in 195/1396 (14%) patients with an NMP22 result. At the assay cut-point where sensitivity and specificity were equal, the Mcm5 test detected primary and recurrent bladder cancers with 69% sensitivity (95% confidence interval = 62-75%) and 93% negative predictive value (95% CI = 92-95%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Mcm5 was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.71-0.79) and 0.72 (95% CI = 0.67-0.77) for NMP22. Importantly, Mcm5 combined with NMP22 identified 95% (79/83; 95% CI = 88-99%) of potentially life threatening diagnoses (i.e. grade 3 or carcinoma in situ or stage > pT1) with high specificity (72%, 95% CI = 69-74%). CONCLUSIONS: The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit. The combination of Mcm5 plus NMP22 improves the detection of UCC and identifies 95% of clinically significant disease.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent associations of vigorous (> or = 6 resting metabolic rate [MET] score) and nonvigorous (< 6 MET score) physical activity with longevity. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study, following up men from 1962 or 1966 through 1988. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were Harvard University alumni, without self-reported, physician-diagnosed cardiovascular disease, cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 17,321). Men with a mean age of 46 years reported their physical activities on questionnaires at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality (3728 deaths). RESULTS: Total energy expenditure and energy expenditure from vigorous activities, but not energy expenditure from nonvigorous activities, related inversely to mortality. After adjustment for potential confounders, the relative risks of dying associated with increasing quintiles of total energy expenditure were 1.00 (referent), 0.94, 0.95, 0.91 and 0.91, respectively (P [trend] < .05). The relative risks of dying associated with less than 630, 630 to less than 1680, 1680 to less than 3150, 3150 to less than 6300, and 6300 or more kJ/wk expended on vigorous activities were 1.00 (referent), 0.88, 0.92, 0.87, and 0.87, respectively (P [trend] = .007). Corresponding relative risks for energy expended on nonvigorous activities were 1.00 (referent), 0.89, 1.00, 0.98, and 0.92, respectively (P [trend] = .36). Analyses of vigorous and nonvigorous activities were mutually adjusted. Among men who reported only vigorous activities (259 deaths), we observed decreasing age-standardized mortality rates with increasing activity (P = .05); among men who reported only nonvigorous activities (380 deaths), no trend was apparent (P = .99). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a graded inverse relationship between total physical activity and mortality. Furthermore, vigorous activities but not nonvigorous activities were associated with longevity.

It is dominantly transmitted, when associated with the APC gene, and recessively inherited, when associated with MUTYH gene. We searched for APC and MUTYH germline alterations in Italian and Greek patients with attenuated polyposis, a phenotypic variant whose genetic cause remains unknown in many cases. METHODS: We studied 26 unrelated patients (and 16 relatives) with multiple colorectal adenomas (3-100, by endoscopic analysis) that had screened APC mutation-negative by protein truncation test. We searched for APC rearrangements by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and for MUTYH mutations by sequencing. We performed a screening of five MUTYH recurrent pathogenic mutations in 501 Italian and 144 Greek controls. RESULTS: One patient proved to carry an APC whole-gene deletion; 4 of 25 (16%) patients showed biallelic and 3 of 25 (12%) monoallelic MUTYH mutations. In the three heterozygous subjects no pathogenetic variants were found in OGG1, MTH1, APE1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes. Frequency assessment of MUTYH mutations in healthy subjects showed that only Y165C and G382D reach a subpolymorphic frequency. CONCLUSION: Attenuated polyposis patients without \"conventional\" APC mutations are genetically heterogeneous, and the phenotype is not directly related to the germline defect. Therefore, the families' appropriate management requires an accurate genetic and clinical investigation.",

OBJECTIVES: The contribution of overexpressed microRNA-21 and -221 (miR-21 and miR-221) to the malignant phenotype was determined by inhibiting these miRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides. METHODS: The effects of antisense to miR-21 and miR-221 on cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, combinatorial effects with gemcitabine, and effects on target protein levels were studied. RESULTS: Low nanomolar concentrations of both antisense oligonucleotides reduced proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Reduced proliferation was less pronounced in the normal ductal epithelial cell line human pancreatic Nestin-expressing cell or in pancreatic cancer cell lines exposed to an irrelevant control oligonucleotide. Inhibition of miR-21 and miR-221 increased the amount of apoptosis in HS766T cells by 3- to 6-fold compared with the control oligonucleotide. HS766T cells exposed to miR-21 antisense resulted in cell cycle arrest (G1 phase). Protein levels of tumor suppressor targets of the miRNAs were increased by antisense to miR-21 (PTEN and RECK) and miR-221 (p27). Antisense to miR-21 and miR-221 sensitized the effects of gemcitabine, and the antisense-gemcitabine combinations were synergistic at high fraction affected. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that antisense to miR-21 and miR-221 results in significant cell killing under various conditions and that antisense oligonucleotides targeted to miRNA represents a potential new therapy for pancreatic cancer.",

The type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes and its simplified derivative, the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system, have emerged as potent new tools for targeted gene knockout in bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish and human cells. Here, we describe adaptations of these systems leading to successful expression of the Cas9/sgRNA system in two dicot plant species, Arabidopsis and tobacco, and two monocot crop species, rice and sorghum. Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used for delivery of genes encoding Cas9, sgRNA and a non-fuctional, mutant green fluorescence protein (GFP) to Arabidopsis and tobacco. The mutant GFP gene contained target sites in its 5' coding regions that were successfully cleaved by a CAS9/sgRNA complex that, along with error-prone DNA repair, resulted in creation of functional GFP genes. DNA sequencing confirmed Cas9/sgRNA-mediated mutagenesis at the target site. Rice protoplast cells transformed with Cas9/sgRNA constructs targeting the promoter region of the bacterial blight susceptibility genes, OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET11, were confirmed by DNA sequencing to contain mutated DNA sequences at the target sites. Successful demonstration of the Cas9/sgRNA system in model plant and crop species bodes well for its near-term use as a facile and powerful means of plant genetic engineering for scientific and agricultural applications.",

Immunocytochemistry has revealed that nerve fibers within the neural and intermediate lobes of the rat pituitary gland contain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Recent anatomical evidence suggests that the content of this amine in the intermediate but not the neural lobe of the pituitary gland may represent 5-HT that has been taken up from the blood rather than synthesized intraneuronally. The purpose of this study was to determine if 5-HT is synthesized in neurons of the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. 5-HT synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in the neurointermediate lobe of male Long-Evans rats following the administration of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Thirty min following the injection of NSD 1015 (100 mg/kg, i.p.), 5-HTP accumulated in the neurointermediate lobe and the rate of this accumulation was increased by the administration of the 5-HTP precursor, tryptophan, and by electrical stimulation of the pituitary stalk. In addition, repeated injections of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p., every 12 h for a total of 7 injections), induced a marked depletion of platelet 5-HT but did not alter the concentration of 5-HT in either the neural or intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. Taken together these results indicate that much of the 5-HT in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland does not represent 5-HT taken up from the blood, but rather the amine is synthesized in neurons projecting to this region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification, and Akt SUMOylation was found to regulate cell proliferation, tumorigenesis and cell cycle, but the molecular mechanism of Akt SUMOylation is less well known. Here, we show both endogenous and ectopic Akt SUMOylation and Lys276 is the major SUMO acceptor on Akt. Further, Akt SUMOylation is Akt phosphorylation dependent and Akt SUMOylation increases Akt kinase activity without affecting the phosphorylation level of Akt. Moreover, endogenous Akt SUMOylation is enhanced by insulin treatment and this is Akt activity dependent. Heat-shock stimulus also increases Akt SUMOylation and it is also Akt activity dependent. Endogenous Akt SUMOylation is also found in the rat brain and it is enhanced by insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation. In addition, Akt directly phosphorylates Ubc9 at Thr35 and phosphorylates SUMO1 at Thr76. Ubc9 phosphorylation at Thr35 promotes Ubc9 thioester bond formation and SUMO1 phosphorylation at Thr76 stabilizes the SUMO1 protein. Through these distinct mechanisms, Akt SUMOylation regulates global SUMOylation, including Akt and Ubc9 SUMOylation, and substrate SUMOylation specificity, including STAT1 and CREB SUMOylation, in different manners. Akt SUMOylation also enhances phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) SUMOylation through Akt phosphorylation of Ubc9 and SUMO1, which serves as an endogenous mechanism to stop the positive feedback loop resulted from Akt activation. Further, Akt SUMOylation increases cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation, and these effects are also mediated through Ubc9 phosphorylation at Thr35 and SUMO1 phosphorylation at Thr76. Here, we have identified a novel mechanism for SUMOylation regulation. Because of the important role Akt plays in tumorigenesis, this mechanism may also be involved in Akt-regulated tumorigenesis.",

This study explored the feasibility of molecular profiling to determine the correlation between HER-2 expression, hormonal sensitivity, and the antitumor effects of trastuzumab and paclitaxel in patients with prostate carcinoma. METHODS: Patients with progressive androgen dependent (AD) and androgen independent (AI) prostate carcinoma were eligible to participate in the study. HER-2 expression was assessed on pretreatment tissue specimens, and patients were then assigned to one of four treatment groups: AD HER-2 positive, AD HER-2 negative, AI HER-2 positive, and AI HER-2 negative. They were treated with weekly trastuzumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) until they experienced disease progression, when weekly paclitaxel at 100 mg/m(2) was added. RESULTS: The authors screened 130 patients for HER-2 expression. In total, 23 patients were treated. Six eligible patients had HER-2 positive disease; therefore, only the AI HER-2 negative arm accrued to completion. All patients (100%) experienced disease progression on trastuzumab alone at or before the first 12 weeks of treatment. Fifteen patients received combined therapy: Seven patients (47%) experienced disease progression, 5 patients (33%) had stable disease, and 3 patients (20%) had a decline > or = 50% in prostate specific antigen PSA level or in soft tissue disease. HER-2 overexpression was found in significant proportions only in AI metastatic tissue samples (42% HER-2 positive; 95% confidence interval, 14-60%). In three of nine matched pairs, the AD prostate biopsy was HER-2 negative, and the AI metastatic sample was HER-2 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab is not effective as a single agent for the treatment of patients with AI HER-2 negative tumors. HER-2 expression varies by clinical state in patients with prostate carcinoma: Accurate HER-2 profiling requires sampling metastatic tissue in patients with metastatic disease. Further development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2 positive tumors.",

PURPOSE: Conventional postoperative photon-beam radiotherapy to the spine in children with medulloblastoma/PNET is associated with severe late effects. This morbidity (growth and developmental) is related to the exit dose of the beams and is particularly severe in young children. With the purpose of reducing this toxicity, a dosimetric study was undertaken in which proton therapy was compared to standard megavoltage photon treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The results of a comparative dosimetric study are presented in such a way that the dose distribution achievable with a posterior modulated 100 MeV proton beam (spot scanning method) is compared with that of a standard set of posterior 6 MV x-ray fields. The potential improvements with protons are evaluated, using dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the target as well as the dose to the vertebral bodies (growth plates), lungs, heart, and liver. RESULTS: The target (i.e., the spinal dural sac) received the full prescribed dose in both treatment plans. However, the proportions of the vertebral body volume receiving > or = 50% of the prescribed dose were 100 and 20% for 6 MV x-rays and protons, respectively. For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET. The potential bone marrow and growth arrest sparing effects make this approach specially attractive for intensive chemotherapy protocols and for very young children. Sparing the thyroid gland, the posterior heart wall, and the gonads may be additional advantages in assuring a long-term posttreatment morbidity-free survival.",

BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. However, the vast majority of ovarian and breast cancer cases do not display the hereditary form of the disease. Estrogen-metabolizing genes may also contribute to the predisposition of breast or ovarian cancer. Polymorphic variants of the estrogen-metabolizing gene, CYP17, have been associated with the risk of hormone-related cancers. In this study we investigated the CYP17 polymorphisms in ovarian cancer patients harboring mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, patients displaying familial characteristics but not carrying mutations and patients with sporadic ovarian cancer. Association between the allele frequencies, the CYP17 genotype and tumor characteristics or clinical parameters was evaluated. Our data suggest evidence for an association between ovarian cancer risk and the CYP17 genotype in the subgroup of patients with familial disease in whom no mutations in the BRCA genes are found. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the genotype distribution between the control group and the subgroup of patients with BRCA mutations, the frequency of the CYP17 A2 allele was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients without BRCA mutations. We found a four- to eightfold higher risk in ovarian cancer patients with family history but without BRCA mutations. Our data indicate that the CYP17 A2 allele polymorphism may confer an increased risk and can provide a biomarker for ovarian cancer patients in whom no mutations in the BRCA genes are observed.",

To model NSCLC development in vivo, we used the extensively characterized LSL-KRas(G12D) murine model of NSCLC. We show that loss of Scrib and activated oncogenic KRas cooperate in vivo, resulting in more aggressive lung tumors, likely due to a synergistic elevation in RAS-MAPK signaling.

PURPOSE: We performed a phase I study of a day (D) 1 and D4 bortezomib administration once every 2 weeks to determine the recommended phase II dose and toxicity profile, and the extent of 20S proteasome inhibition obtained. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with solid tumors or lymphomas were treated with bortezomib at 0.25 to 1.9 mg/m2 on D1 and D4, every 2 weeks. 20S proteasome levels in blood were assayed at baseline and at 1, 4, and 24 hours postdose in cycle 1. RESULTS: On this D1 and D4 every 2 weeks' schedule, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evident at the 1.75 and 1.9 mg/m2 dose levels, most commonly in patients receiving individual total doses > or = 3.0 mg. The main DLT was peripheral neuropathy evident at the higher doses and in patients previously exposed to neurotoxic agents. Other DLTs included diarrhea and fatigue; grade 3 thrombocytopenia was also noted. Reversible inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was dose dependent and best fit a total dose (mg) per fraction rather than mg/m2; 70% of baseline activity was inhibited by a dose of 3.0 to 3.5 mg given on D1 and on D4 every other week.

CONCLUSION: Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.0 mg (equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week.

Our analysis shows that aCNEs have been evolving at different rates in different bony vertebrate lineages. Although 78-83% of CNEs have diverged beyond recognition (\"lost\") in different teleost fishes, only 24% and 40% have been lost in the chicken and mammalian lineages, respectively. Relative rate tests of substitution rates in CNEs revealed that the teleost fish CNEs have been evolving at a significantly higher rate than those in other bony vertebrates. In the ray-finned fish lineage, 68% of aCNEs were lost before the divergence of the four teleosts. This implicates the \"fish-specific\" whole-genome duplication in the accelerated evolution and the loss of a large number of both copies of duplicated CNEs in teleost fishes. The aCNEs are rich in tissue-specific enhancers and thus many of them are likely to be evolutionarily constrained cis-regulatory elements. The rapid evolution of aCNEs might have affected the expression patterns driven by them.

BACKGROUND: The packaging of DNA into chromatin regulates transcription from initiation through 3' end processing. One aspect of transcription in which chromatin plays a poorly understood role is the co-transcriptional splicing of pre-mRNA. RESULTS: Here we provide evidence that H2B monoubiquitylation (H2BK123ub1) marks introns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A genome-wide map of H2BK123ub1 in this organism reveals that this modification is enriched in coding regions and that its levels peak at the transcribed regions of two characteristic subgroups of genes. First, long genes are more likely to have higher levels of H2BK123ub1, correlating with the postulated role of this modification in preventing cryptic transcription initiation in ORFs. Second, genes that are highly transcribed also have high levels of H2BK123ub1, including the ribosomal protein genes, which comprise the majority of intron-containing genes in yeast. H2BK123ub1 is also a feature of introns in the yeast genome, and the disruption of this modification alters the intragenic distribution of H3 trimethylation on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which functionally correlates with alternative RNA splicing in humans. In addition, the deletion of genes encoding the U2 snRNP subunits, Lea1 or Msl1, in combination with an htb-K123R mutation, leads to synthetic lethality. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that H2BK123ub1 facilitates cross talk between chromatin and pre-mRNA splicing by modulating the distribution of intronic and exonic histone modifications.",

Sister-chromatid cohesion, the process of pairing replicated chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis, is mediated through the essential cohesin complex and a number of nonessential cohesion genes, but the specific roles of these nonessential genes in sister-chromatid cohesion remain to be clarified. We analyzed sister-chromatid cohesion in double mutants of mrc1Delta, tof1Delta, and csm3Delta and identified additive cohesion defects that indicated the existence of at least two pathways that contribute to sister-chromatid cohesion. To understand the relationship of other nonessential cohesion genes with respect to these two pathways, pairwise combinations of deletion and temperature-sensitive alleles were tested for cohesion defects. These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1. Furthermore, we found that the nonessential genes are not important for the maintenance of cohesion at G(2)/M. Thus, our data suggest that nonessential cohesion genes make critical redundant contributions to the establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion and define two cohesion pathways, thereby establishing a framework for understanding the role of nonessential genes in sister-chromatid cohesion.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between prenatal antibiotics, including erythromycin, and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a large cohort of infants. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of births to women enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid/TennCare, 1985-1997. Prescriptions for erythromycin, nonerythromycin macrolides, and other antibiotics were identified from pharmacy files linked with birth certificate files. The primary study outcome was development of pyloric stenosis in the infant, identified from linked hospital discharge diagnosis and surgical procedure codes. RESULTS: The cohort included 260,799 mother/infant pairs. Among these women, 13,146 filled prescriptions for erythromycin (50.4 per 1000), and 621 filled prescriptions for nonerythromycin macrolides (2.4 per 1000). There was no association with prenatal erythromycin prescription and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis either after 32 weeks' gestation (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval, 0.84, 1.64, P =.33) or at any time during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.84, 1.56, P =.36). There was an association between maternal prescriptions for nonerythromycin macrolides and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (adjusted odds ratio 2.77, 95% confidence interval 1.22, 6.30, P =.01). CONCLUSION: The hypothesized association between erythromycin and infantile pyloric stenosis was not seen.

Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain \"shadow\" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes [1]. They nonetheless produce patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to those produced by more proximal primary enhancers. It was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations [2, 3]. We critically tested this hypothesis by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods [2, 4]. Evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus. Removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly perturb snail function, including the repression of neurogenic genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at normal temperatures. However, at elevated temperatures, there is sporadic loss of snail expression and coincident disruptions in gastrulation. Similar defects are observed at normal temperatures upon reductions in the levels of Dorsal, a key activator of snail expression (reviewed in [5]). These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes \"bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions\" [6].",

The expression of recombinant PLN-L39stop in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and adult rat cardiomyocytes showed no PLN inhibition of SR Ca(2+)-ATPase and the virtual absence of stable PLN expression; where PLN was expressed, it was misrouted to the cytosol or plasma membrane.

Studies on the neuroprotective and promyelinating effects of progesterone in the nervous system are of great interest due to their potential clinical connotations. In peripheral neuropathies, progesterone and reduced derivatives promote remyelination, axonal regeneration and the recovery of function. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), progesterone has the ability to reduce edema and inflammatory cytokines, prevent neuronal loss and improve functional outcomes. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury. In experimental spinal cord injury (SCI), molecular markers of functional motoneurons become impaired, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA, Na,K-ATPase mRNA, microtubule-associated protein 2 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). SCI also produces motoneuron chromatolysis. Progesterone treatment restores the expression of these molecules while chromatolysis subsided. SCI also causes oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination. In this case, a short progesterone treatment enhances proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into mature myelin-producing cells, whereas prolonged treatment increases a transcription factor (Olig1) needed to repair injury-induced demyelination. Progesterone neuroprotection has also been shown in motoneuron neurodegeneration. In Wobbler mice spinal cord, progesterone reverses the impaired expression of BDNF, ChAT and Na,K-ATPase, prevents vacuolar motoneuron degeneration and the development of mitochondrial abnormalities, while functionally increases muscle strength and the survival of Wobbler mice. Multiple mechanisms contribute to these progesterone effects, and the role played by classical nuclear receptors, extra nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, and the reduced metabolites of progesterone in neuroprotection and myelin formation remain an exciting field worth of exploration.",

Mice administrated with 0.1% SSC had significantly decreased serum glucose and insulin levels, lower homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index, and area under the blood glucose curve, suggesting that insulin sensitivity is enhanced by dietary SSC. Dietary SSC also prevented adipokine imbalance, by increasing adiponectin production and decreasing tumor necrosis factor alpha level caused by high-fat diet.

OBJECTIVES: The development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by multiple genetic alterations. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma. METHODS: In our study, we examined the expression levels of uc.43, uc.73, uc.134, uc.230, uc.339, uc.388 and uc.399 in 54 samples of primary colorectal carcinomas and 15 samples of non-tumoral adjacent tissues by real-time PCR. T-UCR expression levels were also correlated with commonly used clinicopathological features of CRC. RESULTS: Expression levels of uc.73 (p = 0.0139) and uc.388 (p = 0.0325) were significantly decreased in CRC tissue, and uc.73 indicated a positive correlation with overall survival (p = 0.0315). The lower expression of uc.388 was associated with the distal location of CRC (p = 0.0183), but no correlation of any evaluated T-UCR with clinical stage, grade and tumor diameter was observed.

Bile acids (BAs) are recently recognized key signaling molecules that control integrative metabolism and energy expenditure. BAs activate multiple signaling pathways, including those of nuclear receptors, primarily farnesoid X receptor (FXR), membrane BA receptors, and FXR-induced FGF19 to regulate the fed-state metabolism. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) has been implicated as a key mediator of these BA signaling pathways by recruitment of chromatin modifying proteins, but the key question of how SHP transduces BA signaling into repressive histone modifications at liver metabolic genes remains unknown. Here we show that protein kinase C\u03b6 (PKC\u03b6) is activated by BA or FGF19 and phosphorylates SHP at Thr-55 and that Thr-55 phosphorylation is critical for the epigenomic coordinator functions of SHP. PKC\u03b6 is coimmunopreciptitated with SHP and both are recruited to SHP target genes after bile acid or FGF19 treatment. Activated phosphorylated PKC\u03b6 and phosphorylated SHP are predominantly located in the nucleus after FGF19 treatment. Phosphorylation at Thr-55 is required for subsequent methylation at Arg-57, a naturally occurring mutation site in metabolic syndrome patients. Thr-55 phosphorylation increases interaction of SHP with chromatin modifiers and their occupancy at selective BA-responsive genes. This molecular cascade leads to repressive modifications of histones at metabolic target genes, and consequently, decreased BA pools and hepatic triglyceride levels. Remarkably, mutation of Thr-55 attenuates these SHP-mediated epigenomic and metabolic effects. This study identifies PKC\u03b6 as a novel key upstream regulator of BA-regulated SHP function, revealing the role of Thr-55 phosphorylation in epigenomic regulation of liver metabolism.",

BACKGROUND: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLr) in hepatocytes, and its expression in mouse liver has been shown to decrease with fenofibrate treatment. METHODS: We developed a sandwich ELISA using recombinant human PCSK9 protein and 2 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against human PCSK9. We measured circulating PCSK9 concentrations in 115 diabetic patients from the FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes) study before and after fenofibrate treatment. RESULTS: We found that plasma PCSK9 concentrations correlate with total (r = 0.45, P = 0.006) and LDL (r = 0.54, P = 0.001) cholesterol but not with triglycerides or HDL cholesterol concentrations in that cohort. After 6 weeks of treatment with comicronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day), plasma PCSK9 concentrations decreased by 8.5% (P = 0.041 vs pretreatment). This decrease correlated with the efficacy of fenofibrate, as judged by a parallel reduction in plasma triglycerides (r = 0.31, P = 0.015) and LDL cholesterol concentrations (r = 0.27, P = 0.048).

METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on blinded samples from eleven individuals with PCC/PGL and known mutations. Illumina TruSeq (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for exome capture of seven samples, and NimbleGen SeqCap EZ v3.0 (Roche NimbleGen Inc, Basel, Switzerland) for five samples (one sample was repeated). Massive parallel sequencing was performed on multiplexed samples. Sequencing data were called using Genome Analysis Toolkit and annotated using annovar. Data were assessed for coding variants in RET, NF1, VHL, SDHD, SDHB, SDHC, SDHA, SDHAF2, KIF1B, TMEM127, EGLN1 and MAX. Target capture of five exome capture platforms was compared. RESULTS: Six of seven mutations were detected using Illumina TruSeq exome capture. All five mutations were detected using NimbleGen SeqCap EZ v3.0 platform, including the mutation missed using Illumina TruSeq capture. Target capture for exons in known PCC/PGL genes differs substantially between platforms. Exome sequencing was inexpensive (<$A800 per sample for reagents) and rapid (results <5 weeks from sample reception). CONCLUSION: Whole exome sequencing is sensitive, rapid and efficient for detection of PCC/PGL germline mutations. However, capture platform selection is critical to maximize sensitivity.",

Early onset dementia and marked involvement of frontal regions are features characterizing both NHD and other kinds of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), and, in some cases, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in TREM2 coding region were screened by allelic discrimination in a population of probable AD patients as well as FTLD patients as compared with age-matched controls. In addition, mutation scanning of the coding region of TREM2 gene was carried out in 7 patients with early onset AD (EOAD), 16 FTLD, and 20 controls. None of the SNPs analyzed was present, either in patients or controls. Moreover, mutation scanning of the five exons of TREM2 failed to detect the presence of novel polymorphisms.

They are resistant to all current therapies and are associated with a high rate of recurrence. Glioblastoma were previously shown to respond to treatments by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) mainly by activating a necrotic type of cell death. The receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) has recently been outlined as a key mediator of this caspase-independent form of programmed cell death. In the present study, we analyzed the necrotic mechanism induced by 5-ALA-PDT in human glioblastoma cells and explored the role of RIP3 in this context. Our results show that PDT-induced necrosis is dependent on RIP3, which forms aggregates and colocalizes with RIP1 following photosensitization. We demonstrate that PDT-mediated singlet oxygen production is the cause of RIP3-dependent necrotic pathway activation. We also prove that PDT induces the formation of a pro-necrotic complex containing RIP3 and RIP1 but lacking caspase-8 and FADD, two proteins usually part of the necrosome when TNF-\u03b1 is used as a stimulus. Thus, we hypothesize that PDT might lead to the formation of a different necrosome whose components, besides RIP1 and RIP3, are still unknown. In most cases, glioblastoma are characterized by a constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB. This factor is a key regulator of various processes, such as inflammation, immune response, cell growth or apoptosis. Its inhibition was shown to further sensitize glioblastoma cells to PDT-induced necrosis, however, no difference in RIP3 upshift or aggregation could be observed when NF-\u03baB was inhibited.",

One mutant (asf1-33(ts)) was mated with mutants in 77 different kinase genes to identify synthetic lethal combinations. The asf1-33 mutant required the DNA damage checkpoint factors Chk1 and Rad3 for its survival at the restrictive temperature. Chk1, but not Cds1, was phosphorylated in the asf1-33 mutant at the restrictive temperature, indicating that the DNA damage checkpoint was activated in the asf1-33 mutant. DNA damage occured in the asf1-33 mutant, with degradation of the chromosomal DNA observed through pulse-field gel electrophoresis and the formation of Rad22 foci. Sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease in the asf1-33 mutant was increased compared to the asf1(+) strain at the restrictive temperature, suggesting that asf1 mutations also caused a defect in overall chromatin structure. The Asf1-33 mutant protein was mislocalized and incapable of binding histones. Furthermore, histone H3 levels at the centromeric outer repeat region were decreased in the asf1-33 mutant and heterochromatin structure was impaired. Finally, sim3, which encodes a CenH3 histone chaperone, was identified as a strong suppressor of the asf1-33 mutant.

Several new antidepressants that inhibit the serotonin (SERT) and norepinephrine transporters (NET) have been introduced into clinical practice the past several years. This report focuses on the further pharmacologic characterization of nefazodone and its metabolites within the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, in comparison with other antidepressants. By use of radioligand binding assays, we measured the affinity (Ki) of 13 antidepressants and 6 metabolites for the rat and human SERT and NET. The Ki values for eight of the antidepressants and three metabolites were also determined for the rat 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, the guinea pig histamine1 receptor and the human alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors. These data are useful for predicting side effect profiles and the potential for pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions of antidepressants. Of particular interest were the findings that paroxetine, generally thought of as a selective SERT antagonist, possesses moderately high affinity for the NET and that venlafaxine, which has been described as a \"dual uptake inhibitor\", possesses weak affinity for the NET. We observed significant correlations in SERT (r = 0.965) or NET (r = 0.983) affinity between rat and human transporters. Significant correlations were also observed between muscarinic cholinergic and NET affinity. There are several significant correlations between affinities for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, histamine1, alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors. These novel findings, not widely described previously, suggest that many of the individual drugs studied in these experiments possess some structural characteristic that determines affinity for several G protein-coupled, but not muscarinic, receptors.",

PURPOSE: This phase III open-label study compared the efficacy and safety of enzastaurin versus lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (WHO grade 4). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 6-week cycles of enzastaurin 500 mg/d (1,125-mg loading dose, day 1) or lomustine (100 to 130 mg/m(2), day 1). Assuming a 45% improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), 397 patients were required to provide 80% power to achieve statistical significance at a one-sided level of .025. RESULTS: Enrollment was terminated at 266 patients (enzastaurin, n = 174; lomustine, n = 92) after a planned interim analysis for futility. Patient characteristics were balanced between arms. Median PFS (1.5 v 1.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.70), overall survival (6.6 v 7.1 months; HR = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.65), and 6-month PFS rate (P = .13) did not differ significantly between enzastaurin and lomustine, respectively. Stable disease occurred in 38.5% and 35.9% of patients and objective response occurred in 2.9% and 4.3% of patients, respectively. Time to deterioration of physical and functional well-being and symptoms did not differ between arms (HR = 1.12; P = .54). Four patients discontinued enzastaurin because of drug-related serious adverse events (AEs). Eleven patients treated with enzastaurin died on study (four because of AEs; one was drug-related). All four deaths that occurred in patients receiving lomustine were disease-related. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities were significantly higher with lomustine (46 events) than with enzastaurin (one event; P < or = .001). CONCLUSION: Enzastaurin was well tolerated and had a better hematologic toxicity profile but did not have superior efficacy compared with lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious lesion inflicted by ionizing radiation. Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells. We previously demonstrated that complex DSBs induced by high-linear energy transfer (LET) Fe ions are repaired slowly and incompletely, whereas those induced by low-LET gamma rays are repaired efficiently by mammalian cells. To determine whether Fe-induced DSBs are more potently tumorigenic than gamma ray-induced breaks, we irradiated 'sensitized' murine astrocytes that were deficient in Ink4a and Arf tumor suppressors and injected the surviving cells subcutaneously into nude mice. Using this model system, we find that Fe ions are potently tumorigenic, generating tumors with significantly higher frequency and shorter latency compared with tumors generated by gamma rays. Tumor formation by Fe-irradiated cells is accompanied by rampant genomic instability and multiple genomic changes, the most interesting of which is loss of the p15/Ink4b tumor suppressor due to deletion of a chromosomal region harboring the CDKN2A and CDKN2B loci. The additional loss of p15/Ink4b in tumors derived from cells that are already deficient in p16/Ink4a bolsters the hypothesis that p15 plays an important role in tumor suppression, especially in the absence of p16. Indeed, we find that reexpression of p15 in tumor-derived cells significantly attenuates the tumorigenic potential of these cells, indicating that p15 loss may be a critical event in tumorigenesis triggered by complex DSBs.",

Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival. In this respect, members of the FoxO family are extremely compelling to consider since these transcription factors have emerged as versatile proteins that can control angiogenesis, stem cell proliferation, cell adhesion and autoimmune disease.

Antibody to the Her-2/neu gene product has been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells overexpressing Her-2/neu and to have clinical utility in treating breast cancer. We studied a recombinant, humanized anti-Her-2/neu antibody (Herceptin) in preclinical models of human prostate cancer. The androgen-dependent CWR22 and LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft models and androgen-independent sublines of CWR22 were used. Her-2/neu staining of the parental, androgen-dependent, and androgen-independent CWR22 tumors and LNCaP tumors demonstrated variable Her-2/neu expression. Herceptin was administered i.p. at a dose of 20 mg/kg twice weekly after the xenograft had been established. No effect of Herceptin on tumor growth was observed in any of the androgen-independent tumors; however, significant growth inhibition was observed in both of the androgen-dependent xenograft models, CWR22 (68% growth inhibition at the completion of the experiment; P = 0.03 for trajectories of the average tumor volume of the groups) and LNCaP (89% growth inhibition; P = 0.002). There was a significant increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) index (ng PSA/ml serum/mm3 tumor) in Herceptin-treated androgen-dependent groups compared with control (CWR22, 18-fold relative to pretreatment value versus 1.0-fold, P = 0.0001; LNCaP, 2.35-fold relative to pretreatment value versus 0.6-fold, P = 0.001). When paclitaxel (6.25 mg/kg s.c., five times/week) was given to animals with androgen-dependent and -independent tumors, there was growth inhibition in each group. Paclitaxel and Herceptin cotreatment led to greater growth inhibition than was seen for the agents individually. Thus, in these prostate cancer model systems, Herceptin alone has clinical activity only in the androgen-dependent tumor and has at least an additive effect on growth, in combination with paclitaxel, in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent tumors. Response to Herceptin did not correlate with the PSA levels, because the PSA index markedly increased in the Herceptin-treated group, whereas it remained constant in the control group.

Second, we found that a cryptic 5'ss enhances the selection of a more upstream site and demonstrate that this is mediated by binding of U1 snRNA to the cryptic splice site, challenging the traditional role attributed to U1 snRNA of binding the 5'ss only. Third, we used a simple algorithm to identify specific sequences that determine splice site selection within specific Alu exons. Finally, by inserting identical exons within different sequences, we demonstrated the importance of flanking genomic sequences in determining whether an Alu exon will undergo exonization. Overall, our results demonstrate the complex interplay between at least four interacting layers that affect Alu exonization.

Using perforated-patch recordings, both medium and slow afterhyperpolarization currents (mI(AHP) and sI(AHP), respectively) could be obtained from pyramidal cells that were cultured for 8-15 days. The sI(AHP) demonstrated the kinetics and pharmacologic characteristics reported for pyramidal cells in slices. In addition to confirming the insensitivity to 100 nM apamin and 1 mM TEA, we have shown that the sI(AHP) is also insensitive to 100 nM charybdotoxin but is inhibited by 100 microM D-tubocurarine. Concentrations of nifedipine (10 microM) and nimodipine (3 microM) that maximally inhibit L-type calcium channels reduced the sI(AHP) by 30 and 50%, respectively. However, higher concentrations of nimodipine (10 microM) abolished the sI(AHP), which can be partially explained by an effect on action potentials. Both nifedipine and nimodipine at maximal concentrations were found to reduce the HVA calcium current in freshly dissociated neurons to the same extent. The N-type calcium channel inhibitor, omega-conotoxin GVIA (100 nM), irreversibly inhibited the sI(AHP) by 37%. Together, omega-conotoxin (100 nM) and nifedipine (10 microM) inhibited the sI(AHP) by 70%. 10 microM ryanodine also reduced the sI(AHP) by 30%, suggesting a role for calcium-induced calcium release.

Elevated expression of ELMO1 and Dock180 was also found in various human glioma cell lines compared with normal human astrocytes. Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation. Conversely, exogenous expression of ELMO1 and Dock180 in glioma cells with low level endogenous expression increased their migratory and invasive capacity in vitro and in brain tissue.

DESIGN: A cohort study on plasma samples. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Basel. PATIENTS: A total of 101 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to the medical ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Venous blood samples were routinely obtained at entry, on day 2, and at discharge or before death. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma samples were obtained from 101 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock. PTX3 plasma levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PTX3 was elevated in critically ill patients, with a gradient from systemic inflammatory response syndrome to septic shock. PTX3 levels correlated with clinical scores reflecting severity of disease (e.g., Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II: p =.00097). In addition, high levels of PTX3 were associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The long pentraxin PTX3 is elevated in critically ill patients and correlates with severity of disease and infection. Compared with the short pentraxin C-reactive protein, PTX3 may be a more direct indicator of tissue involvement by inflammatory and infectious processes.",

PURPOSE: Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous chromosomal breakage disorder exhibiting a high degree of clinical variability. Clinical diagnoses are confirmed by testing patient cells for increased sensitivity to crosslinking agents. Fanconi anemia complementation group assignment, essential for efficient molecular diagnosis of the disease, had not been validated for clinical application before this study. The purpose of this study was (1) confirmation of the accuracy of Fanconi anemia complementation group assignment to Group A (FANCA) and (2) development of a rapid mutation detection strategy that ensures the efficient capture of all FANCA mutations. METHODS: Using fibroblasts from 29 patients, diagnosis of Fanconi anemia and assignment to complementation Group A was made through breakage analysis studies. FANCA coding and flanking sequences were analyzed using denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography, sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Patients in which two mutations were not identified were analyzed by cDNA sequencing. Patients with no mutations were sequenced for mutations in FANCC, G, E, and F. RESULTS: Of the 56 putative mutant alleles studied, 89% had an identifiable FANCA pathogenic mutation. Eight unique novel mutations were identified.

Neurons regulate ionic fluxes across their plasma membrane to maintain their excitable properties under varying environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms that regulate ion channels abundance remain poorly understood.

We demonstrate that the mRNA 3'UTR of ppk29 affects neuronal firing rates and associated heat-induced seizures by acting as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that regulates the neuronal mRNA levels of seizure (sei), the Drosophila homolog of the human Ether-\u00e0-go-go Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. We find that the regulatory impact of ppk29 mRNA on sei is independent of the sodium channel it encodes.

FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase contributing to migration and proliferation downstream of integrin and/or growth factor receptor signaling of normal and malignant cells. In addition to well-characterized tyrosine phosphorylations, FAK is phosphorylated on several serines, whose role is not yet clarified. We observed that phosphorylated FAK on serine 732 (P-FAKSer732) is present at variable levels in vitro, in several melanoma, ovarian and thyroid tumor cell lines and in vivo, in tumor cells present in fresh ovarian cancer ascites. In vitro P-FAKSer732 was barely detectable during interphase while its levels strongly increased in mitotic cells upon activation of the EGFR/MEK/ERK axis in an integrin-independent manner. P-FAKSer732 presence was crucial for the maintenance of the proliferation rate and its levels were inversely related to the levels of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin. P-FAKSer732 localized at the microtubules (MTs) of the spindle, biochemically associated with MTs and contributed to MT depolymerization. The lack of the phosphorylation on Ser732 as well as the inhibition of CDK5 activity by roscovitine impaired mitotic spindle assembly and correct chromosome alignment during mitosis. We also identified, for the first time, that the EGF-dependent EGFR activation led to increased P-FAKSer732 and polymerized MTs. Our data shed light on the multifunctional roles of FAK in neoplastic cells, being involved not only in integrin-dependent migratory signaling but also in integrin-independent MT dynamics and mitosis control.

BACKGROUND: Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. Over-expression of wild-type or constitutively active forms of RhoA has been shown to induce invasive behavior in non-invasive rat hepatoma cells in vitro. In addition, over-expression of RhoC has been found in melanoma cells with increasing metastatic activity as well as inflammatory breast cancer. These results indicate that overexpression of Rho proteins contributes to cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) was recently shown to act as a metastasis suppressor gene in bladder cancer. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of this gene expression in patients with colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: Fifty pairs of normal mucosa and cancer specimens obtained at the time of surgery from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for RhoGDI2. RESULTS: No patients with RhoGDI2-higher expression tumors had liver metastasis (0 in 8 cases); however, 33.3% (14 in 42 cases) of patients with RhoGDI2-lower expression tumors had liver metastasis. With regard to outcome in relation to RhoGDI2-positivity, RhoGDI2-higher expression tumors had a significant correlation with superior relapse-free survival (RFS) time as compared to RhoGDI2-lower expression tumors in stage III CRC (log-rank test, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, multivariate analysis indicated that RhoGDI2 was an independent prognostic factor for RFS. CONCLUSION: RhoGDI2 is a novel predictor of RFS in patients with colorectal carcinoma.",

BACKGROUND: Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a highly heterogeneous genetic disease. Thus, identification of disease-causing mutations is a challenging and time-consuming task. Genotype-phenotype associations may alleviate identification of the underlying mutation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac phenotypes within a family harboring a familial dilated cardiomyopathy-related mutation in the gene encoding phospholamban. METHODS: Complete genetic and clinical analyses were performed in a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. Family relatives were studied by ECG, Holter ECG, echocardiography, ECG body surface potential mapping, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A candidate gene approach resulted in identification of a heterozygous deletion of arginine 14 in the gene encoding phospholamban (PLN-R14Del) segregating with dilated cardiomyopathy in the family pedigree. Mutation carriers suffered from familial dilated cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac death between the ages of 26 and 50 years. Interestingly, all adult mutation carriers revealed strikingly attenuated R amplitudes on standard ECG, regardless of the absence or presence of echocardiographic abnormalities. Gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed late enhancement in PLN-R14Del carriers with preserved ejection fraction. Late enhancement was regionally related to areas of most pronounced R-amplitude attenuation as assessed by body surface potential mapping. CONCLUSION: Attenuated R amplitudes were identified as an early ECG phenotype in a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. All adults harboring PLN-R14Del had attenuated R waves irrespective of echocardiographic abnormalities.

UNLABELLED: We report on mutation analysis of five genes involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) or the endothelin-signalling pathways in 28 sporadic Japanese patients with Hirschsprung disease. Analysis of DNA obtained from peripheral blood cells revealed six mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, four of which were disease-causing mutations in exon 9 (D584G), the splice donor site of intron 10 (+2T to A), exon 11 (A654T), and exon 12 (T706A). A heterozygous A to G transition was found in 47 bases upstream from the 5' end of exon 2 in two HD patients but was also seen in one control subject (2/28; 1/24). A silent 2307T to G transversion was observed in exon 13. Two disease-causing mutations were detected in the endothelin receptor (EDNRB) gene, in the non-coding region of exon 1 (-26 G to A) and in exon 4 (A301T); the latter mutation was a novel one. One silent mutation was observed in exon 4 (codon 277). One heterozygous T to C mutation was found in the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor gene in 25 bases upstream of the coding region in exon 1. No nucleotide changes were detected in either the endothelin-3 or neurturin genes. Disease-causing mutation rates in the RET proto-oncogene and the EDNRB gene were estimated at 14.3% (4/28) and 10.7% (3/28), respectively. In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. Further systematic studies of genetic variation in a large series of patients and controls are necessary for elucidating the pathogenesis of this disorder. CONCLUSION: This study provides further gene alterations as disease-causing mutations in Japanese cases of sporadic Hirschsprung disease. However, the low mutation rate of the susceptibility genes may indicate that Hirschsprung disease arises from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.",

The p16-cyclin D-pRB-E2F pathway is frequently deregulated in human tumors. This critical regulatory pathway controls the G1/S transition of the mammalian cell cycle by positive and negative regulation of E2F-responsive genes required for DNA replication. To assess the value of the transcription factors E2Fs as targets for antiproliferative strategies, we have initiated a program aiming to develop inhibitors targeting specifically these proteins in vitro and in vivo. The cellular activity of E2F is the result of the heterodimeric association of two families of proteins, E2Fs and DPs, which then bind DNA. Here, we use a two hybrid approach to isolate from combinatorial libraries peptide aptamers that specifically interact with E2Fs DNA binding and dimerization domains. One of these is a potent inhibitor of E2F binding activity in vitro and in mammalian fibroblasts, blocks cells in G1, and the free variable region from this aptamer has the same effect. Our experiments argue that the variable region of this aptamer is structured, and that it functions by binding E2F with a motif that resembles a DP heterodimerization region, and blocking E2F's association with DP. These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators. These results also emphasize the critical role of the E2F pathway for cell proliferation and might allow the design of novel antiproliferative agents targeting the cyclin/CDK-pRB-E2F pathway.",

Treatment of hepatitis C patients with direct-acting antiviral drugs involves the combination of multiple small-molecule inhibitors of distinctive mechanisms of action. ACH-806 (or GS-9132) is a novel, small-molecule inhibitor specific for hepatitis C virus (HCV). It inhibits viral RNA replication in HCV replicon cells and was active in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients in a proof-of-concept clinical trial (1). Here, we describe a potential mechanism of action (MoA) wherein ACH-806 alters viral replication complex (RC) composition and function. We found that ACH-806 did not affect HCV polyprotein translation and processing, the early events of the formation of HCV RC. Instead, ACH-806 triggered the formation of a homodimeric form of NS4A with a size of 14 kDa (p14) both in replicon cells and in Huh-7 cells where NS4A was expressed alone. p14 production was negatively regulated by NS3, and its appearance in turn was associated with reductions in NS3 and, especially, NS4A content in RCs due to their accelerated degradation. A previously described resistance substitution near the N terminus of NS3, where NS3 interacts with NS4A, attenuated the reduction of NS3 and NS4A conferred by ACH-806 treatment. Taken together, we show that the compositional changes in viral RCs are associated with the antiviral activity of ACH-806.

Although deamidation is considered to be a side-reaction occurring in the absence of suitable amines or at a low pH, a recent paper reported the selective deamidation of the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20), suggesting that deamidation could be a substrate dependent event. Here we have measured peptide deamidation and transamidation in the same reaction to reveal factors that affect the relative propensity for the two possible products. We report that the propensity for deamidation by TG2 is both substrate dependent and influenced by the reaction conditions. Direct deamidation is favored for poor substrates and at low concentrations of active TG2, while indirect deamidation (i.e. hydrolysis of transamidated product) can significantly contribute to the deamidation of good peptide substrates at higher enzyme concentrations. Further, we report for the first time that TG2 can hydrolyze iso-peptide bonds between two peptide substrates.

The neurotoxicant, trimethyltin (TMT) produces cochlear impairment at far lower dose levels and far more rapidly than it does central nervous system effects. The initial effects of TMT in the cochlea, in vivo, are consistent with disruption of the inner hair cell type-1 spiral ganglion cell synapse although it is uncertain whether the effect is on presynaptic and/or postsynaptic units. This synapse is believed to be an excitatory glutamatergic one, providing the possibility that TMT could induce an excitotoxic process resulting in elevations in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). The objective of this study was to determine whether TMT had direct toxic effects on the postsynaptic spiral ganglion cells studied in primary culture and to identify the role of extracellular calcium in such an effect. The marker of interest was the effect of this agent on [Ca2+]i levels as determined using quantitation of the fluorescent calcium dye, Fura-2. TMT did induce a marked and sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i level in the spiral ganglion cells that appeared to have a rapid initial phase and a slower saturating phase. Studies performed using calcium-free medium showed that elevation of [Ca2+]i in spiral ganglion cells by TMT was attenuated but not entirely blocked. Further, the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, was able to inhibit the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that at least this phase of the TMT effect was mediated by calcium channels, although nifedipine had no significant effect on the time to reach the maximal [Ca2+]i level. Parallel control experiments performed using application of exogenous glutamate and depolarizing K+ concentrations also produced elevation in [Ca2+]i levels. The data indicate that TMT elevates [Ca2+]i in isolated spiral ganglion cells both by increasing extracellular uptake via Ca2+ channels and also by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Thus TMT ototoxicity appears to include a direct postsynaptic toxic event.",

BACKGROUND: Mutations in BRCA1/2 genes confer ovarian, alongside breast, cancer risk. We examined the risk of developing ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2-positive families and if this risk is extended to BRCA negative families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study involving women seen at a single family history clinic in Manchester, UK. Patients were excluded if they had ovarian cancer or oophorectomy prior to clinic. Follow-up was censored at the latest date of: 31/12/2010; ovarian cancer diagnosis; oophorectomy; or death. We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population. RESULTS: We studied 8005 women from 895 families. Women from BRCA2 mutation families showed a 17-fold increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer (relative risk (RR) 16.67; 95% CI 5.41 to 38.89). This risk increased to 50-fold in women from families with BRCA1 mutations (RR 50.00; 95% CI 26.62 to 85.50).

Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)]. To study such relationships, various SV40- and Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed human cell lines derived from normal, A-T, or UV-sensitive xeroderma pigmentosum donors have been assayed for their sensitivity to mAMSA together with direct and indirect measurements of topoisomerase II expression. We report on the identification of an SV40-transformed A-T fibroblast cell line with abnormally high levels of topoisomerase II in nuclear protein extracts as determined by immunoblotting, measurement of kinetoplast DNA decatenation activity, and mAMSA-dependent DNA-protein cross-linking activity in a filter binding assay. Using a flow cytometric assay for the analysis of reactivity of nuclei with a polyclonal antitopoisomerase II antibody, overproduction was found to occur in all phases of the cell cycle. High levels of topoisomerase II were associated with hypersensitivity (5-10-fold) to mAMSA-induced cell cycle delay, cell kill, and DNA strand breakage (assayed under protein-denaturing conditions). Xeroderma pigmentosum (group A) cells demonstrated normal responses to mAMSA. The results provide evidence that cellular potential for the generation of topoisomerase II-dependent DNA damage is a major factor in governing the sensitivity to mAMSA. Furthermore, underexpression of topoisomerase II does not appear to be a primary factor in describing the in vitro A-T phenotype. The findings also relate to how changes in chromatin structure and function may either reflect or dictate the expression of topoisomerase II in human cells.",

Dabigatran etexilate is an oral, reversible direct thrombin inhibitor that is approved in the EU and several other countries for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective hip and knee replacement, and is in advanced clinical development for other thromboembolic disorders. Dabigatran has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, allowing for a fixed-dose regimen without the need for routine coagulation monitoring. In certain clinical situations such as serious bleeding into critical organs (e.g. intracerebral bleeding), potential overdose and emergency surgery, clinicians will need to make an assessment of the anticoagulant status of a patient receiving dabigatran before deciding on future management strategies. If available, thrombin clotting time (TT), ecarin clotting time (ECT) and TT determined by Hemoclot thrombin inhibitor assay are sensitive tests to evaluate the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. Prothrombin time (INR) is less sensitive than other assays and cannot be recommended. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) can provide a useful qualitative assessment of anticoagulant activity but is less sensitive at supratherapeutic dabigatran levels. There are limited data for activated clotting time (ACT). Overall, the aPTT and TT are the most accessible qualitative methods for determining the presence or absence of anticoagulant effect. Although there is no specific antidote to antagonise the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, due to its short duration of effect drug discontinuation is usually sufficient to reverse any excessive anticoagulant activity. In case of potential overdose, the feasibility of early administration of activated charcoal and subsequent charcoal filtration are undergoing preclinical evaluation. Dabigatran can also be dialysed in patients with renal impairment. In instances of life-threatening bleeding, where conventional measures have failed or are unavailable, other non-specific prohaemostatic agents such as recombinant activated factor VII and prothrombin complex concentrates can be considered.",

Circadian clocks govern the mammalian physiology in a day/night-dependent manner. The circadian oscillator of peripheral organs is composed of the same elements as the central pacemaker at the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The interaction between the circadian clock and several cell cycle components has been established in recent years, since many key regulators of cell cycle and growth control were proved to be rhythmically expressed. In particular, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been documented to be under circadian regulation. Given that it is overexpressed in many malignancies, the study of c-Myc mRNA and c-MYC protein regulation by the circadian clock is of great interest. Thus, the aim of this work was to: (a) analyze in detail the circadian oscillations of c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels and to investigate whether c-MYC protein levels display any oscillating pattern, and (b) ascertain whether circadian time is important for reducing c-MYC levels after drug application. For this purpose, we selected trichostatin A (TSA), since it is known that long (>or=12 h) treatment durations negatively influence the expression levels of c-Myc and short 2 h treatments up regulate the expression of the central oscillator gene Per1 resulting in the resetting of its rhythm. TSA is a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), and its application results in increased acetylation levels of histone and non-histone proteins. Our results, using the murine neuroblastoma cell line N2A, show that Per1 and c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels oscillate with the same phase. Moreover, a short 2 h TSA treatment causes a phase-dependent decrease of oscillating c-Myc transcript levels only when applied at the trough of its mRNA rhythm, where a general decrease of c-MYC protein levels is also observed. At the peak of its rhythm, no apparent changes can be observed. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that a significant decrease in c-Myc transcript and protein levels can be achieved after a short TSA treatment applied only at specific circadian times. This is also followed by a reduction in the proliferation rate of the cell population.",

Endothelin-3-endothelin receptor B signaling pathway is known to play an essential role in this process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implication of the EDN3 and EDNRB genes in a series of patients with Hirschsprung disease from Spain and determinate their mutational spectrum. METHODS: We performed the mutational screening of both genes in 196 patients with Hirschsprung disease using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography technology. A case-control study using TaqMan Technology was also carried out to evaluate some common polymorphisms and haplotypes as susceptibility factors for Hirschsprung disease. RESULTS: Besides several novel mutations in both genes, we found a truncating mutation in an alternative isoform of EDNRB. Interestingly, we obtained an overrepresentation of a specific EDN3 haplotype in cases versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the isoform EDNRB Delta 3 might be playing an essential role in the formation of enteric nervous system. In addition, based on the haplotype distribution, EDN3 might be considered as a common susceptibility gene for sporadic Hirschsprung disease in a low-penetrance fashion.",

OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of modafinil on parkinsonism and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), as well as on negative symptoms and cognitive abilities in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV criteria) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 8-week study. METHODS: Twenty-four male patients, who were aged 20-63 years and on stable dose of second generation antipsychotic medications and with a negative symptom score of > 20 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), were randomized into either the modafinil (n=12) or placebo (n=12) group. The modafinil group received flexible does of modafinil 50-200mg/day. Primary measurements were the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) for extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the PANSS and a neuropsychological (NP) test battery. Data were collected on Days 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56 for rating scales, and on Days 0, 28 and 56 for NP tests. RESULTS: Mixed model analyses showed a significant group-x-time interaction for total SAS scores (P<0.006), with scores decreasing in the modafinil group but remaining the same in the placebo group. There were no significant group-x-time interactions for scores of ESS (total), PANSS (total, positive and negative), and NP tests (composite and domains) (all P's>0.5).

MHC class II expression requires recruitment of a master regulator, the class II transactivator (CIITA), to the MHC class II promoter. Post-translational modifications to CIITA play important roles in modulating CIITA mediated transcription of various genes in different cell types.

The leukocyte integrin p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) is involved in a number of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and mediates signal transduction into the cytoplasm. p150,95 is expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage as well as on certain activated T and B lymphocytes, and its expression is regulated during cell activation and differentiation. Since CD18 is expressed on all leukocyte lineages, the restricted expression of p150,95 must be controlled at the level of CD11c gene transcription. To understand the mechanisms that direct the constitutive and regulated leukocyte expression of p150,95 we have structurally characterized the CD11c promoter region and initiated its functional dissection. The CD11c promoter lacks TATA- and CCAAT-boxes, directs the synthesis of transcripts with heterogeneous 5'-ends, and contains an initiator-like sequence at the major transcription initiation site. Several putative binding sequences for ubiquitous (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB) and leukocyte-specific (PU.1) transcription factors have been identified in the proximal region of the CD11c promoter which may participate in the regulation of the expression of p150,95. Transient expression of CD11c-based reporter gene constructs indicates that the CD11c promoter dictates the tissue-specific expression of p150,95 and that sequences contained within 160 base pairs 5' from the major transcriptional start site are involved in the tissue-specific and regulated expression of p150,95. DNase I protection analysis on the promoter region spanning from -160 to +40 revealed four regions of DNA-protein interactions (FPI-FPIV), two of which (FPII and FPIV) correlate with the cell type-specific and regulated expression of the CD11c gene.",

Focal adhesion proteins link cell surface integrins and intracellular actin stress fibers and therefore play an important role in mechanotransduction and cell motility. When endothelial cells are subjected to cyclic mechanical strain, time-lapse imaging revealed that cells underwent significant morphological changes with their resultant long axes aligned away from the strain direction. To explore how this response is regulated by focal adhesion-associated proteins the expression levels of paxillin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and zyxin were knocked down using gene silencing techniques. In addition, rescue of endogenous and two mutant zyxins were used to investigate the specific role of zyxin interactions. Cells with decreased zyxin expression levels and rescue with the mutant lacking zyxin/alpha-actinin binding exhibited lower orientation angles after comparable times of stretching as compared to normal and control cells. However, knockdown of the expression levels of paxillin and FAK and rescue with the mutant lacking zyxin/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) binding did not significantly affect the degree of cell orientation. In addition, wound closure speed and cell-substratum adhesive strength were observed to be significantly reduced only for cells with zyxin depletion and the mutation lacking zyxin/alpha-actinin binding.

Forty percent of the neutrophils completely lost Fc gamma RIII, and the remainder of the cells showed a 60% decrease in Fc gamma RIII expression on their surface. Released Fc gamma RIII was detected in the culture supernatant. Nevertheless, more than 90% of the cells was viable as judged by hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate. The presence of interferon gamma, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but not interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, or IL-8, in the culture medium increased the number of cells that still expressed Fc gamma RIII. We found that this loss of Fc gamma RIII was not the result of cell activation but correlated strongly with apoptosis. The Fc gamma RIII-negative subpopulation exhibited typical morphologic changes, such as nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, this subpopulation appeared to have acquired the property of binding Annexin V, a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for phosphatidylserine. The external exposure of this phospholipid by cells has been reported to occur during apoptosis. The property of Annexin V binding was not shared by the nonapoptotic, Fc gamma RIII-positive subpopulation.

Mutation of CTCF-binding sites in plasmid-borne promoters reduced transcriptional activity in an orientation-dependent manner. Depletion of CTCF by shRNA led to a decrease in TERRA transcription, and a loss of cohesin and RNAPII binding to the subtelomeres. Depletion of either CTCF or cohesin subunit Rad21 caused telomere-induced DNA damage foci (TIF) formation, and destabilized TRF1 and TRF2 binding to the TTAGGG proximal subtelomere DNA.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of fracture after onset of MG. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the UK General Practice Research Database (1987-2009). Each MG patient was matched by age, sex, calendar time and practice to up to six patients without a history of MG and we identified all fractures and those associated with osteoporosis. RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0.98 [95 % CI 0.67-1.41]). Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.31-3.14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure. However, fracture risk was higher in patients with MG prescribed antidepressants (AHR 3.27 [95 % CI, 1.63-6.55]), anxiolytics (AHR 2.18 [95 % CI, 1.04-4.57]) and anticonvulsants (AHR 6.88 [95 % CI, 2.91-16.27]). CONCLUSION: Overall risk of fracture in patients with MG is not statistically increased compared with age- and gender-matched controls irrespective of glucocorticoid use but was increased in those using antidepressants, anxiolytics or anticonvulsants. These findings have implications in strategies preserving bone health in patients with MG.",

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterised by intestinal obstruction due to an absence of intramural ganglia along variable lengths of the intestine. RET is the major gene involved in HSCR. Mutations in the GDNF gene, and encoding one of the RET ligands, either alone or in combination with RET mutations, can also cause HSCR, as can mutations in four other genes (EDN3, EDNRB, ECE1, and SOX10). The rare mutations in the latter four genes, however, are more or less restricted to HSCR associated with specific phenotypes. We have developed a novel comprehensive mutation detection system to analyse all but three amplicons of the RET and GDNF genes, based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. We make use of two urea-formamide gradients on top of each other, allowing mutation detection over a broad range of melting temperatures. For the three remaining (GC-rich) PCR fragments we use a combination of DGGE and constant denaturing gel electrophoresis (CDGE). These two dual gel systems substantially facilitate mutation scanning of RET and GDNF, and may also serve as a model to develop mutation detection systems for other disease genes. In a screening of 95 HSCR patients, RET mutations were found in nine out of 17 familial cases (53%), all containing long segment HSCR. In 11 of 78 sporadic cases (14%), none had long segment HSCR. Only one GDNF mutation was found, in a sporadic case.",

INTRODUCTION: Models of the multistep process related to cancer progression have been designed for many cancers including prostate. The aim of this study is to propose a new model including a possible role for recently described micro RNAs in prostate cancer (CaP) progression. METHODS: Sixty-three patients underwent radical prostatectomy to treat localized prostate carcinoma. The specimens of 15 patients were representative of high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). Fourteen specimens represented localized favorable CaP, and 34 unfavorable, mostly non-organ-confined disease. Representing the advanced disease we studied 4 metastatic androgen-independent CaP and 2 cell lines. Micro RNAs were isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit and cDNA was obtained using the TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription kit to the miRNAs: hsa-miR-let7c, hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-25, hsa-miR-32, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-199a, hsa-miR-206, and hsa-miR-218. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System and the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix. miRNA expression levels were measured by relative quantification, and fold expression changes were determined by the 2(-\u0394\u0394CT) method. The small nucleolar RNA RNU43 was used as an endogenous control. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. Interestingly, there was a significant global loss of miRNA expression between HGPIN and metastasis at 2 important steps. The first was related to the transition from HGPIN to invasive adenocarcinoma, and the second was related to the transition from localized to metastatic adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION: Through the analysis of 14 miRNAs in 4 groups of prostate lesions, which reproduced the progression of CaP, we showed that there is a global loss of miRNA expression at 2 distinct steps. The first related to the transition between HGPIN and localized invasive carcinoma, and the second associated with the transition from localized to metastatic CaP. The importance of our study is in the identification of possible miRNAs and miRNA-targeted genes involved in the progression of prostate carcinogenesis that may help the development of potential diagnostic or prognostic markers as well as the design of new target therapies.",

Chemokines mediate diverse fundamental biological processes, including combating infection. Multiple chemokines are expressed at the site of infection; thus chemokine synergy by heterodimer formation may play a role in determining function. Chemokine function involves interactions with G-protein-coupled receptors and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG). However, very little is known regarding heterodimer structural features and receptor and GAG interactions. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics characterization of platelet-derived chemokine CXCL7 heterodimerization with chemokines CXCL1, CXCL4, and CXCL8 indicated that packing interactions promote CXCL7-CXCL1 and CXCL7-CXCL4 heterodimers, and electrostatic repulsive interactions disfavor the CXCL7-CXCL8 heterodimer. As characterizing the native heterodimer is challenging due to interference from monomers and homodimers, we engineered a \"trapped\" disulfide-linked CXCL7-CXCL1 heterodimer. NMR and modeling studies indicated that GAG heparin binding to the heterodimer is distinctly different from the CXCL7 monomer and that the GAG-bound heterodimer is unlikely to bind the receptor. Interestingly, the trapped heterodimer was highly active in a Ca release assay. These data collectively suggest that GAG interactions play a prominent role in determining heterodimer function in vivo. Further, this study provides proof-of-concept that the disulfide trapping strategy can serve as a valuable tool for characterizing the structural and functional features of a chemokine heterodimer.",

Members of the CyP40-type cyclophilins have originally been described as components of hormone receptor complexes. Here, we describe NcCyP41, a CyP40 ortholog from Neurospora crassa, its expression in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification. Characterization of NcCyP41 reveals that it is a heat shock protein, which is active as a cyclosporin A-sensitive PPIase. Affinity chromatography using immobilized recombinant NcCyP41 yielded two major NcCyP41-binding proteins: Hsp80 (a Hsp90 ortholog from N.crassa) and CyPBP37. CyPBP37 has not been described. In addition, this is the first record describing an interaction between a member of Cyp40-type cyclophilins and of CyPBP37-type proteins, respectively. CyPBP37 expression is repressed by thiamine and in the stationary phase in N.crassa. CyPBP37 is present in different isoforms. The expression of a CyPBP37 ortholog in yeast, Thi4p, is diminished in a mutant lacking one of the two CyP40 orthologs (Cpr7p).

Previous work has demonstrated the importance of protein kinase C in regulating glioma cell proliferation in vitro. Tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor when administered in high dosages, is currently being used as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. The patient in the present study harbored a left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma adjacent to Broca's area and the paracentral region, which limited gross resection. After a subtotal resection of the tumor and after radiation, the patient was administered high-dose tamoxifen therapy for gross residual gadolinium-enhancing regions that were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and by high glucose uptake as demonstrated by positron emission tomography. After treatment, a decrease in gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance images and a decrease in glucose uptake revealed by positron emission tomography were noted. A laboratory examination of the tissue obtained from the original surgical resection revealed resistance to radiation therapy but sensitivity to tamoxifen as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The subsequent in vitro testing of the tumor that was removed after the recurrence of tumor (22 months after the initiation of tamoxifen) revealed loss of sensitivity to tamoxifen. However, the recurrent tumor remained sensitive to growth inhibition by the potent protein kinase C inhibitor, hypericin, despite loss of sensitivity to tamoxifen in vitro, suggesting the potential clinical application of this agent.

There is growing evidence that the host innate immune system has a critical role in regulating carcinogenesis, but the specific receptors involved and the importance of their interaction with commensal bacteria need to be elucidated. Two major classes of innate immune receptors, the Toll-like receptors and Nod-like receptors, many of which are upstream of nuclear factor-kappaB, are involved in the detection of intestinal bacteria. The Toll-like receptors have been implicated in promoting colon tumorigenesis, but the role of Nod-like receptors in regulating tumorigenesis remains unclear. Using an established mouse model system of colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis, we show that Nod1 deficiency results in the increased development of both colitis-associated and Apc tumor suppressor-related colon tumors. In the absence of Nod1 signaling, there is a greater disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier due to chemically induced injury as manifested by increased surface epithelial apoptosis early on during chemically induced colitis and increased intestinal permeability. The increased intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and epithelial cell proliferation in Nod1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Depletion of the gut microbiota suppressed tumor development in Nod1-deficient mice, thus highlighting a link between the commensal bacteria within the intestine and the host innate immune Nod1 signaling pathway in the regulation inflammation-mediated colon cancer development.",

We report here that adult mice conditionally deficient for the transcription Growth factor independence 1b (Gfi1b) show a significant expansion of functional HSCs in the bone marrow and blood.

Treatment of Gfi1b(ko/ko) mice with N-acetyl-cystein significantly reduced HSC numbers indicating that increased reactive oxygen species levels are at least partially responsible for the expansion of Gfi1b-deficient HSCs. Moreover, Gfi1b(-/-) HSCs show decreased expression of CXCR4 and Vascular cell adhesion protein-1, which are required to retain dormant HSCs in the endosteal niche, suggesting that Gfi1b regulates HSC dormancy and pool size without affecting their function. Finally, the additional deletion of the related Gfi1 gene in Gfi1b(ko/ko) HSCs is incompatible with the maintenance of HSCs, suggesting that Gfi1b and Gfi1 have partially overlapping functions but that at least one Gfi gene is essential for the generation of HSCs.",

Microphthalmos is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by reduced eye size and visual deficits of variable degree. Sporadic and hereditary microphthalmos have been associated with heterozygous mutations in genes fundamental for eye development. Yet, many cases are idiopathic or await the identification of molecular causes. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of Meis1, which encodes a transcription factor with evolutionarily conserved expression in the embryonic trunk, brain and sensory organs, including the eye, causes microphthalmic traits and visual impairment in adult mice. By combining analysis of Meis1 loss-of-function and conditional Meis1 functional rescue with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches we show that, in contrast to its preferential association with Hox-Pbx BSs in the trunk, Meis1 binds to Hox/Pbx-independent sites during optic cup development. In the eye primordium, Meis1 coordinates, in a dose-dependent manner, retinal proliferation and differentiation by regulating genes responsible for human microphthalmia and components of the Notch signaling pathway. In addition, Meis1 is required for eye patterning by controlling a set of eye territory-specific transcription factors, so that in Meis1(-/-) embryos boundaries among the different eye territories are shifted or blurred. We propose that Meis1 is at the core of a genetic network implicated in eye patterning/microphthalmia, and represents an additional candidate for syndromic cases of these ocular malformations.",

To determine the extent of cross signaling between Ca2+ and cAMP pathways, we have investigated the beta-adrenergic-induced phosphorylation of Ser16 and Thr17 of phospholamban in perfused rat hearts using antibodies recognizing phospholamban phosphorylated at either position. Isoproterenol caused the dose-dependent phosphorylation of Ser16 and Thr17 with strikingly different half-maximal values (EC50 = 4.5 +/- 1.6 and 28. 2 +/- 1.4 nmol/l, respectively). The phosphorylation of Ser16 induced by isoproterenol, forskolin, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine correlated to increased cardiac relaxation (r = 0.96), whereas phosphorylation of Thr17 did not. Elevation of extracellular Ca2+ did not induce phosphorylation at Thr17; only in the presence of a submaximal dose of isoproterenol, phosphorylation at Thr17 increased eightfold without additional effects on relaxation rate. Thr17 phosphorylation was partially affected by ryanodine and was completely abolished in the presence of 1 micromol/l verapamil or nifedipine. The data indicate that 1) phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is the main regulator of beta-adrenergic-induced cardiac relaxation definitely preceding Thr17 phosphorylation and 2) the beta-adrenergic-mediated phosphorylation of Thr17 by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase required influx of Ca2+ through the L-type Ca2+ channel.",

When compared with the historical database stratified by recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, this end point was not different [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.18; 95\u00a0% CI: 0.95-1.46; P\u00a0=\u00a00.93].

In all, 34\u00a0% of patients discontinued thalidomide because of adverse events or refusal. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were venous thrombosis, fatigue, skin reactions, encephalopathy, and neuropathy. In conclusion, thalidomide given simultaneously with radiation therapy was safe, but did not improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.",

None of the responders progressed to end stage renal disease, whereas five (38%) non-responders required dialysis or renal transplantation. Patients with IgAN who have steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome likely have both minimal change disease and IgAN.

Our model of phospholamban (PLB) regulation of the cardiac Ca(2+)-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) states that PLB binds to the Ca(2+)-free, E2 conformation of SERCA2a and blocks it from transitioning from E2 to E1, the Ca(2+)-bound state. PLB and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive, and PLB inhibition of SERCA2a is manifested as a decreased apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca(2+). Here we extend this model to explain the reversal of SERCA2a inhibition that occurs after phosphorylation of PLB at Ser(16) by protein kinase A (PKA) and after binding of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12, which recognizes residues 7-13 of PLB. Site-specific cysteine variants of PLB were co-expressed with SERCA2a, and the effects of PKA phosphorylation and 2D12 on Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and cross-linking to SERCA2a were monitored. In Ca(2+)-ATPase assays, PKA phosphorylation and 2D12 partially and completely reversed SERCA2a inhibition by decreasing K(Ca) values for enzyme activation, respectively. In cross-linking assays, cross-linking of PKA-phosphorylated PLB to SERCA2a was inhibited at only two of eight sites when conducted in the absence of Ca(2+) favoring E2. However, at a subsaturating Ca(2+) concentration supporting some E1, cross-linking of phosphorylated PLB to SERCA2a was attenuated at all eight sites. K(Ca) values for cross-linking inhibition were decreased nearly 2-fold at all sites by PLB phosphorylation, demonstrating that phosphorylated PLB binds more weakly to SERCA2a than dephosphorylated PLB. In parallel assays, 2D12 blocked PLB cross-linking to SERCA2a at all eight sites regardless of Ca(2+) concentration. Our results demonstrate that 2D12 restores maximal Ca(2+)-ATPase activity by physically disrupting the binding interaction between PLB and SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLB by PKA weakens the binding interaction between PLB and SERCA2a (yielding more PLB-free SERCA2a molecules at intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations), only partially restoring Ca(2+) affinity and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity.",

Macroautophagy maintains cellular homeostasis through targeting cytoplasmic contents and organelles into autophagosomes for degradation. This process begins with the assembly of protein complexes on isolation membrane to initiate the formation of autophagosome, followed by its nucleation, elongation and maturation. Fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes then leads to degradation of the cargo. In the past decade, significant advances have been made on the identification of molecular players that are implicated in various stages of macroautophagy. Post-translational modifications of macroautophagy regulators have also been demonstrated to be critical for the selective targeting of cytoplasmic contents into autophagosomes. In addition, recent demonstration of distinct macroautophagy regulators has led to the identification of different subtypes of macroautophagy. Since deregulation of macroautophagy is implicated in diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, cancers and inflammatory disorders, understanding the molecular machinery of macroautophagy is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms by which macroautophagy is deregulated in these diseases, thereby revealing new potential therapeutic targets and strategies.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the cytotoxic effects of the fluoquinolone ofloxacin and the aminoglycoside netilmicin on stromal human keratocytes in vitro. METHODS: Cultured human keratocytes were exposed to various concentrations of ofloxacin or netilmicin (0.16-5.0 mg/mL). Both cell proliferation (MTT assay) and cell morphology (phase-contrast microscopy) were evaluated after 1, 4, 12, and 24 hours of incubation. Measurement of annexin V binding performed in association with the dye exclusion test using propidium iodide (PI) was also performed by FACS analysis after 4 hours of exposure. RESULTS: Both antimicrobials induced dose- and time-dependent morphologic changes in keratocytes, yet the effects of netilmicin were minimal. After 24 hours of exposure, both drugs induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation; however, ofloxacin demonstrated significantly more toxic effects than netilmicin (t test for ED50 values, P < 0.0001). Statistical differences between 2 antibiotics start at concentrations above 1.25 mg/mL (ANOVA with post-hoc test, P < 0.01). Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus netilmicin, ANOVA, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Relative effects of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones on stromal keratocytes appear to be different: netilmicin was shown to be significantly less toxic than ofloxacin. This finding is particularly relevant in deciding the optimal antibiotic to be applied in clinical situations in which the epithelium is absent or compromised, as after photorefractive keratectomy, alkali burns, or ulcerative keratitis.",

In mammalian cells RNA polymerase II efficiently transcribes nucleosome-packaged DNA. In this regard, a fundamental question concerns the nature and mechanism of action of the accessory factors that are necessary and sufficient for, or enhance, transcription through nucleosomal arrays by RNA polymerase II. Here we describe a highly purified system that allows for efficient activator-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II from the promoter through several contiguous nucleosomes on defined chromatin templates. The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). As examples of the applicability of this system for mechanistic analyses of these and other factors, representative experiments show (i) that activated transcription from chromatin templates is concomitantly dependent on the activator, p300-mediated histone acetylation and elongation factor SII/TFIIS. (ii) that SII/TFIIS acts in a highly synergistic manner with p300 (and histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and (iii) that SII/TFIIS works directly at the elongation step of chromatin transcription. Here we describe purification methods for the different factors employed and the specific transcriptional assays that led to the above-mentioned conclusions.

Here we show that R432 within the helix-turn-helix motif is critical for sequence-specific recognition, as the R432A mutation abolishes its TIR-specific DNA binding activity. Metnase possesses a unique DNA nicking and/or endonuclease activity that mediates cleavage of duplex DNA in the absence of the TIR sequence. While the HTH motif is essential for the Metnase-TIR interaction, it is not required for its DNA cleavage activity. The DDE-like motif is crucial for its DNA cleavage action as a point mutation at this motif (D483A) abolished its DNA cleavage activity.

Encephalitis induced by reovirus serotype 3 (T3) strains results from the apoptotic death of infected neurons. Extrinsic apoptotic signaling is activated in reovirus-infected neurons in vitro and in vivo, but the role of intrinsic apoptosis signaling during encephalitis is largely unknown. Bax plays a key role in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. We found Bax activation and cytochrome c release in neurons following infection of neonatal mice with T3 reoviruses. Bax(-/-) mice infected with T3 Abney (T3A) have reduced central nervous system (CNS) tissue injury and decreased apoptosis, despite viral replication that is similar to that in wild-type (WT) Bax(+/+) mice. In contrast, in the heart, T3A-infected Bax(-/-) mice have viral growth, caspase activation, and injury comparable to those in WT mice, indicating that the role of Bax in pathogenesis is organ specific. Nonmyocarditic T3 Dearing (T3D)-infected Bax(-/-) mice had delayed disease and enhanced survival compared to WT mice. T3D-infected Bax(-/-) mice had significantly lower viral titers and levels of activated caspase 3 in the brain despite unaffected transneuronal spread of virus. Cytochrome c and Smac release occurred in some reovirus-infected neurons in the absence of Bax; however, this was clearly reduced compared to levels seen in Bax(+/+) wild-type mice, indicating that Bax is necessary for efficient activation of proapoptotic mitochondrial signaling in infected neurons.

RESULTS: The median patient age was six years (range=3-14 years). The primary diagnoses were glioblastoma multiforme (n=2), medullobalstoma (n=2), pontine glioma (n=1) and ependymoma (n=1). All patients had disease refractory to standard-of-care (2-3 prior systemic therapies). Grade 3 toxicities possibly related to drugs used occurred in two patients: anorexia, nausea, and weight loss in one, and thrombocytopenia and alanine aminotransferase elevation in another. One patient with glioblastoma multiforme achieved a partial response (51% regression) and two patients (with medulloblastoma and pontine glioma) had stable disease for four months or more (20 and 47 weeks, respectively).

The regulatory role of protein kinase C (PKC) in glycogen metabolism in pectin fed rats was investigated. Administration of pectin (5 g/kg body wt/day) from cucumber (Cucumis sativius L.) led to inhibitory effects on PKC activity in the liver of rats. In the brain and pancreas, PKC activity was significantly higher in pectin-treated rats as compared to the control group. Level of blood glucose was significantly lowered and the level of glycogen in the liver was significantly increased in pectin-administered rats. Glycogen synthase activity was enhanced, while glycogen phosphorylase enzyme showed inhibition in pectin-treated rats. Results indicated that pectin administration might have caused an increase in the secretion of the insulin, which, in turn, had a stimulatory effect on the PKC activity in the pancreas. The decreased PKC activity in the liver and increased PKC activity in the brain and pancreas on pectin administration indicated enhanced glycogenesis and reduced glycogenolysis.",

The diverse morphologies of animal tissues are underlain by different configurations of adherent cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin \u03b15. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy within the zebrafish paraxial mesoderm mesenchyme reveals a physical association between Integrin \u03b15 on adjacent cell membranes. This Integrin-Integrin complex correlates with conformationally inactive Integrin. Cadherin 2 stabilizes both the Integrin association and inactive Integrin conformation. Thus, Integrin repression within the adherent mesenchymal interior of the tissue biases Fibronectin fibrillogenesis to the tissue surface lacking cell-cell adhesions. Along nascent somite boundaries, Cadherin 2 levels decrease, becoming anti-correlated with levels of Integrin \u03b15. Simultaneously, Integrin \u03b15 clusters and adopts the active conformation and then commences ECM assembly. This cross-scale regulation of Integrin activation organizes a stereotypic pattern of ECM necessary for vertebrate body elongation and segmentation.",

Adalimumab treatment for 16 weeks improved HS lesions significantly versus placebo\u00a0(NCT00918255). OBJECTIVE: The relationship between pain and depressive symptoms and the effects of adalimumab on\u00a0each was examined in this post hoc analysis. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe HS (N=154) were randomized 1:1:1 to adalimumab 40 mg\u00a0weekly (ew), adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow), or placebo. Skin pain was assessed using a\u00a0visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100 mm). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient\u00a0Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; score > 10 indicative of depression). RESULTS: At baseline, overall mean\u00b1SD pain VAS was 54.3\u00b126.5 mm and 41.8% of patients had PHQ-9\u00a0scores > 10.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the gold-standard technique for localizing nuclear proteins in the genome. We used ChIP, in combination with deep sequencing (Seq), to study the genome-wide distribution of the Silent information regulator (Sir) complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We analyzed ChIP-Seq peaks of the Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 silencing proteins and discovered 238 unexpected euchromatic loci that exhibited enrichment of all three. Surprisingly, published ChIP-Seq datasets for the Ste12 transcription factor and the centromeric Cse4 protein indicated that these proteins were also enriched in the same euchromatic regions with the high Sir protein levels. The 238 loci, termed \"hyper-ChIPable\", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide. The apparent enrichment of various proteins at hyper-ChIPable loci was not a consequence of artifacts associated with deep sequencing methods, as confirmed by ChIP-quantitative PCR. The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations. ChIP-Seq on chromatin immunoprecipitated with a nuclear-localized GFP reproduced the above enrichment in an expression-dependent manner: induction of the GAL genes resulted in an increased ChIP signal of the GFP protein at these loci, with presumably no biological relevance. Whereas ChIP is a broadly valuable technique, some published conclusions based upon ChIP procedures may merit reevaluation in light of these findings.",

They contain protein and RNA from the glomerulus and all sections of the nephron and represent a reservoir for biomarker discovery. Current methods for the identification and quantification of urinary exosomes are time consuming and only semi-quantitative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) counts and sizes particles by measuring their Brownian motion in solution. In this study, we applied NTA to human urine and identified particles with a range of sizes. Using antibodies against the exosomal proteins CD24 and aquaporin 2 (AQP2), conjugated to a fluorophore, we could identify a subpopulation of CD24- and AQP2-positive particles of characteristic exosomal size. Extensive pre-NTA processing of urine was not necessary. However, the intra-assay variability in the measurement of exosome concentration was significantly reduced when an ultracentrifugation step preceded NTA. Without any sample processing, NTA tracked exosomal AQP2 upregulation induced by desmopressin stimulation of kidney collecting duct cells. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was also able to track changes in exosomal AQP2 concentration that followed desmopressin treatment of mice and a patient with central diabetes insipidus. When urine was stored at room temperature, 4\u00b0C or frozen, nanoparticle concentration was reduced; freezing at -80\u00b0C with the addition of protease inhibitors produced the least reduction. In conclusion, with appropriate sample storage, NTA has potential as a tool for the characterization and quantification of extracellular vesicles in human urine.",

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, most commonly resulting in the occurrence of red and silver scaly plaques. About 30% of psoriasis sufferers develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a disorder that presents with additional joint inflammation and other clinical features. At present, the most effective treatment for moderate and severe psoriasis and PsA are biologics such as antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. Biologics are costly and typically require repeated injections; hence, the development of novel, orally available, small molecular inhibitors that are less expensive to produce is highly desirable. The phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast is a small molecular inhibitor that acts by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, ultimately suppressing tumor necrosis alpha production. Apremilast has been tested in a number of psoriasis and PsA pilot and Phase II trials to evaluate its efficacy and safety. More recently, three larger double-blinded, and randomized multicenter studies demonstrate that apremilast is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis and PsA, with significantly higher numbers of apremilast-treated patients achieving endpoints of a 75% reduction compared to baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) or American College of Rheumatology-20 scores, relative to placebo. This encouraging data, along with a tolerable incidence of mild to moderate adverse events, has led to the initiation of several large Phase III trials that aim to further validate apremilast as a treatment for psoriasis and PsA.

PURPOSE: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adult humans. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma disseminates preferentially to the liver through the hematogenous system. To date, the mechanism underlying this metastatic homing is largely unknown. This study investigated the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered signaling pathways to identify the role of HGF and its downstream effectors in inducing the migration of uveal melanoma cells. METHODS: Migration of uveal melanoma cells was measured by in vitro wound healing and transwell migration assays. The expression and translocation of c-Met were detected using indirect immunofluorescence. The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways was analyzed using specific antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt. The impact of HGF treatment on the expression of cell adhesion molecules was measured using Western blotting. RESULTS: HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells. On HGF stimulation, receptor c-Met is translocated to the nucleus in a ligand-dependent manner, suggesting that c-Met may modulate the expression of genes involved in melanoma cell migration.

All of these data have suggested a rich target profile for modulators of neuronal KCNQ channels, including a variety of neuronal hyperexcitability disorders and conditions for openers, such as the epilepsies, acute pain, neuropathic pain, migraine pain and some neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. KCNQ blockers could likewise have utility in disorders characterised by neuronal hypoactivity, including cognition enhancement and perhaps disorders of mood. Emerging patent literature suggests significant interest in neuronal KCNQ modulation in the pharmaceutical industry and significant chemical diversity concerning KCNQ modulation.",

Musclin is a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor found in the signal sequence trap of mouse skeletal muscle cDNAs. Musclin possesses a region homologous to the natriuretic peptide family. Thus, musclin is found to bind with the natriuretic peptide clearance receptors. However, the role of musclin in vascular regulation remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the direct effect of musclin on vascular tone and to analyze its role in hypertension using the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In aortic strips isolated from SHR, musclin induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. We found that the musclin-induced vasoconstriction was more marked in SHR than in normal rats (WKY). Moreover, this contraction was reduced by blockade of natriuretic peptide receptor C using the ab14355 antibody. Therefore, mediation of the natriuretic peptide receptor in musclin-induced vasoconstriction can be considered. In addition, similar to the natriuretic peptide receptor, expression of the musclin gene in blood vessels was higher in SHR than in WKY. Injection of musclin markedly increased the blood pressure in rats that can be inhibited by anti-musclin antibodies. Musclin-induced vasoconstriction was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY as in its expression. Taken together, these results suggest that musclin is involved in blood pressure regulation. The higher expression of musclin in hypertension indicates that musclin could be used as a new target for the treatment of hypertension in the future.",

Directional mutation pressure associated with replication processes is the main cause of the asymmetry between the leading and lagging DNA strands in bacterial genomes. On the other hand, the asymmetry between sense and antisense strands of protein coding sequences is a result of both mutation and selection pressures. Thus, there are two different ways of superposition of the sense strand, on the leading or lagging strand. Besides many other implications of these two possible situations, one seems to be very important - because of the asymmetric replication-associated mutation pressure, the mutation rate of genes depends on their location. Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome. We have found that the best survival strategy for the majority of genes is to sometimes switch between DNA strands. Paradoxically, this strategy results in higher substitution rates but remains in agreement with observations in bacterial genomes that such inversions are very frequent and divergence rate between homologs lying on different DNA strands is very high.",

Most of these pesticide poisoning and subsequent deaths occur in developing countries following a deliberate self ingestion of the poison. Metacid (Methyl parathion) and Nuvan (Dichlorovos) are commonly ingested OP pesticides; Dimethoate, Profenofos, and Chlorpyrifos are other less frequently ingested compounds in Nepal. The toxicity of these OP pesticides is due to the irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme leading to accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent over-activation of cholinergic receptors in various parts of the body. Acutely, these patients present with cholinergic crisis; intermediate syndrome and delayed polyneuropathy are other sequel of this form of poisoning. The diagnosis depends on the history of exposure to these pesticides, characteristic manifestations of toxicity and improvements of the signs and symptoms after administration of atropine. The supportive treatment of OP poisoning includes the same basic principles of management of any acutely poisoned patient i.e., rapid initial management of airways, breathing, and circulation. Gastric lavage and activated charcoal are routinely used decontamination procedures, but their value has not been conclusively proven in this poisoning. Atropine is the mainstay of therapy, and can reverse the life threatening features of this acute poisoning. However, there are no clear cut guidelines on the dose and duration of atropine therapy in OP poisoning. Cholinesterase reactivators, by regenerating AChE, can reverse both the nicotinic and muscarinic effects; however, this benefit has not been translated well in clinical trials. All these facts highlight that there are many unanswered questions and controversies in the management of OP poisoning and there is an urgent need for research on this aspect of this common and deadly poisoning.",

Then, we determined in each separate case the number of affected atoms, the root-mean-square distance value and the solvent-accessible surface area value. The analysis revealed that the amino acid substitutions causing a processing or transport defect responsible for Pompe disease were widely spread over all of the five domains comprising the acid alpha-glucosidase. They were distributed from the core to the surface of the enzyme molecule, and the predicted structural changes varied from large to very small. Among the structural changes, we paid particular attention to G377R and G483R. These two substitutions are predicted to cause electrostatic changes in neighboring small regions on the molecular surface. The quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum apparently detects these very small structural changes and degrades the mutant enzyme precursor (G377R), but also the cellular sorting system might be misled by these minor changes whereby the precursor is secreted instead of being transported to lysosomes (G483R).",

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory motor neurological disorder that is characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs that significantly affects the quality of life of the patient. Prevalence in the general population is 5-25% and it is twice as prevalent in women as in men. RLS is the most common movement disorder in pregnancy with a fourfold increased risk of developing this disorder later in life. The pathophysiology of RLS is centred on dopaminergic dysfunction, reduced central nervous system iron, genetic linkages, or alteration in neurotransmitters such as hypocretins, endorphins levels and immune dysfunction and inflammatory mechanisms. With the emergence of new evidence, there are changes to the previous treatment recommendations for RLS. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that dopamine agonists such as rotigotine transdermal patch, pramipexole, ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in the short-term treatment of RLS and rotigotine, followed by gabapentin enacarbil, ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin for long-term treatment. Based on expert consensus, the recommendation for daily RLS is dopamine agonists or gabapentin or low-potency opioids. Levodopa is less preferred for treating daily RLS due to its high risk of augmentation. For intermittent RLS, it is levodopa or dopamine agonists or low-potency opioids or benzodiazepines. For refractory RLS, the choice is to change to gabapentin or a different dopamine agonist, addition of a second agent like gabapentin or benzodiazepine to the existing drug or changing to a high-potency opioid or tramadol. Medications with safety record in pregnancy include opioids and antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and gabapentin. There are concerns that patients with RLS are at risk for metabolic deregulation, autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular morbidity.

Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers PLN exhibits ion channel activity with a low unitary conductance. From the effect of non-electrolyte polymers on this unitary conductance we estimate a narrow pore with a diameter of ca. 2.2 \u00c5 for this channel. This value is similar to that reported for the central pore in the structure of the PLN pentamer. Hence the PLN pentamer, which is in equilibrium with the monomer, is the most likely channel forming structure. Reconstituted PLN mutants, which either stabilize (K27A and R9C) or destabilize (I47A) the PLN pentamer and also phosphorylated PLN still generate the same unitary conductance of the wt/non-phosphorylated PLN. However the open probability of the phosphorylated PLN and of the R9C mutant is significantly lower than that of the respective wt/non-phosphorylated control. In the context of data on PLN/SERCA interaction and on Ca(2+) accumulation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum the present results are consistent with the view that PLN channel activity could participate in the balancing of charge during Ca(2+) uptake. A reduced total conductance of the K(+) transporting PLN by phosphorylation or by the R9C mutation may stimulate Ca(2+) uptake in the same way as an inhibition of K(+) channels in the SR membrane. The R9C-PLN mutation, a putative cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, might hence affect SERCA activity also via its inherent low open probability.",

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive cancer prone syndrome featuring bone marrow failure and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and, to a milder extension, to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress. Recently, we reported that human oxidative DNA glycosylase, NEIL1 excises with high efficiency the unhooked crosslinked oligomer within three-stranded DNA repair intermediate induced by photoactivated psoralen exposure. Complete reconstitution of repair of the ICL within a three-stranded DNA structure shows that it is processed in the short-patch base excision repair (BER) pathway. To examine whether the DNA damage hypersensitivity in FA cells follows impaired BER activities, we measured DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease activities in cell-free extracts from wild-type, FA, and FA-corrected cells. We showed that immortalized lymphoid cells of FA complementation Groups A, C, and D and from control cells from normal donors contain similar BER activities. Intriguingly, the cellular level of NEIL1 protein strongly depends on the intact FA pathway suggesting that the hypersensitivity of FA cells to ICLs may, at least in part, arise from downregulation or degradation of NEIL1. Consistent with this result, plasmid-based expression of the FLAG-tagged NEIL1 protein partially complements the hypersensitivity FA cells to the crosslinking agents exposures, suggesting that NEIL1 specifically complements impaired capability of FA cells to repair ICLs and oxidative DNA damage. These findings shed light to how the FA pathway may regulate DNA repair proteins and bring explanation for the long-time disputed problem of the oxidative stress sensitive phenotype of FA cells.",

Growing evidence supports an active role for dysregulated macroautophagy (autophagic stress) in neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. Alterations in mitochondrial function and dynamics are also strongly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, whereas the core autophagy machinery is evolutionarily conserved and shared among constitutive and induced or selective autophagy, recent studies implicate distinct mechanisms regulating mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in response to general autophagic stimuli. Little is known about pathways regulating selective, damage-induced mitophagy. We found that the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPP(+) induces autophagy and mitochondrial degradation that is inhibited by siRNA knockdown of autophagy proteins Atg5, Atg7 and Atg8, but occurs independently of Beclin 1, a component of the class III (PIK3C3/Vps34) phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. Instead, MPP(+)-induced mitophagy is dependent upon MAPK signaling. Interestingly, all treatments that inhibited autophagy also conferred protection from MPP(+)-induced cell death. A prior human tissue study further supports a role for ERK/MAPK-regulated autophagy in Parkinson's and Lewy body diseases. As competition for limiting amounts of Beclin 1 may serve to prevent harmful overactivation of autophagy, understanding mechanisms that bypass or complement a requirement for PI3K-Beclin 1 activity could lead to strategies to modulate autophagic stress in injured or degenerating neurons.",

Spreading depression (SD) is a slowly propagating wave of transient neuronal and glial depolarization that develops after stroke, trauma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. In compromised tissue, repetitive SD-like injury depolarizations reduce tissue viability by worsening the mismatch between blood flow and metabolism. Although the mechanism remains unknown, SDs show delayed electrophysiological recovery within the ischemic penumbra. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the recovery rate of SD can be varied by modulating tissue perfusion pressure and oxygenation. Systemic blood pressure and arterial pO(2) were simultaneously manipulated in anesthetized rats under full physiologic monitoring. We found that arterial hypotension doubled the SD duration, whereas hypertension reduced it by a third compared with normoxic normotensive rats. Hyperoxia failed to shorten the prolonged SD durations in hypotensive rats, despite restoring tissue pO(2). Indeed, varying arterial pO(2) (40 to 400 mm Hg) alone did not significantly influence SD duration, whereas blood pressure (40 to 160 mm Hg) was inversely related to SD duration in compromised tissue. These data suggest that cerebral perfusion pressure is a critical determinant of SD duration independent of tissue oxygenation over a wide range of arterial pO(2) levels, and that hypotension may be detrimental in stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage, where SD-like injury depolarizations have been observed.",

To sort the temporal and spatial regulation of EGF-dependent cytoskeletal re-organization in relation to a cell's motile behavior time-lapse microscopy was performed on EGF-responsive gastric carcinoma-derived MKN1 cells co-expressing different fluorescently labeled cytoskeletal filaments and focal adhesion components in various combinations. The experiments showed that EGF almost instantaneously induces a considerable increase in membrane ruffling and lamellipodial activity that can be inhibited by Cetuximab EGF receptor antibodies and is not elicited in non-responsive gastric carcinoma Hs746T cells. The transient cell extensions are rich in actin but lack microtubules and keratin intermediate filaments. We show that this EGF-induced increase in membrane motility can be measured by a simple image processing routine. Microtubule plus-ends subsequently invade growing cell extensions, which start to accumulate focal complexes at the lamellipodium-lamellum junction. Such paxillin-positive complexes mature into focal adhesions by tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of zyxin. These adhesions then serve as nucleation sites for keratin filaments which are used to enlarge the neighboring peripheral keratin network. Focal adhesions are either disassembled or give rise to stable zyxin-rich fibrillar adhesions which disassemble in the presence of EGF to support formation of new focal adhesion sites in the cell periphery. Taken together the results serve as a basis for modeling the early cytoskeletal EGF response as a tightly coordinated and step-wise process which is relevant for the prediction of the effectiveness of anti-EGF receptor-based tumor therapy.",

PURPOSE: NOD1 plays an important role in host defense and recognizes the minimal component of bacterial cell walls, meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP). Polymorphisms in NOD1 are associated with autoinflammatory diseases characterized by uveitis such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis. NOD1 is homologous to NOD2, which is responsible for an autosomal dominant form of uveitis. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. The induction of uveitis by iE-DAP in mice and the potential contribution of interleukin (IL)-1beta were investigated. METHODS: BALB/c mice or mice deficient in caspase-1 or IL-1R1 and their congenic controls were injected intravitreally with iE-DAP or saline. The time course, dose response, and contribution of IL-1beta to ocular inflammation were quantified by intravital video microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. NOD1 and IL-1beta were measured in eye tissue by immunoblotting and ELISA. RESULTS: NOD1 protein is expressed in the eye and promotes ocular inflammation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The authors previously defined the role of IL-1beta in NOD2 uveitis and tested whether NOD1 and NOD2 used similar mechanisms. Treatment with iE-DAP significantly increased IL-1beta, which was caspase-1 dependent. However, in contrast to NOD2, caspase-1 and IL-1R1 were essential mediators of iE-DAP-induced uveitis, suggesting that NOD1 and NOD2 induce ocular inflammation by distinct mechanisms involving IL-1beta. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that NOD1 is expressed within the eye and that its activation results in uveitis in an IL-1beta-dependent mechanism. Characterizing the differences between NOD1 and NOD2 responses may provide insight into the pathogenesis of uveitis.",

CONTEXT: Recently the first patients with inactivating mutations in T\u2083 receptor (TR)-\u03b11 have been identified. These patients have low free T\u2084, low T\u2084, high T\u2083, low rT\u2083, and normal TSH serum levels, in combination with growth retardation, delayed bone development, and constipation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to report the effects of levothyroxine (LT4) treatment on the clinical phenotype of 2 patients (father and daughter) with a heterozygous inactivating mutation in TR\u03b11. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Both patients were treated with LT4 for the last 5 years. To evaluate the effect of LT4 treatment, LT4 was withdrawn for 35 days and subsequently reinitiated. Data were collected from medical records, by reanalysis of serum collected over the last 6 years, and by a detailed clinical evaluation. RESULTS: Treatment with LT4 resulted in a suppression of serum TSH and normalization of serum free T\u2084 and rT\u2083, whereas T\u2083 levels remained elevated in both patients. In addition, there was a normalization of the dyslipidemia as well as a response in serum IGF-I, SHBG, and creatine kinase in the index patient. All these parameters returned to pretreatment values when LT4 was briefly stopped. LT4 also resulted in an improvement of certain clinical features, such as constipation and nerve conductance. However, cognitive and fine motor skill defects remained. CONCLUSION: This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a prolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation in TR\u03b11.

          "context": "Vertebral compression fractures in patients under treatment with denosumab: a contraindication for percutaneous vertebroplasty? BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Denosumab (XGeva) is a receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-antibody that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for the prevention of skeletal fractures in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Although there is a widespread use of such drug in patients under risk of pathological fractures, the compatibility of denosumab therapy with percutaneous vertebroplasty (an interventional procedure commonly used for pain control in such population) has not yet been established. PURPOSE: To present the serial imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in a patient with refractory pain and a lytic pathological vertebral fracture related to small cell lung cancer spinal metastasis and who was actively under medical treatment with denosumab. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review and case report. METHODS: The authors present the imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in the only patient found to be actively under treatment with denosumab after a retrospective review of the databank of patients with pathological fractures referred to the Department of Radiology of the Ohio State University for percutaneous vertebroplasty (a total sample of 20 patients) since the FDA approval of denosumab (November 2010) until June 2013 (a 30-month period). RESULTS: Although the computed tomography scan of the thoracic spine, performed 6 weeks after the initiation of the treatment with denosumab, presented a remarkable remodeling of the previously lytic vertebral lesion (which became markedly sclerotic in appearance), the clinical response in terms of pain improvement was not satisfactory. At the time of the percutaneous vertebroplasty (which was indicated for pain control), after advancing the 11-gauge needle through the pedicle with extreme difficulty, the needle repeatedly deviated laterally and, despite several attempts, it was not possible to penetrate the vertebral body and perform the cement injection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the technical peculiarities of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients under medical treatment with denosumab. According to our experience, because of its RANKL-mediated effects on osteoclasts activity, denosumab has been shown to induce a fast and marked sclerotic response on vertebral bodies that may not be accompanied by a satisfactory improvement in pain control (especially in patients with mechanical type of pain) and which may actually prevent the successful performance of percutaneous vertebroplasty. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that future studies evaluating patients with vertebral fractures under treatment with denosumab include long-term pain outcome measures. Additionally, further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal order of treatment and the best timeframe for combining percutaneous vertebroplasty and denosumab therapy in patients presenting with acute vertebral compression fractures and refractory axial pain.",

Mutations in the GALNT3 gene result in familial tumoral calcinosis, characterized by persistent hyperphosphatemia and ectopic calcific masses in soft tissues. Since calcific masses often recur after surgical removal, a more permanent solution to the problem is required. Nicotinamide is reported to lower serum phosphate by decreasing sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters in the gut and kidney. However, its effectiveness in tumoral calcinosis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated nicotinamide as a potential therapy for tumoral calcinosis, using a murine model of the disease-Galnt3 knockout mice. Initially, five different doses of nicotinamide were given to normal heterozygous mice intraperitoneally or orally. Treatment had no effect on serum phosphate levels, but serum levels of a phosphaturic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23), decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, high-dose nicotinamide (40mM) was tested in Galnt3 knockout mice fed a high phosphate diet. The radiographic data pre- and post-treatment showed that nicotinamide did not reverse the calcification. However, the treatment retarded calcification growth after 4weeks, while in the untreated animals, calcifications increased in size. The therapy did not affect serum phosphate levels, but intact Fgf23 decreased in the treated mice. The treated mice also had increased calcium in the heart. In summary, nicotinamide did not alter serum phosphate levels, likely due to compensatory decrease in Fgf23 to counteract the phosphate lowering effect of nicotinamide. Although increased calcium accumulation in the heart is a concern, the therapy appears to slow down the progression of ectopic calcifications.",

The beta-thalassemia syndromes are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by reduced or absent expression of the beta-globin gene. To date, over 300 beta-thalassemia alleles have been characterized in or around the beta-globin region. Thalassemia major is severe anemia necessitating chronic blood transfusions, splenectomy, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Usually thalassemia major results from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for severe betaO- and/or beta+-thalassemia mutations. Thalassemia intermedia is a clinical diagnosis that describes a symptomatic but less severe condition than beta-thalassemia major. beta-thalassemia intermedia may arise from several different combinations of alpha- and/or beta-thalassemia mutations. Heterozygous beta-thalassemia is typically characterized by a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia without any significant clinical implications. In this report, we describe a 63-year-old Africian American woman with asymptomatic homozygous beta-thalassemia, who seems to carry 2 copies of the -29 mutation in the promoter region of the beta-globin gene. Her elevated hemoglobin F level of 83% was associated with heterozygosity for the Xmn I polymorphism upstream of the Ggamma-globin gene. Southern blot analysis at the alpha-globin locus did not show any deletion that would account for the mildness of her phenotype. Therefore, homozygosity for the -29 mutation along with the Xmn I polymorphism appears to confer an extremely mild beta-thalassemia phenotype. This observation has important implications in the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of families segregating this type of genetic defect.",

We genotyped 370 subjects with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and 148 with postpolycythemia vera/postessential thrombocythemia (PPV/PET) MF for mutations of EZH2. Mutational status at diagnosis was correlated with hematologic parameters, clinical manifestations, and outcome. A total of 25 different EZH2 mutations were detected in 5.9% of PMF, 1.2% of PPV-MF, and 9.4% of PET-MF patients; most were exonic heterozygous missense changes. EZH2 mutation coexisted with JAK2V617F or ASXL1 mutation in 12 of 29 (41.4%) and 6 of 27 (22.2%) evaluated patients; TET2 and CBL mutations were found in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. EZH2-mutated PMF patients had significantly higher leukocyte counts, blast-cell counts, and larger spleens at diagnosis, and most of them (52.6%) were in the high-risk International Prognostic Score System (IPSS) category. After a median follow-up of 39 months, 128 patients (25.9%) died, 81 (63.3%) because of leukemia. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly reduced in EZH2-mutated PMF patients (P = .028 and P < .001, respectively); no such impact was seen for PPV/PET-MF patients, possibly due to the low number of mutated cases. In multivariate analysis, survival of PMF patients was predicted by IPSS high-risk category, a < 25% JAK2V617F allele burden, and EZH2 mutation status.

Many cancers overexpress ATF4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of ATF4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored. Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Strikingly, primary embryo fibroblasts from ATF4-deficient mice were resistant to transformation by coexpression of H-ras(V12) and SV40 large T antigen. In wild-type cells these oncogenes induced expression of the murine Atf4 gene along with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a, which encodes the cell senescence-associated proteins p16INK4 and p19ARF. Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation. Conversely, genetic ablation of ATF4 led to constitutive expression of p16INK4a and p19ARF, triggering cellular senescence. Our findings define a central function for ATF4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.",

BACKGROUND: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder of abnormal melanin formation, which results in hypopigmentation of skin, hair and eyes. OCA is classified into four types based on clinical and genetic findings. OCA1 is the most severe form of albinism, and is caused by mutations in the tyrosinase (TYR) gene, while OCA4 is caused due to mutations in SLC45A2. METHODS: In total, 13 families with > \u00a03 members with OCA were enrolled. Family history was ascertained and pedigrees were drawn up. Blood samples were collected and processed for DNA extraction. Linkage analysis was performed by typing three short tandem repeat markers in candidate regions of TYR and SLC45A2. Sequence analysis was performed of all the coding exons and adjacent intronic sequences of both genes. RESULTS: Eight families showed linkage to OCA1 and one family showed linkage to OCA4. Four missense substitutions (p.Arg239Trp, p.Ser192Tyr, p.Ser44Arg and p.Arg77Gln) were identified in TYR in the families with OCA1 linkage, and another missense substitution (p.Gln272Lys) was identified in the family with OCA4 linkage. One of the identified missense substitution (p.Arg77Gln) in TYR was found in five different families, which had a common haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: We identified four missense substitutions in TYR and a single missense substitution in SLC45A2. One missense substitution (p.Arg77Gln) in TYR was found in five different families that originated from the same geographical area and displayed a common haplotype, suggesting a single origin that then spread to different geographical areas of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan.",

BACKGROUND: Diphtheria toxin (DT) has shown anticancer activity in both experimental models and humans but its adverse effects stopped further developments. Cross-reacting Material 197 (CRM197) is the product of a single missense mutation (Gly52 to Glu) within fragment A of DT. It has been shown to induce weak toxicity in some cell strains, but it shares immunological properties with native DT. CRM197 commonly acts as an immunological adjuvant, or as an inhibitor of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor. Recently, CRM197 was shown to have promising antitumor activity. To better-define this property, we planned a phase I-II study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients bearing advanced melanoma (18 cases), and other solid tumors (two ovarian cancer, two sarcoma, two gastrointestinal cancers, one urinary bladder carcinoma, one glioblastoma, one neuroblastoma, one ocular melanoma and one primitive neuroectodermal embriogenic tumor (PNET) were evaluated and 19 of them, sub-divided in cohorts, received the following levels of CRM197: Level 1, 0.3 mg; level 2, 1.0 mg; level 3, 2.5 mg; level 4, 3.5 mg; level 5, 5.0 mg; level 6, 7.5 mg. The drug was given once every two days for 4 times and then, after a 2-week rest period, once every 2 days for 4 times. CRM197 was administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall. RESULTS: grade 1-2 common toxicities included fever, chills, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headache, neutrophilia and skin painful reactions appeared regularly at levels 3 and 4 (2.5 mg and 3.5 mg). Vomiting and abdominal pain, skin reaction tachycardia and hypotension appeared in two patients at level 5. At 7.5 mg, we observed a severe grade 3 reaction with hypotension, dyspnea and grade 4 myalgia. This was considered the dose-limiting toxicity. Eleven patients (seven with melanoma and four with other tumors) were treated to evaluate anticancer effects at the maximum tolerated dose (5 mg). Only one patient reported a minor response, lasting eight weeks. Ten patients reported progressive disease. CONCLUSION: CRM197, injected subcutaneously at 5 mg, elicited a generic inflammatory response causing toxicity, and did not exert a significant degree of antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma and solid tumour.",

Finally, we show that Yki acts synergistically with WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling to repress head determination by limiting the expression domains of posterior WNT genes and that of the WNT-inhibitor notum.

In this study, we first screened common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (minor allele frequency, MAF > 0.05) in Chinese population located in 481 UCEs sequences and selected seven SNPs (rs17049105, rs13020355, rs2682406, rs2056116, rs11190870, rs9572903, and rs8004379) of uc.51, uc.82, uc.133, uc.140, uc.302, uc.353, and uc.368, respectively.

Stage I with 735 cases and 735 controls was designed to discover the risk variants, followed by stage II with 762 cases and 762 controls to validate the significant variants.

No difference was observed for length of surgery, length of intubation, or ICU stay (p > .05). DEX patients perceived a shorter length of intubation (p = .044). A deeper sedation level was found in the propofol group (p = .021), with similar morphine and midazolam requirements (p = .317). Patient-rated level of overall awareness as a marker of amnesia did not differ between groups (p = .653). The ability to rest or sleep trended toward significance favoring propofol (p = .051). On evaluation of questionnaire ratings, DEX patients expressed more discomfort (p = .046), pain (p = .096), and sleeping difficulty (p = .036). Similar comfort levels were reported during extubation (p = .179). CONCLUSIONS: Despite theoretical advantages of DEX to improve overall patient satisfaction, the two agents provide similar responses to amnesia and pain control. According to our findings, DEX does not seem to have any advantage compared with propofol for short-term sedation after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",

Remarkable basic and translational advances have elucidated the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network in the pathogenesis of renal disease. Many of these advances originated from studies of the genetic disease tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), leading to one of the clearest therapeutic opportunities to target mTOR with rapamycin and its analogs (\"rapalogs\"), which effectively inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by an allosteric mechanism. Clinical trials based on these discoveries have provided strongly positive therapeutic results in TSC (Bissler JJ, McCormack FX, Young LR, Elwing JM, Chuck G, Leonard JM, Schmithorst VJ, Laor T, Brody AS, Bean J, Salisbury S, Franz DN.

TSC-associated renal disease, which affects >85% of TSC patients, and was a major topic of discussion, focused on angiomyolipomas and epithelial cysts. The third major topic was the role of mTOR and mTOR inhibition in the pathogenesis and therapy of chronic renal disease. Renal cell carcinoma, while recognized as a manifestation of TSC that occurs in a small fraction of patients, was not the primary focus of this workshop and thus was omitted from panel discussions and from this report.",

Glioblastoma is the most frequent and devastating primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Surgery followed by standard radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide is the standard of care in patients with glioblastoma, however the prognosis remains poor with a median survival in the range of 12-15 months. Common genetic abnormalities in glioblastoma are associated with aberrant activation or suppression of cellular signal transduction pathways and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Special attention has been focused on targets such as epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and on pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein-kinase pathways. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. This review summarizes the current results with cytotoxic and targeted molecular agents in glioblastoma and the development of new chemoradiation strategies under evaluation to increase their effectiveness.",

PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and administration of pertuzumab in patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer are reviewed. SUMMARY: Disease progression in HER2-positive breast cancer is often due to resistance to or a lack of efficacy of trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 therapy. Pertuzumab is the first humanized monoclonal antibody in a new class of drugs, the HER dimerization inhibitors, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Since pertuzumab binds to a different epitope than trastuzumab, combination therapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab results in a more complete blockade of HER2 signaling than trastuzumab monotherapy. The efficacy of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab-docetaxel dual therapy was demonstrated in a pivotal randomized multicenter Phase III trial, which showed a significant benefit in terms of progression-free survival, with improved overall survival, in favor of the triple therapy as an initial regimen in treatment-naive patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab has been found to have a tolerable toxicity profile. As clinical trials of pertuzumab for adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and metastatic-disease treatment continue, its role in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer will continue to evolve. CONCLUSION: Pertuzumab, a novel HER2 dimerization inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer when used in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel and is recommended for first-line therapy.",

Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer. Two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treatment of melanoma. Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.",

Recent studies have indicated that the proliferation of malignant gliomas is in part dependent on excessive activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated pathways. Conversely, inhibiting PKC may provide a novel approach for blocking glioma growth. The antiestrogen tamoxifen, a moderately potent PKC inhibitor, has been shown in vitro to block the proliferation of malignant glioma cell lines at concentrations several-fold higher than those typically attained during the treatment of breast cancer; such serum concentrations may be achieved with doses > 40 mg/m2 b.i.d. The safety and efficacy of these high doses for producing disease control in patients with malignant gliomas has recently been noted anecdotally, although a rigorous study of this agent has been lacking. To address this issue, we examined the safety and efficacy of high-dose tamoxifen in a series of children with malignant gliomas that had progressed after conventional therapy. An initial group was treated with 60 mg/m2 p.o. b.i.d. and a second group with 100 mg/m2 b.i.d. Steady-state serum tamoxifen and metabolite levels were measured in most patients. Toxicity with the regimen was minimal; two patients treated at the higher dose required reduction to the lower dose because of asymptomatic prolongation of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram. Although none of the patients exhibited clear-cut tumor regression, 4 of 14 patients had stabilization of previously progressive disease for at least 3 months; the longest survivor lived for 17 months after beginning tamoxifen. The moderate efficacy of this agent in otherwise end-stage disease coupled with its low toxicity and the relative ease of oral administration provides a rationale for proceeding with larger studies of this agent in patients with malignant gliomas, possibly as a means for potentiating the effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, which to date have shown limited efficacy in the treatment of these tumors.",

Primary microcephaly (PM) is a developmental disorder of early neuroprogenitors that results in reduction of the brain mass, particularly the cortex. To gain fresh insight into the pathogenesis of PM, we describe a consanguineous family with a novel genetic variant responsible for the disease. We performed autozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing to detect the causal genetic variant. Several functional assays in cells expressing the wild-type or mutant gene were performed to understand the pathogenesis of the identified mutation. We identify a novel mutation in PHC1, a human orthologue of the Drosophila polyhomeotic member of polycomb group (PcG), which significantly decreases PHC1 protein expression, increases Geminin protein level and markedly abolishes the capacity to ubiquitinate histone H2A in patient cells. PHC1 depletion in control cells similarly enhances Geminin expression and decreases histone H2A ubiquitination. The ubiquitination defect and accumulation of Geminin with consequent defect in cell cycle are rescued by over-expression of PHC1 in patient cells. Although patients with the PHC1 mutation exhibit PM with no overt progression of the disease, patient cells also show aberrant DNA damage repair, which is rescued by PHC1 overexpression. These findings reveal several cellular defects in cells carrying the PHC1 mutation and highlight the role of chromatin remodeling in the pathogenesis of PM.",

The way cells respond to DNA damage is important since inefficient repair or misrepair of lesions can have deleterious consequences, including mutation, genomic instability, neurodegenerative disorders, premature aging, cancer or death. Whether damage occurs spontaneously as a byproduct of normal metabolic processes, or after exposure to exogenous agents, cells muster a coordinated, complex DNA damage response (DDR) to mitigate potential harmful effects. A variety of activities are involved to promote cell survival, and include DNA repair, DNA damage tolerance, as well as transient cell cycle arrest to provide time for repair before entry into critical cell cycle phases, an event that could be lethal if traversal occurs while damage is present. When such damage is prolonged or not repairable, senescence, apoptosis or autophagy is induced. One major level of DDR regulation occurs via the orchestrated transcriptional control of select sets of genes encoding proteins that mediate the response. p53 is a transcription factor that transactivates specific DDR downstream genes through binding DNA consensus sequences usually in or near target gene promoter regions. The profile of p53-regulated genes activated at any given time varies, and is dependent upon type of DNA damage or stress experienced, exact composition of the consensus DNA binding sequence, presence of other DNA binding proteins, as well as cell context. RAD9 is another protein critical for the response of cells to DNA damage, and can also selectively regulate gene transcription. The limited studies addressing the role of RAD9 in transcription regulation indicate that the protein transactivates at least one of its target genes, p21/waf1/cip1, by binding to DNA sequences demonstrated to be a p53 response element. NEIL1 is also regulated by RAD9 through a similar DNA sequence, though not yet directly verified as a bonafide p53 response element. These findings suggest a novel pathway whereby p53 and RAD9 control the DDR through a shared mechanism involving an overlapping network of downstream target genes. Details and unresolved questions about how these proteins coordinate or compete to execute the DDR through transcriptional reprogramming, as well as biological implications, are discussed.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Temsirolimus 75 mg/m(2) was administered once weekly until disease progression or intolerance. Using the Simon 2-stage design, further enrolment in each disease cohort required > 2 objective responses within the first 12 weeks for the first 12 evaluable patients (those who received > 3 temsirolimus doses). RESULTS: Fifty-two heavily pretreated patients with relapsed (12%) or refractory (88%) disease, median age 8 years (range 1-21 years), were enroled and treated. One patient with neuroblastoma achieved confirmed partial response within the first 12 weeks; thus, none of the 3 cohorts met the criterion for continued enrolment. Disease stabilisation at week 12 was observed in 7 of 17 patients (41%) with high-grade glioma (5 diffuse pontine gliomas, 1 glioblastoma multiforme and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma), 6 of 19 (32%) with neuroblastoma and 1 of 16 (6%) with rhabdomyosarcoma (partial response confirmed at week 18).

BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation. Adults with uncontrolled persistent asthma who are receiving medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting \u03b22 agonist require additional treatment options as add-on therapy.

In the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL, the greatest increases (200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70008; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70063) in FEV1 compared with placebo were observed at week 12 with doses every 2 weeks in the 300 mg group (mean change 0\u00b739 L [SE 0\u00b705]; mean difference 0\u00b721 [95% CI 0\u00b706-0\u00b736; p=0\u00b70063]) and in the 200 mg group (mean change 0\u00b743 L [SE 0\u00b705]; mean difference 0\u00b726 [0\u00b711-0\u00b740; p=0\u00b70008]) compared with placebo (0\u00b718 L [SE 0\u00b705]). Similar significant increases were observed in the overall population and in the fewer than 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL subgroup (overall population: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p<0\u00b70001; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p<0\u00b70001; <300 eosinophils per \u03bcL: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70034; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70086), and were maintained to week 24. Likewise, dupilumab every 2 weeks produced the greatest reductions in annualised rates of exacerbation in the overall population (70-70\u00b75%), the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL (71\u00b72-80\u00b77%), and the subgroup with fewer than 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL (59\u00b79-67\u00b76%). The most common adverse events with dupilumab compared with placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (33-41% vs 35%) and injection-site reactions (13-26% vs 13%). INTERPRETATION: Dupilumab increased lung function and reduced severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma irrespective of baseline eosinophil count and had a favourable safety profile, and hence in addition to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting \u03b22-agonist therapy could improve the lives of patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma compared with standard therapy alone.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the risk of sudden death (SD) in both male and female athletes age 12 to 35 years. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk of SD in adolescents and young adults engaged in sports. METHODS: We did a 21-year prospective cohort study of all young people of the Veneto Region of Italy. From 1979 to 1999, the total population of adolescents and young adults averaged 1,386,600 (692,100 males and 694,500 females), of which 112,790 (90,690 males and 22,100 females) were competitive athletes. An analysis by gender of risk of SD and underlying pathologic substrates was performed in the athletic and non-athletic populations. RESULTS: There were 300 cases of SD, producing an overall cohort incidence rate of 1 in 100,000 persons per year. Fifty-five SDs occurred among athletes (2.3 in 100,000 per year) and 245 among non-athletes (0.9 in 100,000 per year), with an estimated relative risk (RR) of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 3.4; p < 0.0001). The RR of SD among athletes versus non-athletes was 1.95 (CI 1.3 to 2.6; p = 0.0001) for males and 2.00 (CI 0.6 to 4.9; p = 0.15) for females. The higher risk of SD in athletes was strongly related to underlying cardiovascular diseases such as congenital coronary artery anomaly (RR 79, CI 10 to 3,564; p < 0.0001), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (RR 5.4, CI 2.5 to 11.2; p < 0.0001), and premature coronary artery disease (RR 2.6, CI 1.2 to 5.1; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females. Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise.",

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic anemia with highly variable clinical symptoms making the diagnosis and prediction of its outcome difficult. It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. PNH is an outstanding example of how an increased understanding of pathophysiology may directly improve clinical symptoms and treat disease-associated complications when we inhibit the terminal complement cascade.

          "context": "Why just eat in, when you can also eat out? The current working definition of autophagy is the following: all processes in which intracellular material is degraded within the lysosome/vacuole and where the macromolecular constituents are recycled. There are several ways to classify the different types of autophagy. For example, we can separate autophagy into two primary types, based on the initial site of cargo sequestration. In particular, during microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, uptake occurs directly at the limiting membrane of the lysosome or vacuole. In contrast, macroautophagy-whether selective or nonselective-and endosomal microautophagy involve sequestration within an autophagosome or an omegasome, or late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, respectively; the key point being that in these types of autophagy the initial sequestration event does not occur at the limiting membrane of the degradative organelle. In any case, the cargo is ultimately delivered into the lysosome or vacuole lumen for subsequent degradation. Thus, I think most autophagy researchers view the degradative organelle as the ultimate destination of the pathway. Indeed, this fits with the general concept that organelles allow reactions to be compartmentalized. With regard to the lysosome or vacuole, this also confers a level of safety by keeping the lytic contents away from the remainder of the cell. If we are willing to slightly modify our definition of autophagy, with a focus on \"degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal/vacuolar machinery,\" we can include a newly documented process, programmed nuclear destruction (PND).",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and inflammatory genes have a role in the initiation and development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In our study, we examined the potential of using miRNA and inflammatory gene expression patterns as prognostic classifiers for ESCC. Five miRNAs and 25 inflammatory-related genes were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in tumor tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 178 Chinese patients with ESCC. The expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.027), miR-181b (p = 0.002) and miR-146b (p = 0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p = 0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with overall survival of patients. These data were combined to generate a miRNA risk score that was significantly associated with worse prognosis (p = 0.0001), suggesting that these miRNAs may be useful prognostic classifiers for ESCC. To construct an inflammatory gene prognostic classifier, we divided the population into training (n = 124) and test cohorts (n = 54). The expression levels of CRY61, CTGF and IL-18 in tumor tissue and VEGF in adjacent noncancerous tissue were modestly associated with prognosis in the training cohort |Z-score| > 1.5 and were subsequently used to construct a Cox regression-based inflammatory risk score (IRS). IRS was significantly associated with survival in both the training cohort (p = 0.002) and the test cohort (p = 0.005). Furthermore, Cox regression models combining both miRNA risk score and IRS performed significantly better than models with either alone (p < 0.001 likelihood ratio test). Therefore, miRNA and inflammatory gene expression patterns, alone or in combination, have potential as prognostic classifiers for ESCC and may help to guide therapeutic decisions.",

Recent studies indicate that long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) are mobilized in the genome of human neural progenitor cells and enhanced in Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia. However, whether aberrant L1 retrotransposition occurs in mental disorders is unknown. Here, we report high L1 copy number in schizophrenia. Increased L1 was demonstrated in neurons from prefrontal cortex of patients and in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neurons containing 22q11 deletions. Whole-genome sequencing revealed brain-specific L1 insertion in patients localized preferentially to synapse- and schizophrenia-related genes. To study the mechanism of L1 transposition, we examined perinatal environmental risk factors for schizophrenia in animal models and observed an increased L1 copy number after immune activation by poly-I:C or epidermal growth factor. These findings suggest that hyperactive retrotransposition of L1 in neurons triggered by environmental and/or genetic risk factors may contribute to the susceptibility and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",

RGS proteins are defined by the presence of a semiconserved RGS domain that confers the GTPase-activating activity of these proteins toward certain G alpha subunits. RGS6 is a member of a subfamily of RGS proteins distinguished by the presence of DEP and GGL domains, the latter a G beta 5-interacting domain. Here we report identification of 36 distinct transcripts of human RGS6 that arise by unusually complex processing of the RGS6 gene, which spans 630 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA in human chromosome 14 and is interrupted by 19 introns. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. The role of structural diversity in the N-terminal and GGL domains of RGS6 splice variants in their interaction with G beta 5 and subcellular localization and of G beta 5 on RGS6 protein localization was examined in COS-7 cells expressing various RGS6 splice variant proteins. RGS6 splice variants with complete GGL domains interacted with G beta 5, irrespective of the type of N-terminal domain, while those lacking a complete GGL domain did not. RGS6 protein variants displayed subcellular distribution patterns ranging from an exclusive cytoplasmic to exclusive nuclear/nucleolar localization, and co-expression of G beta 5 promoted nuclear localization of RGS6 proteins. Analysis of our results show that the long N-terminal and GGL domain sequences of RGS6 proteins function as cytoplasmic retention sequences to prevent their nuclear/nucleolar accumulation. These findings provide the first evidence for G beta 5-independent functions of the GGL domain and for a role of G beta 5 in RGS protein localization. This study reveals extraordinary complexity in processing of the human RGS6 gene and provides new insights into how structural diversity in the RGS6 protein family is involved in their localization and likely function(s) in cells.",

It is useful for physicians or dermatologists managing psoriasis patients to be aware of how to concurrently manage the joint manifestations, as it is preferable and convenient to use a single agent in such patients. However, only certain therapies are effective for both. Systemic agents, which can be used for both skin and joint manifestations, include methotrexate and ciclosporin. For the group of biologic agents, the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors such as adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, golimumab and certolizumab are effective. Ustekinumab is a more recently developed agent belonging to the group of anti-IL-12p40 antibodies and has been shown to be efficacious. Newer drugs in the treatment armamentarium that have shown efficacy for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis consist of the anti-IL-17 agent, secukinumab, and a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, apremilast. The other anti-IL-17 agents, ixekizumab and brodalumab, as well as the oral Jak inhibitor, tofacitinib, have very limited but promising data.

Purpose: The zonule of Zinn (ciliary zonule) is a system of fibers that centers the crystalline lens on the optical axis of the eye. Mutations in zonule components underlie syndromic conditions associated with a broad range of ocular pathologies, including microspherophakia and ectopia lentis. Here, we used HPLC-mass spectrometry to determine the molecular composition of the zonule. Methods: Tryptic digests of human and bovine zonular samples were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. The distribution of selected components was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In bovine samples, the composition of the equatorial zonule was compared to that of the hyaloid zonule and vitreous humor. Results: The 52 proteins common to the zonules of both species accounted for >95% of the zonular protein. Glycoproteins constituted the main structural components, with two proteins, FBN1 and LTBP2, constituting 70%-80% of the protein. Other abundant components were MFAP2, EMILIN-1, and ADAMTSL-6. Lysyl oxidase-like 1, a crosslinking enzyme implicated in collagen and elastin biogenesis, was detected at significant levels. The equatorial and hyaloid zonular samples were compositionally similar to each other, although the hyaloid sample was relatively enriched in the proteoglycan opticin and the fibrillar collagens COL2A1, COL11A1, COL5A2, and COL5A3. Conclusions: The zonular proteome was surprisingly complex. In addition to structural components, it contained signaling proteins, protease inhibitors, and crosslinking enzymes. The equatorial and hyaloid zonules were similar in composition, but the latter may form part of a composite structure, the hyaloid membrane, that stabilizes the vitreous face.",

MicroRNA, an endogenous noncoding RNA modulating gene expression, is a key molecule that by its dysregulation plays roles in inflammatory-driven carcinogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the role of oncomiR miR-21 and its target, the programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) in tumor growth and metastasis of the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The expression levels of miR-21 and PDCD4 were analyzed using the TaqMan miRNA expression assay and immunohistochemistry in liver tissues of both O. viverrini plus N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)-treated hamsters and human CCA samples (n=23 cases). The functional assay for miR-21 was performed in CCA cell lines by the anti-miR-21 and pre-miR-21 transfection procedures. The peak of miR-21 levels were reached at 2 (hyperplastic lesions) and 6 (CCA) months of the O. viverrini plus NDMA-induced group and had a reverse response with its target PDCD4 proteins. In human CCA, miR-21 was overexpressed in tumor tissues when compared with nontumor tissues (P=0.0034) and had a negative correlation with PDCD4 protein (P=0.026). It was also found that high expression of miR-21 was significantly correlated with shorter survival (P<0.05) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.037) of CCA patients. Transient transfection of pre-miR-21 reduced the PDCD4 level and resulted in an increase of M213 CCA cell growth and wound-induced migration ability. These results indicated that miR-21 plays a role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of O. viverrini-associated CCA by suppressing the function of PDCD4.

The release of Ca from the SR may be regulated by the ryanodine receptor, triadin, junctin, calsequestrin, and a histidine-rich, Ca-binding protein (HRC). We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure. To gain insight into the physiological function of HRC, we infected adult rat cardiac myocytes with a recombinant adenovirus that contains the full-length mouse HRC cDNA. Overexpression (1.7-fold) of HRC in adult rat cardiomyocytes was associated with increased SR Ca load (28%) but decreased SR Ca-induced Ca release (37%), resulting in impaired Ca cycling and depressed fractional shortening (36%) as well as depressed rates of shortening (38%) and relengthening (33%). Furthermore, the depressed basal contractile and Ca kinetic parameters in the HRC-infected myocytes remained significantly depressed even after maximal isoproterenol stimulation. Interestingly, HRC overexpresssion was accompanied by increased protein levels of junctin (1.4-fold) and triadin (1.8-fold), whereas the protein levels of ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, phospholamban, and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase remained unaltered.

We applied this strategy to microarray-based gene expression profiles from 79 human tissues and identified 7187 candidate enhancers that defined their flanking gene expression, the majority of which were located outside of known promoters.

We used the sequence signatures identified by this approach to successfully assign tissue-specific predictions to approximately 328,000 human-mouse conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. By overlapping these genome-wide predictions with a data set of enhancers validated in vivo, in transgenic mice, we were able to confirm our results with a 28% sensitivity and 50% precision. These results indicate the power of combining complementary genomic data sets as an initial computational foray into a global view of tissue-specific gene regulation in vertebrates.",

          "context": "The commensal microbiota exacerbate infectious colitis in stressor-exposed mice. Exposure to a prolonged restraint stressor disrupts the colonic microbiota community composition, and is associated with an elevated inflammatory response to colonic pathogen challenge. Since the stability of the microbiota has been implicated in the development and modulation of mucosal immune responses, we hypothesized that the disruptive effect of the stressor upon the microbiota composition directly contributed to the stressor-induced exacerbation of pathogen-induced colitis. In order to establish a causative role for stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, conventional mice were exposed to prolonged restraint to change the microbiota. Germfree mice were then colonized by microbiota from either stressor-exposed or non-stressed control mice. One day after colonization, mice were infected with the colonic pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. At six days post-infection, mice that received microbiota from stressor-exposed animals had significant increases in colonic pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine (e.g. IL-1\u03b2) and chemokine (e.g. CCL2) levels after C. rodentium infection in comparison with mice that received microbiota from non-stressed mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that microbial communities from stressed mice did not have any detectable Bifidobacterium present, a stark contrast with the microbial communities from non-stressed mice, suggesting that stressor-induced alterations in commensal, immunomodulatory Bifidobacterium levels may predispose to an increased inflammatory response to pathogen challenge. This study demonstrates that the commensal microbiota directly contribute to excessive inflammatory responses to C. rodentium during stressor exposure, and may help to explain why gastrointestinal disorders are worsened during stressful experiences.",

Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a severe intellectual disability (ID)-distinctive facial gestalt-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, commonly associating microcephaly, epilepsy, corpus callosum agenesis, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital malformations and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations lead to haplo-insufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of which resides in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. Patients' phenotype included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, heart defects or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all the three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Taking advantage of the zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent, embryo rescue, correlating with the severity of patients' phenotype, was observed. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.",

          "context": "\"Autophagy suite\": Atg9 cycling in the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway. Macroautophagy continues to gather increasing attention because it is connected with a wide range of human pathophysiologies, developmental processes and life span extension. It is also an interesting process from a basic cellular biology standpoint, as it involves dynamic membrane rearrangements and multiple protein-protein interactions. Although macroautophagy can be nonspecific, there are many examples of selective sequestration including pexophagy, mitophagy and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. At present, the Cvt pathway is unique in that it is the only example of a biosynthetic use of macroautophagy. Most of the autophagy-related (Atg) proteins are involved in the Cvt pathway, and various types of analyses have placed these proteins at particular stages of the process. For example, Atg9 is the only characterized transmembrane protein that is absolutely required for Cvt vesicle formation, and it is proposed to carry membrane from peripheral donor sites to the phagophore assembly site where the vesicle forms. Additional proteins, including Atg11, Atg23 and Atg27 are involved in this anterograde movement, whereas Atg1-Atg13 and Atg2-Atg18 are required for the retrograde return to the peripheral sites. Even when we illustrate our understanding of these events in a schematic model, however, they are by necessity flat two-dimensional representations, lacking movement and sound. Yet the cell is a living entity that is not well served by this sole method of information display. Accordingly, we decided to present the Cvt pathway as a vibrant, dynamic process by combining science, music and illustration.",

Modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. Receptor knockout (KO) mice offer an opportunity to identify receptors that contribute to a drug-induced effect. Here we examined the effects of modafinil on exploration in C57BL/6J mice, in dopamine drd1, drd2, drd3, and drd4 wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and KO mice, and in 129/SJ mice pretreated with the drd1 antagonist SCH23390 using a cross-species test paradigm based on the behavioral pattern monitor. Modafinil increased activity, specific exploration (rearing), and the smoothness of locomotor paths (reduced spatial d) in C57BL/6J and 129/SJ mice (increased holepoking was also observed in these mice). These behavioral profiles are similar to that produced by the dopamine transporter inhibitor GBR12909. Modafinil was ineffective at increasing activity in male drd1 KOs, rearing in female drd1 KOs, or reducing spatial d in all drd1 KOs, but produced similar effects in drd1 WT and HT mice as in C57BL/6J mice. Neither dopamine drd2 nor drd3 mutants attenuated modafinil-induced effects. Drd4 mutants exhibited a genotype dose-dependent attenuation of modafinil-induced increases in specific exploration. Furthermore, the drd1 KO effects were largely supported by the SCH23390 study. Thus, the dopamine drd1 receptor appears to exert a primary role in modafinil-induced effects on spontaneous exploration, whereas the dopamine drd4 receptor appears to be important for specific exploration. The modafinil-induced alterations in exploratory behavior may reflect increased synaptic dopamine and secondary actions mediated by dopamine drd1 and drd4 receptors.",

The syndromes of Sotos and Weaver are paradigmatic of the daily nosologic difficulties faced by clinical geneticists attempting to diagnose and counsel, and to give accurate prognoses in cases of extensive phenotypic overlap between molecularly undefined entities. Vertebrate development is constrained into only very few final or common developmental paths; therefore, no developmental anomaly seen in humans is unique to (\"pathognomonic\" of) one syndrome. Thus, it is not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes, including the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Are they sufficiently different in other respects to allow the postulation of locus (rather than allele) heterogeneity? Phenotypic data in both conditions are biased because of ascertainment of propositi, and the apparent differences between them may be entirely artificial as they were between the G and BBB syndromes. On the other hand, the Sotos syndrome may be a cancer syndrome, the Weaver syndrome not (though a neuroblastoma was reported in the latter); in the former there is also remarkably advanced dental maturation rarely commented on in the latter. In Weaver syndrome there are more conspicuous contractures and a facial appearance that experts find convincingly different from that of Sotos individuals. Nevertheless, the hypothesis of locus heterogeneity is testable; at the moment we are inclined to favor the hypothesis of allele heterogeneity. An international effort is required to map, isolate, and sequence the causal gene or genes.",

In osteoclasts, Src controls podosome organization and bone degradation, which leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype in src(-/-) mice. Since this phenotype was even more severe in src(-/-)hck(-/-) mice, we examined the individual contribution of Hck in bone homeostasis. Compared to wt mice, hck(-/-) mice exhibited an osteopetrotic phenotype characterized by an increased density of trabecular bone and decreased bone degradation, although osteoclastogenesis was not impaired. Podosome organization and matrix degradation were found to be defective in hck(-/-) osteoclast precursors (preosteoclast) but were normal in mature hck(-/-) osteoclasts, probably through compensation by Src, which was specifically overexpressed in mature osteoclasts. As a consequence of podosome defects, the 3-dimensional migration of hck(-/-) preosteoclasts was strongly affected in vitro. In vivo, this translated by altered bone homing of preosteoclasts in hck(-/-) mice: in metatarsals of 1-wk-old mice, when bone formation strongly depends on the recruitment of these cells, reduced numbers of osteoclasts and abnormal developing trabecular bone were observed. This phenotype was still detectable in adults. In summmary, Hck is one of the very few effectors of preosteoclast recruitment described to date and thereby plays a critical role in bone remodeling.",
