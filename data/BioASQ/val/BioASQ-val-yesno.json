Plasmepsins, a family of aspartic proteases of Plasmodium species, are known to participate in a wide variety of cellular processes essential for parasite survival. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. Although the plasmepsins of P. falciparum have been extensively characterized, the plasmepsins of P. vivax are currently not well known. To expand our understanding of the plasmepsins of P. vivax, we characterized plasmepsin 4 of P. vivax (PvPM4). The bacterially expressed recombinant PvPM4 was insoluble, but it was easily refolded into a soluble protein. The processing of PvPM4 into a mature enzyme occurred through autocatalytic activity under acidic conditions in a pepstatin A-sensitive manner, in which process a portion of prodomain was essential for correct folding. PvPM4 could hydrolyze native human hemoglobin at acidic pHs, but preferred denatured hemoglobin as a substrate. PvPM4 acted synergistically with vivapain-2 and vivapain-3, cysteine proteases of P. vivax, in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin. The vivapains also mediated processing of PvPM4 into a mature enzyme. These results collectively suggest that PvPM4 is an active hemoglobinase of P. vivax that works collaboratively with vivapains to enhance the parasite's ability to hydrolyze hemoglobin.",

Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in males and is second only to lung cancer. Although effective surgical and radiation treatments exist for clinically localized prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer remains essentially incurable. Here we show, through gene expression profiling, that the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is overexpressed in hormone-refractory, metastatic prostate cancer. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeted against EZH2 reduce the amounts of EZH2 protein present in prostate cells and also inhibit cell proliferation in vitro. Ectopic expression of EZH2 in prostate cells induces transcriptional repression of a specific cohort of genes. Gene silencing mediated by EZH2 requires the SET domain and is attenuated by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression.",

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the neurological prognosis and development of vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). METHODS: Eighty-two adult patients with aSAH diagnoses were prospectively evaluated. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, cranial CT scans, digital subtraction angiography studies and daily neurological examinations were recorded. Serial serum CRP measurements were obtained daily between admission and the tenth day. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were used to assess the prognosis. RESULTS: Serum CRP levels were related to severity of aSAH. Patients with lower GCS scores and higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades presented statistically significant higher serum CRP levels. Patients with higher serum CRP levels had a less favorable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum CRP levels were strongly associated with worse clinical prognosis in this study.",

Molecular analysis of the PDS gene was performed in two consanguineous large families from Southern Tunisia comprising a total of 23 individuals affected with profound congenital deafness; the same missense mutation, L445W, was identified in all affected individuals.

AIM: Some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. These may be important risk factors for cardio and cerebrovascular diseases. We investigated whether the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia and increase the risk factor for stroke. METHODS: A total of 203 acute stroke patients and 55 controls were recruited. Polymorphisms were determined by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and plasma total homocysteine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between C677T and A1298C genotypes and allele frequencies in the stroke patients and controls. Total plasma homocysteine level was higher in the 677TT and 1298AA genotypes in stroke patients and especially small-vessel disease patient subgroup. Age, number of males, systolic-diastolic blood pressures, creatinine, vitamin B(12) and homocysteine levels were significantly high among stroke patients. Age, sex, systolic blood pressure and HDL-C were determined as risk factors for homocysteine levels. We also determined that the effect of A1298C polymorphism on homocysteine was not as high as that of C677T polymorphism in acute stroke patients. We conclude that the MTHFR genotype may be a modest risk factor for stroke in Turkish population.",

However, only rarely do tumors regress completely, and the therapeutic effects are often temporary. Several mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibitors have been proposed. The majority of these cause ERK signaling to become insensitive to treatment with RAF inhibitors by increasing the amount of RAF dimers in cells, whereas others bypass the dependence of the tumor on mutant RAF. One motivation for studying mechanisms of drug resistance is that such efforts may suggest new therapeutic targets or rational combination strategies that delay or prevent the emergence of drug-resistant clones. Here, we review the current model of RAF inhibitor resistance with a focus on the implications of this model on ongoing laboratory and clinical efforts to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for patients with BRAF-mutant tumors.",

BACKGROUND: A GC-compositional strand bias or GC-skew (=(C-G)/(C+G)), where C and G denote the numbers of cytosine and guanine residues, was recently reported near the transcription start sites (TSS) of Arabidopsis genes. However, it is unclear whether other eukaryotic species have equally prominent GC-skews, and the biological meaning of this trait remains unknown. RESULTS: Our study confirmed a significant GC-skew (C > G) in the TSS of Oryza sativa (rice) genes. The full-length cDNAs and genomic sequences from Arabidopsis and rice were compared using statistical analyses. Despite marked differences in the G+C content around the TSS in the two plants, the degrees of bias were almost identical. Although slight GC-skew peaks, including opposite skews (C < G), were detected around the TSS of genes in human and Drosophila, they were qualitatively and quantitatively different from those identified in plants. However, plant-like GC-skew in regions upstream of the translation initiation sites (TIS) in some fungi was identified following analyses of the expressed sequence tags and/or genomic sequences from other species. On the basis of our dataset, we estimated that > 70 and 68% of Arabidopsis and rice genes, respectively, had a strong GC-skew (> 0.33) in a 100-bp window (that is, the number of C residues was more than double the number of G residues in a +/-100-bp window around the TSS). The mean GC-skew value in the TSS of highly-expressed genes in Arabidopsis was significantly greater than that of genes with low expression levels. Many of the GC-skew peaks were preferentially located near the TSS, so we examined the potential value of GC-skew as an index for TSS identification. Our results confirm that the GC-skew can be used to assist the TSS prediction in plant genomes. CONCLUSION: The GC-skew (C > G) around the TSS is strictly conserved between monocot and eudicot plants (ie. angiosperms in general), and a similar skew has been observed in some fungi. Highly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genes.",

We have carried out a computational study on 725 bacterial genomes, aiming to elucidate other factors that may have influenced the strand location of genes in a bacterium. Our analyses suggest that (i) genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands; (ii) genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands; (iii) there is a balancing force that tends to keep genes from all moving to the leading and more efficient strand and (iv) the percentage of leading-strand genes in an bacterium can be accurately explained based on the numbers of genes in the functional categories outlined in (i) and (ii), genome size and gene density, indicating that these numbers implicitly contain the information about the percentage of genes on the leading versus lagging strand in a genome.",

To investigate the expression profile of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to UVA and UVB we employed a reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach using degenerate primers derived from the conserved catalytic domain of PTKs. Quantitative real-time PCR with specific primers was used to confirm the influence of UV on the expression of the identified PTKs. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. UVB was followed by an initial downregulation and a subsequent increase in Arg mRNA reaching five-fold baseline levels after 24 h. We conclude that UVA and UVB differentially modify the expression of PTKs in NHEK, and that Arg appears to have a major role in the response of keratinocytes to UV.

The integrity of the feto-maternal interface is critical for survival of the conceptus. This interface, consisting of the maternal decidua and the invading placental trophoblast, is exposed to profound changes in oxygen tension during pregnancy. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling. This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase. However, silencing of FOXO1 did not increase the susceptibility of decidualized cells to oxidative cell death. Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells. Expression of a constitutively active FOXO3a mutant elicited apoptosis in decidualized cells. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous FOXO3a in undifferentiated cells abrogated apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death. The differential regulation of FOXO expression provides the decidua with a robust system capable of coping with prolonged episodes of oxidative stress during pregnancy.",

However, why are there still lagging strand encoded genes? Paul et al. recently proposed that these genes take advantage of the increased mutagenesis resulting from head-on collisions and are thus adaptively encoded on the lagging strand.

Stable disease > 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Grade > 3 AEs were reported for 54% of patients; anemia was the most common (17%). CONCLUSION: Responses to olaparib were observed across different tumor types associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Olaparib warrants further investigation in confirmatory studies.",

Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways.",

Mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS), a DNA/RNA binding protein, have been associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscular weakness and has overlapping clinical and pathologic characteristics with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. However, the role of autophagy in regulation of FUS-positive stress granules (SGs) and aggregates remains unclear. We found that the ALS-linked FUS(R521C) mutation causes accumulation of FUS-positive SGs under oxidative stress, leading to a disruption in the release of FUS from SGs in cultured neurons. Autophagy controls the quality of proteins or organelles; therefore, we checked whether autophagy regulates FUS(R521C)-positive SGs. Interestingly, FUS(R521C)-positive SGs were colocalized to RFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes. Furthermore, FUS-positive SGs accumulated in atg5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in autophagy-deficient neurons. However, FUS(R521C) expression did not significantly impair autophagic degradation. Moreover, autophagy activation with rapamycin reduced the accumulation of FUS-positive SGs in an autophagy-dependent manner. Rapamycin further reduced neurite fragmentation and cell death in neurons expressing mutant FUS under oxidative stress. Overall, we provide a novel pathogenic mechanism of ALS associated with a FUS mutation under oxidative stress, as well as therapeutic insight regarding FUS pathology associated with excessive SGs.",

This frequently occurs as a new mutation, manifesting one of the highest documented rates for any transversion in the human genome. To understand the biology of this mutation, we have investigated its parental origin, and the ages of the parents, in 19 families with de novo c.749C>G mutations. All ten informative cases originated from the paternal allele (95% confidence interval 74-100% paternal); the average paternal age at birth overall was 34.7 years. An exclusive paternal origin of mutations, and increased paternal age, were previously described for a different mutation (c.1138G>A) of the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasia, as well as for mutations of the related FGFR2 gene causing Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes.

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study. SETTING: Cardiac operating room at a single institution. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either 20 \u03bcg of oral T3 or placebo every 12 hours starting 20 minutes before anesthetic induction, for a total of 4 doses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones were measured serially before surgery, upon arrival in the intensive care unit, and 12, 24, and 36 hours after surgery. Hemodynamic variables also were recorded serially. Postoperative inotrope requirement and major morbidity endpoints were assessed. Serum T3 concentrations were significantly higher with fewer patients having T3 concentrations below the normal range in the T3 group than the placebo group throughout the postoperative period. Hemodynamic variables, postoperative inotrope requirement, and outcome variables showed no differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral T3 therapy significantly attenuated the postoperative decline in T3 concentrations in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

The Parapoxvirus Orf virus represents a promising candidate for novel vector vaccines due to its immune modulating properties even in nonpermissive hosts such as mouse or rat. The highly attenuated Orf virus strain D1701 was used to generate a recombinant virus (D1701-VrVp40) expressing nucleoprotein p40 of Borna disease virus, which represents a major antigen for the induction of a Borna disease virus-specific humoral and cellular immune response. Infection with Borna disease virus leads to distinct neurological symptoms mediated by the invasion of activated specific CD8+ T cells into the infected brain. Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. In the present study we show for the first time that intramuscular application of the D1701-VrVp40 recombinant protected rats against Borna disease, and importantly, virus clearance from the infected brain was demonstrated in immunized animals. Even 4 and 8 months after the last immunization, all immunized animals were still protected against the disease. Initial characterization of the immune cells attracted to the infected brain areas suggested that D1701-VrVp40 mediated induction of B cells and antibody-producing plasma cells as well as T cells. These findings suggest the induction of various defense mechanisms against Borna disease virus. First studies on the role of antiviral cytokines indicated that D1701-VrVp40 immunization did not lead to an enhanced early response of gamma or alpha interferon or tumor necrosis factor alpha. Collectively, this study describes the potential of the Orf virus vector system in mediating long-lasting, protective antiviral immunity and eliminating this persistent virus infection without provoking massive neuronal damage.",

We have shown that the cellular process of macroautophagy plays a protective role in HL-1 cardiomyocytes subjected to simulated ischemia/reperfusion (sI/R) (Hamacher-Brady et al. in J Biol Chem 281(40):29776-29787). Since the nucleoside adenosine has been shown to mimic both early and late phase ischemic preconditioning, a potent cardioprotective phenomenon, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of adenosine on autophagosome formation. Autophagy is a highly regulated intracellular degradation process by which cells remove cytosolic long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, and can be monitored by imaging the incorporation of microtubule-associated light chain 3 (LC3) fused to a fluorescent protein (GFP or mCherry) into nascent autophagosomes. We investigated the effect of adenosine receptor agonists on autophagy and cell survival following sI/R in GFP-LC3 infected HL-1 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The A(1) adenosine receptor agonist 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) (100 nM) caused an increase in the number of autophagosomes within 10 min of treatment; the effect persisted for at least 300 min. A significant inhibition of autophagy and loss of protection against sI/R measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), was demonstrated in CCPA-pretreated cells treated with an A(1) receptor antagonist, a phospholipase C inhibitor, or an intracellular Ca(+2) chelator. To determine whether autophagy was required for the protective effect of CCPA, autophagy was blocked with a dominant negative inhibitor (Atg5(K130R)) delivered by transient transfection (in HL-1 cells) or protein transduction (in adult rat cardiomyocytes). CCPA attenuated LDH release after sI/R, but protection was lost when autophagy was blocked. To assess autophagy in vivo, transgenic mice expressing the red fluorescent autophagy marker mCherry-LC3 under the control of the alpha myosin heavy chain promoter were treated with CCPA 1 mg/kg i.p. Fluorescence microscopy of cryosections taken from the left ventricle 30 min after CCPA injection revealed a large increase in the number of mCherry-LC3-labeled structures, indicating the induction of autophagy by CCPA in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that autophagy plays an important role in mediating the cardioprotective effects conferred by adenosine pretreatment.",

BAG3 was recently described as a mediator of a novel macroautophagy pathway that uses the specificity of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to misfolded proteins and also involves other protein partners, such as HSPB8. Also crucial for induction and execution of autophagy are sequestosome-1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) and LC3, an autophagosome-associated protein. In this novel pathway, BAG3 mediates the targeting and transport of degradation-prone substrates into aggresomes via the microtubule-motor dynein.

Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a bone-marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Majority of the 15 FA genes and encoded proteins characterized so far are integrated into DNA repair pathways, however, other important functions cannot be excluded. FA cells are sensitive to oxidants, and accumulation of oxidized proteins has been characterized for several FA subgroups. Clinical phenotypes of both FA and other closely related diseases suggest altered functions of mitochondria, organelles responsible for cellular energetic metabolism, and also serving as an important producer and the most susceptible target from reactive oxidative species (ROS). In this study, we have shown that elevated level of mitochondrial ROS in FA cells is in parallel with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, the decrease of ATP production, impaired oxygen uptake and pathological changes in the morphology of mitochondria. This is accompanied by inactivation of enzymes that are essential for the energy production (F1F0ATPase and cytochrome C oxidase) and detoxification of ROS (superoxide dismutase, SOD1). In turn, overexpression of SOD1 could rescue oxygen consumption rate in FA-deficient cells. Importantly, the depletion of mitochondria improved survival rate of mitomycin C treated FA cells suggesting that hypersensitivity of FA cells to chemotherapeutic drugs could be in part due to the mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress. On the basis of our results, we propose that deficiency in FA genes lead to disabling mitochondrial ROS-scavenging machinery further affecting mitochondrial functions and suppressing cell respiration.",

OBJECTIVE Functional Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) procedures have been increasingly used for treating patients with tremor, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although its rates of toxicity are low, GKRS has been associated with some, if low, risks for serious sequelae, including hemiparesis and even death. Anecdotal reports have suggested that even with a standardized prescription dose, rates of functional GKRS toxicity increase after replacement of an old cobalt-60 source with a new source. Dose rate changes over the course of the useful lifespan of cobalt-60 are not routinely considered in the study of patients treated with functional GKRS, but these changes may be associated with significant variation in the biologically effective dose (BED) delivered to neural tissue. METHODS The authors constructed a linear-quadratic model of BED in functional GKRS with a dose-protraction factor to correct for intrafraction DNA-damage repair and used standard single-fraction doses for trigeminal nerve ablation for TN (85 Gy), thalamotomy for tremor (130 Gy), and capsulotomy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (180 Gy). Dose rate and treatment time for functional GKRS involving 4-mm collimators were derived from calibrations in the authors' department and from the cobalt-60 decay rate. Biologically plausible values for the ratio for radiosensitivity to fraction size (\u03b1/\u03b2) and double-strand break (DSB) DNA repair halftimes (\u03c4) were estimated from published experimental data. The biphasic characteristics of DSB repair in normal tissue were accounted for in deriving an effective \u03c4 halftime (fast repair) and \u03c4 halftime (slow repair). A sensitivity analysis was performed with a range of plausible parameter values. RESULTS After replacement of the cobalt-60 source, the functional GKRS dose rate rose from 1.48 to 2.99 Gy/min, treatment time fell, and estimated BED increased. Assuming the most biologically plausible parameters, source replacement resulted in an immediate relative BED increase of 11.7% for GKRS-based TN management with 85 Gy, 15.6% for thalamotomy with 130 Gy, and 18.6% for capsulotomy with 180 Gy. Over the course of the 63-month lifespan of the cobalt-60 source, BED decreased annually by 2.2% for TN management, 3.0% for thalamotomy, and 3.5% for capsulotomy. CONCLUSIONS Use of a new cobalt-60 source after replacement of an old source substantially increases the predicted BED for functional GKRS treatments for the same physical dose prescription. Source age, dose rate, and treatment time should be considered in the study of outcomes after high-dose functional GKRS treatments. Animal and clinical studies are needed to determine how this potential change in BED contributes to GKRS toxicity and whether technical adjustments should be made to reduce dose rates or prescription doses with newer cobalt-60 sources.",

BACKGROUND: Increased rates of depression are reported in coronary artery disease (CAD). In heart disease, depression increases disability, reduces quality of life, and increases mortality. HYPOTHESIS: The study was undertaken to examine the relationship between depression and thyroid axis function in patients with CAD. METHODS: In all, 73 patients with CAD, consecutively admitted to a cardiac rehabilitation hospital, were assessed for depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Blood was drawn for assessment of thyroid axis hormones and the N-amino terminal fragment of the pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). RESULTS: The patients with CAD with depressive symptoms had a higher prevalence of cardiac failure (p = 0.04), higher NT-pro BNP concentrations (p = 0.02), and lower free triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations (p = 0.04) than patients with CAD but without depressive symptoms. They also showed a strong trend (p = 0.058) toward a higher incidence of the low T3 syndrome. Higher NT-pro BNP concentrations were related to lower total T3 concentrations (r = -0.294, p = 0.011) and to higher reverse T3 concentrations (r = 0.353, p = 0.002). In men, higher scores of depression were related to lower total T3 concentration (r = -0.289, p = 0.034) and to higher NT-pro BNP concentration (r = 0.380, p = 0.005).

The natural history of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is characterized by a high probability of recurrence and in the case of high-grade tumors, progression to muscle invasive cancer. This mandates a follow-up strategy designed to identify recurrences in the bladder early in their evolution in order to facilitate early intervention and ablation. Urine cytology is considered the gold standard urine biomarker. Although specificity exceeds 90% to 95%, its overall sensitivity ranges from 40% to 60% in expert hands and is both tumor grade and operator dependent. While cytology is an excellent test for detection of high-grade disease, the sensitivity is particularly weak for the detection of low grade tumors. This has spawned an entire field of research of in vitro diagnostic tests and cell-based assays in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy for detection of incident or recurrent disease. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration approved dipstick and immunoassays marketed as point-of-care tests. The point-of-care tests are intended for use as an adjunct to cystoscopy and cytology, and may have a role in the office evaluation of hematuria patients. Monoclonal antibody-based tests combined with cytology may improve the diagnostic accuracy and are superior to cytology alone. A recently approved cell-based assay, utilizing fluorescent in situ hybridization technology, may help resolve suspicious cytologies, and provide early and additional information about the biology of the bladder urothelium beyond that provided by cytology, a marker of disease relatively late in evolution.

Herein we investigated frequency and penetrance of the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat pathological expansion in a large cohort of familial and sporadic FTLD and related disorders (FTLD and related disorders, n = 388; Controls, n = 201).

In our cohort, the C9ORF72 pathological expansion: (i) showed a prevalence of 7.5%; (ii) showed a full penetrance by the age of 80; (iii) was rarely found in sporadic patients; (iv) was solely associated with FTLD; (v) was mainly associated with bvFTD clinical subtype; and (vi) was associated with earlier age of onset in the youngest generation compared with the previous generation within a pedigree.

Eventually, the C9ORF72 repeat units number influenced the disease phenotype in terms of age of onset and associated clinical subtype. Genome-wide studies in well characterized clinical cohorts will be essential in order to decipher pathways of disease expression in C9ORF72-associated neurodegeneration.",

BACKGROUND: Dyskeratosis congenita is a cancer-prone bone marrow failure syndrome caused by aberrations in telomere biology. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 65 patients with dyskeratosis congenita and 127 unaffected relatives. Telomere length was measured by automated multicolor flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in peripheral blood leukocyte subsets. We age-adjusted telomere length using Z-scores (standard deviations from the mean for age). RESULTS: We confirmed that telomere lengths below the first percentile for age are very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of dyskeratosis congenita. We provide evidence that lymphocytes alone and not granulocytes may suffice for clinical screening, while lymphocyte subsets may be required for challenging cases, including identification of silent carriers. We show for the first time using flow fluorescence in situ hybridization that the shortest telomeres are associated with severe variants (Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes), mutations in DKC1, TINF2, or unknown genes, and moderate or severe aplastic anemia. In the first longitudinal follow up of dyskeratosis congenita patients, we demonstrate that telomere lengths decline with age, in contrast to the apparent stable telomere length observed in cross-sectional data. CONCLUSIONS: Telomere length by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization is an important diagnostic test for dyskeratosis congenita; age-adjusted values provide a quantitative measure of disease severity (clinical subset, mutated gene, and degree of bone marrow failure). Patients with dyskeratosis congenita have accelerated telomere shortening. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT00027274).",

The cardiac ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel (RyR2) is an essential sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein that plays a central role in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in cardiomyocytes. Aberrant spontaneous, diastolic Ca2+ leak from the SR due to dysfunctional RyR2 contributes to the formation of delayed after-depolarisations, which are thought to underlie the fatal arrhythmia that occurs in both heart failure (HF) and in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT is an inherited disorder associated with mutations in either the RyR2 or a SR luminal protein, calsequestrin. RyR2 shows normal function at rest in CPVT but the RyR2 dysfunction is unmasked by physical exercise or emotional stress, suggesting abnormal RyR2 activation as an underlying mechanism. Several potential mechanisms have been advanced to explain the dysfunctional RyR2 observed in HF and CPVT, including enhanced RyR2 phosphorylation status, altered RyR2 regulation at luminal/cytoplasmic sites and perturbed RyR2 intra/inter-molecular interactions. This review considers RyR2 dysfunction in the context of the structural and functional modulation of the channel, and potential therapeutic strategies to stabilise RyR2 function in cardiac pathology.",

UNLABELLED: 99mTc-Labeled annexin V has been used for the imaging of tumor apoptosis induced by chemotherapy. However, owing to the short half-life of annexin V, multiple injections of the radiotracer are necessary to capture the peak apoptotic activity. In this study, we evaluated the imaging properties of an (111)In-labeled, long-circulating annexin V. METHODS: Both polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were simultaneously introduced to annexin V or ovalbumin through the use of a heterofunctional PEG precursor. Imaging studies were performed in mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated human mammary MDA-MB-468 tumors. The mice were treated with poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel, monoclonal antibody C225, or a combination of poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel and C225, followed by intravenous injection of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V. Images were acquired 48 h after the injection of the radiotracer. Autoradiography and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) staining were performed on adjacent tumor slices for the localization of apoptotic cells. The imaging properties of unPEGylated annexin V and PEGylated ovalbumin were also determined to permit assessment of the specificity of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V. RESULTS: Tumor apoptotic index increased from 1.67% +/- 0.31% at baseline to 7.60% +/- 0.72% and 11.07% +/- 1.81%, respectively, 4 d after treatment with poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel or combined poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel and C225. Tumor uptake (percentage of injected dose per gram of tumor [%ID/g]) of PEGylated (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin 4 d after treatment was significantly higher in tumors treated with poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel (10.76 +/- 1.38 %ID/g; P = 0.001) and with combined poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel and C225 (9.84 +/- 2.51 %ID/g; P = 0.029) than in nontreated tumors (6.14 +/- 0.67 %ID/g), resulting in enhanced visualization of treated tumors. (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V distributed into the central zone of tumors, whereas (111)In-DTPA-annexin V was largely confined to the tumor periphery. Furthermore, uptake of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V by tumors correlated with apoptotic index (r = 0.87, P = 0.02). Increase in tumor uptake of the nonspecific PEGylated protein (111)In-DTPA-PEG-ovalbumin was also observed after poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel treatment (55.6%), although this increase was less than that observed for (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V (96.7%). CONCLUSION: Increased uptake of and improved visualization with (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V in solid tumors after chemotherapy are mediated through both specific binding to apoptotic cells and nonspecific retention of macromolecular contrast agents in the tumors. (111)In-Labeled, PEGylated annexin V may be used to assess tumor response to chemotherapy.",

INTRODUCTION: Chloroquine is a drug that is widely used in rheumatology and occasionally prescribed in dermatology. From a neurotoxicological point of view, chloroquine can have effects on the peripheral nerves, muscles, neuromuscular junctions and the central nervous system. In this study we analyse the clinical, neurophysiological and anatomopathological findings in two patients with chloroquine induced neuromyopathy, which took the form of a polyradiculoneuropathy. CASE REPORTS: Case 1: a 75 year old female with rheumatoid arthritis treated with daily doses of 250 mg of chloroquine for four years. The patient visited because of several months history of predominantly proximal progressive tetraparesis with areflexia. Analytical tests and lumbar puncture were normal. Electromyogram (EMG): proximal myopathic and distal neuropathic patterns. Muscular biopsy: vacuolar myopathy with accumulations of phagolysosomes, lipids, lipofuscin, myelinic curvilinear bodies. Case 2: a 74 year old female with arthropathy treated with daily doses of 250 mg of chloroquine for nine months. The patient presented a progressive proximal paraparesis with generalised areflexia. Analytical tests and lumbar puncture were normal. EMG: mixed sensory motor polyneuropathy, myogenic pattern with high frequency discharges in the iliac psoas and a neurogenic pattern in the distal muscles. Muscular biopsy: vacuolar myopathy suggesting a myopathy due to chloroquine. After stopping treatment with this drug the patients progressed favourably. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine can induce a clinical pattern that suggests a polyradiculoneuropathy. It is important to establish a history of having taken this drug. If this is indeed the case, then an electromyographic study of the most proximal muscles should be performed in order to detect a myogenic pattern and the same exploration should be applied to the distal muscles to reveal a neurogenic pattern. The final diagnosis will be established by muscular biopsy.",

BACKGROUND: TTN-encoded titin, CSRP3-encoded muscle LIM protein, and TCAP-encoded telethonin are Z-disc proteins essential for the structural organization of the cardiac sarcomere and the cardiomyocyte's stretch sensor. All three genes have been established as cardiomyopathy-associated genes for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we sought to characterize the frequency, spectrum, and phenotype associated with HCM-associated mutations in these three genes in a large cohort of unrelated patients evaluated at a single tertiary outpatient center. METHODS: DNA was obtained from 389 patients with HCM (215 male, left ventricular wall thickness of 21.6+/-6 mm) and analyzed for mutations involving all translated exons of CSRP3 and TCAP and targeted HCM-associated exons (2, 3, 4, and 14) of TTN using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and direct DNA sequencing. Clinical data were extracted from patient records and maintained independent of the genotype. RESULTS: Overall, 16 patients (4.1%) harbored a Z-disc mutation: 12 had a MLP mutation and 4 patients a TCAP mutation. No TTN mutations were detected. Seven patients were also found to have a concomitant myofilament mutation. Seven patients with a MLP-mutation were found to harbor the DCM-associated, functionally characterized W4R mutation. W4R-MLP was also noted in a single white control subject. Patients with MLP/TCAP-associated HCM clinically mimicked myofilament-HCM. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 4.1% of unrelated patients had HCM-associated MLP or TCAP mutations. MLP/TCAP-HCM phenotypically mirrors myofilament-HCM and is more severe than the subset of patients who still remain without a disease-causing mutation. The precise role of W4R-MLP in the pathogenesis of either DCM or HCM warrants further investigation.",

Since telomerase has been recognized as a relevant factor distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, it has become a very promising target for anti-cancer therapy. A correlation between short telomere length and increased mortality was revealed in many studies. The telomerase expression/activity appears to be one of the most crucial factors to study to improve cancer therapy and prevention. However, this multisubunit enzymatic complex can be regulated at various levels. Thus, several strategies have been proposed to control telomerase in cancer cells such as anti-sense technology against TR and TERT, ribozymes against TERT, anti-estrogens, progesterone, vitamin D, retinoic acid, quadruplex stabilizers, telomere and telomerase targeting agents, modulation of interaction with other proteins involved in the regulation of telomerase and telomeres, etc. However, the transcription control of key telomerase subunits seems to play the crucial role in whole complexes activity and cancer cells immortality.

Pneumonic plague is a deadly respiratory disease caused by Yersinia pestis.

Here we show that Pla degrades the apoptotic signaling molecule Fas ligand (FasL) to prevent host cell apoptosis and inflammation. Wild-type Y.\u00a0pestis, but not a Pla mutant (\u0394pla), degrades FasL, which results in decreased downstream caspase-3/7 activation and reduced apoptosis.

Consistent with a role for FasL in regulating immune responses, \u0394pla infection results in aberrant proinflammatory cytokine levels. The loss of FasL or inhibition of caspase activity alters host inflammatory responses and enables enhanced Y.\u00a0pestis outgrowth in the lungs.

Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian man who presented with mild anaemia and tiredness. His anaemia was investigated and ascribed to senescence. Endocrine causes were not considered or tested for. Six years later, he was again referred. Reassessment and direct questioning revealed long-standing sexual dysfunction. It was also discovered that our patient had fractured his radius twice, with minor trauma, during the preceding year. His serum prolactin was massively increased and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrated a pituitary mass consistent with a prolactinoma. Dual X-ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis. Treatment of the prolactinoma led to a reduction in his serum prolactin with a rise in his haemoglobin to normal levels. This suggested that the prolactinoma was present during the initial presentation and was the cause of his anaemia.

OBJECTIVE: This report highlights the use of biologic agents for the treatment of recalcitrant HS. METHOD: We report on a 48-year-old male with a 15-year history of refractory perianal-inguinal-buttock HS who, despite receiving numerous surgical drainages and traditional medical treatment for HS, still had severe pain. After trialing etanercept and infliximab with methotrexate, the patient had marked improvement with adalimumab. A literature review of biologics therapy was also performed. RESULTS: After trialing many traditional therapies, we found that adalimumab appears to be the most effective treatment modality for our patient. A literature search revealed 53 articles on biologics therapy in HS. These articles are summarized. DISCUSSION: Biologic agents have been shown to have variable results in the treatment of refractory HS. Enough low-grade evidence has been accumulated to make the use of these agents suitable in HS.

BACKGROUND: According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. METHODS: Cardiovascular examination was performed in three affected and five at-risk members of a family from Poland, histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy was done in a single patient, and functional analysis of mutant desmin protein was carried out in cultured cells. RESULTS: Cardiovascular assessment led to the diagnosis of RCM in affected family members. Histopathological study of skeletal muscle biopsy revealed features characteristic of desmin myopathy. A novel desmin E413K mutation was identified in each affected family member, but not unrelated controls. The pathogenicity of the E413K mutation was confirmed in transfected cell cultures showing inability of mutant desmin to form a cellular filamentous network or support a pre-existing network formed by other intermediate filaments. Three-dimensional modeling and electrostatic calculations indicated that the E413K mutation located in a functionally unique domain of desmin molecule potentially disrupts intramolecular interactions. Analysis of previously reported observations indicates that RCM in desminopathy patients may be as frequent as DCM. CONCLUSIONS: A novel E413K mutation in desmin caused autosomal dominant RCM rather than DCM. The location of the E413K mutation at a highly conserved end of the alpha-helical rod domain may be related to the phenotypic differences from the previously described DCM-associated desmin mutations.

Depressed cardiac Ca cycling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) has been associated with attenuated contractility, which can progress to heart failure. The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is an SR component that binds to triadin and may affect Ca release through the ryanodine receptor. HRC overexpression in transgenic mouse hearts was associated with decreased rates of SR Ca uptake and delayed relaxation, which progressed to hypertrophy with aging. The present study shows that HRC may mediate part of its regulatory effects by binding directly to sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase type 2 (SERCA2) in cardiac muscle, which is confirmed by coimmunostaining observed under confocal microscopy. This interaction involves the histidine- and glutamic acid-rich domain of HRC (320-460 aa) and the part of the NH(2)-terminal cation transporter domain of SERCA2 (74-90 aa) that projects into the SR lumen. The SERCA2-binding domain is upstream from the triadin-binding region in human HRC (609-699 aa). Specific binding between HRC and SERCA was verified by coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays using human and mouse cardiac homogenates and by blot overlays using glutathione S-transferase and maltose-binding protein recombinant proteins. Importantly, increases in Ca concentration were associated with a significant reduction of HRC binding to SERCA2, whereas they had opposite effects on the HRC-triadin interaction in cardiac homogenates. Collectively, our data suggest that HRC may play a key role in the regulation of SR Ca cycling through its direct interactions with SERCA2 and triadin, mediating a fine cross talk between SR Ca uptake and release in the heart.",

Divalent metal transporter-1 (SLC11A2/DMT1) uses the H(+) electrochemical gradient as the driving force to transport divalent metal ions such as Fe(2+), Mn(2+) and others metals into mammalian cells. DMT1 is ubiquitously expressed, most notably in proximal duodenum, immature erythroid cells, brain and kidney. This transporter mediates H(+)-coupled transport of ferrous iron across the apical membrane of enterocytes. In addition, in cells such as to erythroid precursors, following transferrin receptor (TfR) mediated endocytosis; it mediates H(+)-coupled exit of ferrous iron from endocytic vesicles into the cytosol. Dysfunction of human DMT1 is associated with several pathologies such as iron deficiency anemia hemochromatosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as colorectal cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma, making DMT1 an attractive target for drug discovery. In the present study, we performed a ligand-based virtual screening of the Princeton database (700,000 commercially available compounds) to search for pharmacophore shape analogs of recently reported DMT1 inhibitors. We discovered a new compound, named pyrimidinone 8, which mediates a reversible linear non-competitive inhibition of human DMT1 (hDMT1) transport activity with a Ki of \u223c20\u03bcM. This compound does not affect hDMT1 cell surface expression and shows no dependence on extracellular pH.

A computational model that can accurately predict splicing patterns based on genomic features and cellular context is highly desirable, both in understanding this widespread phenomenon, and in exploring the effects of genetic variations on AS. METHODS: Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. RESULTS: We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset.

RNA methylation modifications have been found for decades of years, which occur at different RNA types of numerous species, and their distribution is species-specific. However, people rarely know their biological functions. There are several identified methylation modifications in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), such as N(7)-methylguanosine (m(7)G) at the cap, N(6)-methyl-2'-O-methyladenosine (m(6)Am), 2'-O-methylation (Nm) within the cap and the internal positions, and internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C). Among them, m(7)G cap was studied more clearly and found to have vital roles in several important mRNA processes like mRNA translation, stability and nuclear export. m(6)A as the most abundant modification in mRNA was found in the 1970s and has been proposed to function in mRNA splicing, translation, stability, transport and so on. m(6)A has been discovered as the first RNA reversible modification which is demethylated directly by human fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) and its homolog protein, alkylation repair homolog 5 (ALKBH5). FTO has a special demethylation mechanism that demethylases m(6)A to A through two over-oxidative intermediate states: N(6)-hydroxymethyladenosine (hm(6)A) and N(6)-formyladenosine (f(6)A). The two newly discovered m(6)A demethylases, FTO and ALKBH5, significantly control energy homeostasis and spermatogenesis, respectively, indicating that the dynamic and reversible m(6)A, analogous to DNA and histone modifications, plays broad roles in biological kingdoms and brings us an emerging field \"RNA Epigenetics\". 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as an epigenetic mark in DNA has been studied widely, but m(5)C in mRNA is seldom explored. The bisulfide sequencing showed m(5)C is another abundant modification in mRNA, suggesting that it might be another RNA epigenetic mark. This review focuses on the main methylation modifications in mRNA to describe their formation, distribution, function and demethylation from the current knowledge and to provide future perspectives on functional studies.",

Germline silencing of transposable elements is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Recent results indicate that this repression is largely achieved through a RNA silencing pathway that involves Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). However the repressive mechanisms are not well understood. To address this question, we used the possibility to disrupt the repression of the Drosophila I element retrotransposon by hybrid dysgenesis. We show here that the repression of the functional I elements that are located in euchromatin requires proteins of the piRNA pathway, and that the amount of ovarian I element piRNAs correlates with the strength of the repression in the female germline. Antisense RNAs, which are likely used to produce antisense piRNAs, are transcribed by heterochromatic defective I elements, but efficient production of these antisense small RNAs requires the presence in the genome of euchromatic functional I elements. Finally, we demonstrate that the piRNA-induced silencing of the functional I elements is at least partially posttranscriptional. In a repressive background, these elements are still transcribed, but some of their sense transcripts are kept in nurse cell nuclear foci together with those of the Doc retrotransposon. In the absence of I element piRNAs, either in dysgenic females or in mutants of the piRNA silencing pathway, sense I element transcripts are transported toward the oocyte where retrotransposition occurs. Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation.",

OBJECTIVE: The adverse impact of depression in relation to survival among cancer patients is currently a subject of great interest in research. In a 5-year follow-up study, we investigated the association of depression with survival of patients with a primary brain tumor. METHODS: The study population consisted of 75 patients with a solitary primary brain tumor treated surgically at the Oulu Clinic for Neurosurgery, Oulu University Hospital, in Northern Finland. The patients were interviewed during admission to the hospital for the tumor surgery. Assessment of depression was made using the Beck Depression Inventory and the Crown-Crisp Experiential Index. Information on all deaths within 60 months after tumor operation was collected from the Cause of Death Register, provided by Statistics Finland. RESULTS: The patients with a high-grade glioma had a survival time of 22.5 months (standard deviation, 21.4 mo), whereas the corresponding time was 50.2 months (standard deviation, 19.9 mo) for patients with a low-grade glioma and 58.2 months (standard deviation, 9.4 mo) for the patients with a histologically benign tumor (P < 0.001, difference between groups, Kruskal-Wallis test). In the subgroup of patients with low-grade gliomas, depressive patients had a significantly shorter survival time compared with nondepressive subjects (P = 0.031, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis). A corresponding difference was not found in patients with high-grade gliomas or benign tumors. Tumor location in one hemisphere compared with bilateral location and wider extent of tumor surgery was associated with better survival in patients with low-grade gliomas and benign tumors but not in patients with high-grade gliomas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative depression seemed to be a significant prognostic factor for worse survival in low-grade glioma patients. In clinical practice, an evaluation of depression among brain tumor patients by structured and standardized diagnostic methods is needed to distinguish the patients whose depression actually needs treatment. The effective treatment of clinical depression among brain tumor patients and the impact of treatment on the patients' chances of survival should be a focus of future research.",

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. However, this disease affects both males and females. In Turkey, the frequency of this enzyme deficiency was reported to vary, from 0.25 to 18%, by the geographical area. Its prevalence in the northern Black Sea region of Turkey is unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the northern region Turkey in children and adults with hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia. This report included a total of 976 G6PD enzyme results that were analyzed between May 2005 and January 2014. G6PD deficiency was detected in 5.0% of all patients. G6PD deficiency was significantly less frequent in females (1.9%, 6/323) than in males (6.6%, 43/653). G6PD deficiency was detected in 3.7% of infants with hyperbilirubinemia, 9.2% of children, and 4.5% of adults with hemolytic anemia. In both the newborn group and the group of children, G6PD deficiency was significantly more frequent in males. In the combined group of children (groups I and II), the proportion of males was 74% and 67% in all groups (P = .0008). In conclusion, in northern region of Turkey, G6PD deficiency is an important cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic crisis in children and adults.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone acts via receptor subtypes (TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, TR\u03b22) with differing tissue distributions, encoded by distinct genes (THRA, THRB). THRB mutations cause a disorder with central (hypothalamic-pituitary) resistance to thyroid hormone action with markedly elevated thyroid hormone and normal TSH levels. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review describes the clinical features, genetic and molecular pathogenesis of a homologous human disorder mediated by defective THRA. Clinical features include growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia and constipation associated with low-normal T4 and high-normal T3 levels and a low T4/T3 ratio, together with subnormal reverse T3 levels. Heterozygous TRa1 mutations in affected individuals generate defective mutant receptors which inhibit wild-type receptor action in a dominant negative manner. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in human TR\u03b11 mediate RTH with features of hypothyroidism in particular tissues (e.g. skeleton, gastrointestinal tract), but are not associated with a markedly dysregulated pituitary-thyroid axis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Human THRA mutations could be more common but may have eluded discovery due to the absence of overt thyroid dysfunction. Nevertheless, in the appropriate clinical context, a thyroid biochemical signature (low T4/T3 ratio, subnormal reverse T3 levels), may enable future identification of cases.

OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of using a full-time project nurse to assist residential aged care facilities in using evidence-based approaches to falls injury prevention. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomised controlled trial involving 5391 residents in 88 aged care facilities in the Hunter and Lower Mid North Coast areas of New South Wales. Residents were followed for 545 days or until death or discharge. Data were collected from July 2005 to June 2007. INTERVENTION: Employment of a project nurse to encourage best-practice falls injury prevention strategies during the 17-month intervention period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly data about falls, falls injury and falls injury prevention programs; audit of hospitalisation for fractured neck of femur. RESULTS: Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall. There was also no difference between the 7-month pre-intervention period and the intervention period in the number of falls or falls injuries. Factors related to residents having an increased risk of falls with fractured neck of femur included being ambulant, having dementia, increasing age, and having a high falls risk assessment score. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to change falls risk among high-risk populations, including people with dementia. The use of important strategies such as hip protectors and vitamin D and calcium supplementation increased during the study, probably with contamination of control facilities.

The inactivation of FA genes, in particular FANCF, has also been documented in sporadic tumours in non-FA patients. To study whether there is a causal relationship between FA pathway defects and tumour development, we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the FA core complex gene Fancf. Fancf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed a phenotype typical for FA cells: they showed an aberrant response to DNA cross-linking agents as manifested by G(2) arrest, chromosomal aberrations, reduced survival, and an inability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. Fancf homozygous mice were viable, born following a normal Mendelian distribution, and showed no growth retardation or developmental abnormalities. The gonads of Fancf mutant mice functioned abnormally, showing compromised follicle development and spermatogenesis as has been observed in other FA mouse models and in FA patients. In a cohort of Fancf-deficient mice, we observed decreased overall survival and increased tumour incidence. Notably, in seven female mice, six ovarian tumours developed: five granulosa cell tumours and one luteoma. One mouse had developed tumours in both ovaries. High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on these tumours suggests that the increased incidence of ovarian tumours correlates with the infertility in Fancf-deficient mice and the genomic instability characteristic of FA pathway deficiency.",

In this study, we establish sorbitol as a novel physiological stressor that directs TDP-43 to stress granules in Hek293T cells and primary cultured glia. We quantify the association of TDP-43 with stress granules over time and show that stress granule association and size are dependent on the glycine-rich region of TDP-43, which harbors the majority of pathogenic mutations. Moreover, we establish that cells harboring wild-type and mutant TDP-43 have distinct stress responses: mutant TDP-43 forms significantly larger stress granules, and is incorporated into stress granules earlier, than wild-type TDP-43; in striking contrast, wild-type TDP-43 forms more stress granules over time, but the granule size remains relatively unchanged.

Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library. The full-length cDNA comprised 1798 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 473 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the zebrafish desmin shares a high degree of similarity to other vertebrate desmins, but also contains a sequence at the carboxyl terminal of the tail domain that is unique to the zebrafish. It carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the 3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins. The onset of expression and the spatial localization of desmin mRNA in the zebrafish coincides with that reported for MyoD and myogenin.",

Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like protein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process.",

Differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells into specialized decidual cells is critical for embryo implantation and survival of the conceptus. Initiation of this differentiation process is strictly dependent on elevated cAMP levels, but the signal intermediates that control the expression of decidual marker genes, such as prolactin (PRL) and IGFBP1, remain poorly characterized. Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively. Time-course analysis demonstrated that cAMP enhances endogenous reactive oxygen species production, apparent after 12 h of stimulation, which coincides with a dramatic increase in decidual PRL and IGFBP1 expression. Knockdown of the Rho GTPase RAC1, which disables activation of the NADPH oxidase homologs NADPH oxidase (NOX)-1, NOX-2, and NOX-3, had no effect on PRL or IGFBP1 expression. In contrast, silencing of NOX-4, or its cofactor p22(PHOX), inhibited the expression of both decidual markers. Finally, we show that the NOX-4/p22(PHOX) complex regulates the DNA-binding activity of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b2, a key regulator of human endometrial stromal cell differentiation. Thus, NOX-4 activation and reactive oxygen species signaling play an integral role in initiating the endometrial decidual response in preparation of pregnancy.",

When challenged to acute cold (4 \u00b0C), Sln(-/-) mice were not able to maintain their core body temperature (37 \u00b0C) and developed hypothermia. Surgical ablation of brown adipose tissue and functional knockdown of Ucp1 allowed us to highlight the role of muscle in NST. Overexpression of Sln in the Sln-null background fully restored muscle-based thermogenesis, suggesting that Sln is the basis for Serca-mediated heat production. We show that ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1)-mediated Ca(2+) leak is an important mechanism for Serca-activated heat generation. Here we present data to suggest that Sln can continue to interact with Serca in the presence of Ca(2+), which can promote uncoupling of the Serca pump and cause futile cycling. We further show that loss of Sln predisposes mice to diet-induced obesity, which suggests that Sln-mediated NST is recruited during metabolic overload.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.",

In this study, we used both in vivo and in vitro paradigms to determine whether alterations in macroautophagy affect APP metabolism. Three mouse models of glycosphingolipid storage diseases, namely Niemann-Pick type C1, GM1 gangliosidosis, and Sandhoff disease, had mTOR-independent increases in the autophagic vacuole (AV)-associated protein, LC3-II, indicative of impaired lysosomal flux. APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) were also increased in brains of the three mouse models; however, discrepancies between LC3-II and APP-CTFs were seen between primary (GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) and secondary (Niemann-Pick type C1) lysosomal storage models. APP-CTFs were proportionately higher than LC3-II in cerebellar regions of GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease, although LC3-II increased before APP-CTFs in brains of NPC1 mice. Endogenous murine A\u03b240 from RIPA-soluble extracts was increased in brains of all three mice. The in vivo relationship between AV and APP-CTF accumulation was also seen in cultured neurons treated with agents that impair primary (chloroquine and leupeptin + pepstatin) and secondary (U18666A and vinblastine) lysosomal flux. However, A\u03b2 secretion was unaffected by agents that induced autophagy (rapamycin) or impaired AV clearance, and LC3-II-positive AVs predominantly co-localized with degradative LAMP-1-positive lysosomes. These data suggest that neuronal macroautophagy does not directly regulate APP metabolism but highlights the important anti-amyloidogenic role of lysosomal proteolysis in post-secretase APP-CTF catabolism.",

Initial platelet proteomic research focused on general proteome mapping followed by the exploration of sub-cellular compartments, the membrane proteome, and signaling pathways.

The success of these studies led to the application of platelet proteomics to the study of several pathologies where platelets play a fundamental role.

If the victim's test is positive, this information is important for relatives who might be themselves at risk of carrying the disease-causing mutation. There is no consensus about how professionals should proceed in this context. This article discusses the ethical and legal arguments in favour of and against three options: genetic testing of the deceased victim only; counselling of relatives before testing the victim; counselling restricted to relatives of victims who tested positive for mutations of serious and preventable diseases. Legal cases are mentioned that pertain to the duty of geneticists and other physicians to warn relatives. Although the claim for a legal duty is tenuous, recent publications and guidelines suggest that geneticists and others involved in the multidisciplinary approach of sudden death (SD) cases may, nevertheless, have an ethical duty to inform relatives of SD victims.

BACKGROUND: There has been recent interest in the possible role of reperfusion-induced inflammation with neuronal injury after stroke. Enlimomab, a murine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibody, reduces leukocyte adhesion and infarct size in experimental stroke studies. The purpose of the current clinical trial was to evaluate the use of enlimomab after ischemic stroke. METHODS: A total of 625 patients with ischemic stroke were randomized to receive either enlimomab (n = 317) or placebo (n = 308) within 6 hours of stroke onset. Treatment was given over 5 days. Patients were evaluated at baseline and on days 5 and 90 after initiation of treatment; long-term assessments were carried out after 6 and 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the response to therapy at 90 days on the Modified Rankin Scale; other endpoints included Barthel Index (BI) and NIH Stroke Scale and survival. RESULTS: At day 90, the Modified Rankin Scale score was worse in patients treated with enlimomab than with placebo (p = 0.004). Fewer patients had symptom-free recovery on enlimomab than placebo (p = 0.004), and more died (22.2 versus 16.2%). The negative effect of enlimomab was apparent on days 5, 30, and 90 of treatment (p = 0.005). There were significantly more adverse events with enlimomab treatment than placebo, primarily infections and fever. Patients experiencing fever were more likely to have a poor outcome or die. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.",

Canonical WNT signals are transduced through Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 coreceptor to downregulate GSK3beta (GSK3B) activity not depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. FGF signals are transduced through FGF receptor to the FRS2-GRB2-GAB1-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade to downregulate GSK3beta activity depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. Because GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin and SNAIL leads to FBXW1 (betaTRCP)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, GSK3beta downregulation results in the stabilization and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and SNAIL. Nuclear beta-catenin is complexed with TCF/LEF, Legless (BCL9 or BCL9L) and PYGO (PYGO1 or PYGO2) to activate transcription of CCND1, MYC, FGF18 and FGF20 genes for the cell-fate determination. Nuclear SNAIL represses transcription of CDH1 gene, encoding E-cadherin, to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the efficacy of golimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -\u03b1, for treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We evaluated subcutaneous golimumab induction therapy in TNF-\u03b1 antagonist-na\u00efve patients with moderate-to-severe UC despite conventional treatment. METHODS: We integrated double-blind phase 2 dose-finding and phase 3 dose-confirmation trials in a study of 1064 adults with UC (Mayo score: 6-12; endoscopic subscore > 2; 774 patients in phase 3). Patients were randomly assigned to groups given golimumab doses of 100 mg and then 50 mg (phase 2 only), 200 mg and then 100 mg, or 400 mg and then 200 mg, 2 weeks apart. The phase 3 primary end point was week-6 clinical response. Secondary end points included week-6 clinical remission, mucosal healing, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score change. RESULTS: In phase 2, median changes from baseline in the Mayo score were -1.0, -3.0, -2.0, and -3.0, in the groups given placebo, 100 mg/50 mg, 200/100 mg, and 400/200 mg golimumab, respectively. In phase 3, rates of clinical response at week 6 were 51.0% and 54.9% among patients given 200 mg/100 mg and 400 mg/200 mg golimumab, respectively, vs 30.3% among those given placebo (both, P < .0001). Rates of clinical remission and mucosal healing and mean changes in IBDQ scores were significantly greater in both golimumab groups vs the placebo group (P < .0014, all comparisons). Rates of serious adverse events were 6.1% and 3.0%, and rates of serious infection were 1.8% and 0.5%, in the placebo and golimumab groups, respectively. One patient in the 400 mg/200 mg group died as a result of surgical complications of an ischiorectal abscess. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with subcutaneous golimumab induces clinical response, remission, and mucosal healing, and increases quality of life in larger percentages of patients with active UC than placebo.

CD99, the product of the MIC2 gene, exhibits an erythroid-specific quantitative polymorphism coregulated with the polymorphism of the XG blood group gene. As a preliminary study of this phenomenon, human XG and CD99 recombinant proteins were expressed in murine RAG cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. Both proteins were expressed independently and at a similar level in single and double transfectants. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, using the murine monoclonal antibodies NBL-1 and 12E7, revealed species of 26 kd (XG) and 32 kd (CD99), respectively. A putative 28-kd intracellular precursor of CD99 was also detected, as was a 26-kd species after neuraminidase treatment of CD99-expressing cells. No evidence of association or complex formation between XG and CD99 proteins could be proven, either on transfected RAG cells or on human erythrocytes. These results were confirmed using somatic hybrids between single transfectants. These findings suggest that the phenotypic relationship between XG and CD99 is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level, but they do not formally exclude some posttranscriptional effect. Studies on the tissue specificity of XG expression showed that surface expression of the XG protein could not be restored in somatic hybrids between B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from Xg(a+) persons and fibroblasts (RAG) or erythroid (MEL) cells. RT-PCR analysis of the transcripts revealed the existence of an XG mRNA in each cell line, suggesting that the tissue-specific regulation of cell surface XG expression occurs either at a quantitative transcriptional level or is a posttranscriptional event. By Northern blot analysis, XG transcripts were detected in erythroid tissues and several nonerythroid tissues. (Blood. 2000;95:1819-1826)",

Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). This cyclic mechanism constitutes the driving force for calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm into the myocite lumen, regulating cardiac contractility. PLN undergoes a conformational transition between a relaxed (R) and tense (T) state, an equilibrium perturbed by the addition of SERCA. Here, we show that the single phosphoryl transfer at Ser16 induces a more pronounced conformational switch to the R state in phosphorylated PLN (pPLN). The binding affinity of PLN to SERCA is not affected (K(d) values for the transmembrane domains of pPLN and PLN are approximately 60 microM), supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation at Ser16 does not dissociate PLN from SERCA. However, the binding surface and dynamics in domain Ib (residues 22-31) change substantially upon phosphorylation. Since PLN can be singly or doubly phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17, we propose that these sites remotely control the conformation of domain Ib. These findings constitute a paradigm for how post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic portion of membrane proteins control intramembrane protein-protein interactions.",

The aim was to investigate the influence of changes in thyroid function during postnatal development on the prevalence of T1DM in BB rats and the influence of T3 on the beta cell mass in non-diabetic Wistar rats. BB rats were treated with sodium iodine (NaI) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) neonatally or with tri-iodo-thyronine (T3) during adolescence. At the age of 19 weeks the incidence of T1DM and the degree of insulitis were evaluated. The influence of T3 treatment on the beta cell mass was evaluated in Wistar rats by unbiased stereological methods. The incidence of T1DM in control BB rats was 68% at the age of 19 weeks. NaI and T3 reduced the incidence, whereas TSH had no effect. In Wistar rats T3 treatment increased the beta cell mass per bodyweight. The modulation of thyroid function during postnatal development may thus affect the precipitation of T1DM in genetically susceptible individuals.",

METHODS: Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography was used to determine 8-MOP plasma levels in eight patients with palmoplantar psoriasis and two with eczema. Three patients receiving oral PUVA therapy served as the control group. RESULTS: Plasma levels of 8-MOP taken 1, 6, and 24 hours after topical PUVA treatments of patients with palmoplantar psoriasis were undetectable.

One of the most challenging goals of hepatitis C virus (HCV) research is to develop well-tolerated regimens with high cure rates across a variety of patient populations. Such a regimen will likely require a combination of at least two distinct direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Combining two or more DAAs with different resistance profiles increases the number of mutations required for viral breakthrough. Currently, most DAAs inhibit HCV replication. We recently reported that the combination of two distinct classes of HCV inhibitors, entry inhibitors and replication inhibitors, prolonged reductions in extracellular HCV in persistently infected cells. We therefore sought to identify new inhibitors targeting aspects of the HCV replication cycle other than RNA replication. We report here the discovery of the first small-molecule HCV infectivity inhibitor, GS-563253, also called HCV infectivity inhibitor 1 (HCV II-1). HCV II-1 is a substituted tetrahydroquinoline that selectively inhibits genotype 1 and 2 HCVs with low-nanomolar 50% effective concentrations. It was identified through a high-throughput screen and subsequent chemical optimization. HCV II-1 only permits the production and release of noninfectious HCV particles from cells. Moreover, infectious HCV is rapidly inactivated in its presence. HCV II-1 resistance mutations map to HCV E2. In addition, HCV-II prevents HCV endosomal fusion, suggesting that it either locks the viral envelope in its prefusion state or promotes a viral envelope conformation change incapable of fusion. Importantly, the discovery of HCV II-1 opens up a new class of HCV inhibitors that prolong viral suppression by HCV replication inhibitors in persistently infected cell cultures.",

BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions are increasingly used to support self-management of individuals with chronic illnesses. Web-based interventions may also be effective in enhancing self-management for individuals with chronic pain, but little is known about long-term effects. Research on Web-based interventions to support self-management following participation in pain management programs is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the long-term effects of a 4-week smartphone-intervention with diaries and therapist-written feedback following an inpatient chronic pain rehabilitation program, previously found to be effective at short-term and 5-month follow-ups. METHODS: 140 women with chronic widespread pain, participating in a 4-week inpatient rehabilitation program, were randomized into two groups: with or without a smartphone intervention after the rehabilitation. The smartphone intervention consisted of one face-to-face individual session and 4 weeks of written communication via a smartphone, consisting of three diaries daily to elicit pain-related thoughts, feelings, and activities, as well as daily personalized written feedback based on cognitive behavioral principles from a therapist. Both groups were given access to an informational website to promote constructive self-management. Outcomes were measured with self-reported paper-and-pencil format questionnaires with catastrophizing as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included daily functioning and symptom levels, acceptance of pain, and emotional distress. RESULTS: By the 11-month follow-up, the favorable between-group differences previously reported post-intervention and at 5-month follow-up on catastrophizing, acceptance, functioning, and symptom level were no longer evident (P>.10). However, there was more improvement in catastrophizing scores during the follow-up period in the intervention group (M=-2.36, SD 8.41) compared to the control group (M=.40, SD 7.20), P=.045. Also, per protocol within-group analysis showed a small positive effect (Cohen's d=.33) on catastrophizing in the intervention group (P=.04) and no change in the control group from the smartphone intervention baseline to 11-month follow-up. A positive effect (Cohen's d=.73) on acceptance was found within the intervention group (P<.001) but not in the control group. Small to large negative effects were found within the control group on functioning and symptom levels, emotional distress, and fatigue (P=.05) from the intervention baseline to the 11-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The long-term results of this randomized trial are ambiguous. No significant between-group effect was found on the study variables at 11-month follow-up. However, the within-group analyses, comparing the baseline for the smartphone intervention to the 11-month data, indicated changes in the desired direction in catastrophizing and acceptance in the intervention group but not within the control group. This study provides modest evidence supporting the long-term effect of the intervention.

In adult DS cortex we found that Notch1, Dll1 and Hes1 expression is up-regulated. Moreover, DS fibroblasts and Alzheimer disease cortex also show overexpression of Notch1 and Dll1, indicating that enhanced beta-APP processing found in both DS and AD could be instrumental in these changes. Using pull-down studies we could demonstrate interaction of APP with Notch1, suggesting that these transmembrane proteins form heterodimers, but independent of gamma-secretase. We could demonstrate binding of the intracellular domain of Notch1 to the APP adaptor protein Fe65. Furthermore, activated Notch1 can trans-activate an APP target gene, Kai1, and vice versa, activated APP can trans-activate the classical Notch target gene Hes1.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) and other anthracyclines is limited by a dosage-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. The role of the individual genetic makeup in this disorder is poorly understood. Alterations in genes encoding cardiac cytoskeleton or sarcolemma proteins may increase the susceptibility to doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Female dystrophin-deficient mice (MDX) and age-matched wild-type mice underwent chronic treatment with doxorubicin. Cardiac function and tissue damage were assessed by echocardiography and histopathology, respectively. Gene expression changes were investigated using microarrays. RESULTS: DOX treatment resulted in mortality, cardiac insufficiency, and cardiac interstitial fibrosis. These alterations were more pronounced in DOX-treated MDX mice than in DOX-treated wild-type mice. Changes in gene expression were more numerous in MDX mice, including genes involved in cell adhesion, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton organization, inflammatory and immune response and cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Dystrophin deficiency facilitates the development and progression of doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. The underlying mechanisms may involve changes in cell adhesion, in cytoskeleton, as well as in inflammatory and immune responses. Genetic variants of cytoskeletal proteins in humans may affect the individual susceptibility to doxorubicin.

The cleavage reaction requires cleavage factors I and II (CF I and CF II), whereas polyadenylation involves CF I, polyadenylation factor I (PFI), and poly(A) polymerase (Pap1p). CF I has recently been separated into two factors, CF IA and CF IB. We have independently purified CF IA and found that five polypeptides cofractionate with the activity. They include Rna14p, Rna15p, Pcf11p, a new protein called Clp1p, and remarkably, the major poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p. Extracts from strains where the PAB1 gene is mutated or deleted are active for cleavage but generate transcripts bearing abnormally long poly(A) tracts. Complementation with recombinant Pab1p not only restores the length of the poly(A) tails to normal, but also triggers a poly(A) shortening activity. In addition, a monoclonal Pab1p antibody prevents the formation of poly(A) tails in extracts or in a reconstituted system.

Therefore, patients with psychiatric symptoms are not candidates for this drug. Drug trials of external intrathecal catheters and microinfusion devices demonstrated a 3% risk of meningitis.

However, this finding was not replicated with 55 trios (AN child+parents) and the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). To clarify the role of the 5-HTTLPR in susceptibility to AN, we used the TDT and 106 Australian trios to provide 93% power to detect a genotypic relative risk (GRR) of 2.0. Our results were negative for this GRR (McNemar's chi(2)=0.01, df=1, p=0.921, odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.7-1.5). Additionally, we found no association with AN females, AN subtype, age at onset, or minimum BMI. We then performed the first reported investigation of epistasis between the SERT gene and norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2, alias NET) in AN, as an earlier study suggested that atypical AN responds to the dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. We observed no epistasis between the 5-HTTLPR and a polymorphism within the NET gene promoter polymorphic region (NETpPR) (chi(2)=0.48, df=1, p=0.490). Although 5-HTTLPR modulates serotonin reuptake by the serotonin transporter, our analyses provide no evidence that susceptibility to AN is modified by 5-HTTLPR alone, nor in concert with as yet undetermined functional effects of the NETpPR polymorphism.",

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) do not have to be administered continuously to be effective for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), but can be given during luteal phases only. This is of practical importance, but also of theoretical interest since it suggests that the onset of action of SRIs is shorter in PMDD than in, for example depression. In this study, both continuous and intermittent SRI administration was compared with placebo, with the special purpose of analyzing if different PMDD symptoms respond differently depending on the treatment regimen. To this end, women meeting slightly modified DSM-IV criteria for PMDD (mean+/-SD age, 37+/-6.3 years) were treated for three menstrual cycles with paroxetine continuously, paroxetine during the luteal phase only, or placebo, the population completing at least one treatment cycle comprising 55-56 subjects per group. Continuous treatment with paroxetine reduced premenstrual symptoms effectively with a response rate of 85%. The effect size was highest for irritability (1.4) and lowest for lack of energy (0.5). Intermittent treatment was as effective as continuous treatment in reducing irritability, affect lability, and mood swings, but had a somewhat weaker effect on depressed mood and somatic symptoms. The study indicates that the response rate when treating PMDD with SRIs is high, and that irritability is a key target symptom. Symptoms such as irritability, affect lability, and mood swings appear to be more inclined to respond rapidly to SRIs, enabling intermittent treatment, than are, for example, the somatic symptoms.",

Surface glycosylation profiling by flow cytometry and lectin microarray was applied to uEVs enriched from urine of healthy adults by ultracentrifugation and centrifugal filtration. The carbohydrate specificity of lectin microarray profiles was confirmed by competitive sugar inhibition and carbohydrate-specific enzyme hydrolysis. Glycosylation profiles of uEVs and purified Tamm Horsfall protein were compared. In both flow cytometry and lectin microarray assays, uEVs demonstrated surface binding, at low to moderate intensities, of a broad range of lectins whether prepared by ultracentrifugation or centrifugal filtration. In general, ultracentrifugation-prepared uEVs demonstrated higher lectin binding intensities than centrifugal filtration-prepared uEVs consistent with lesser amounts of co-purified non-vesicular proteins. The surface glycosylation profiles of uEVs showed little inter-individual variation and were distinct from those of Tamm Horsfall protein, which bound a limited number of lectins. In a pilot study, lectin microarray was used to compare uEVs from individuals with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease to those of age-matched controls. The lectin microarray profiles of polycystic kidney disease and healthy uEVs showed differences in binding intensity of 6/43 lectins.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are common clinical conditions that negatively impact health-related quality of life and are linked to serious medical comorbidities. Disease mechanisms involve local and systemic chronic inflammatory processes. Available biologic therapies specifically target single inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), in the context of a larger inflammatory signaling cascade. To interrupt this pathological cascade earlier in the response or further upstream, and return pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling to a homeostatic balance, the use of a phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) inhibitor has been explored. PDE4 is the major enzyme class responsible for the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular second messenger that controls a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. With PDE4 inhibition, and the resulting increases in cAMP levels in immune and non-immune cell types, expression of a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators can be modulated. Apremilast is an orally available targeted PDE4 inhibitor that modulates a wide array of inflammatory mediators involved in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, including decreases in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, TNF-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-23 and increases IL-10. In phase II studies of subjects with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, apremilast reversed features of the inflammatory pathophysiology in skin and joints and significantly reduces clinical symptoms. The use of an oral targeted PDE4 inhibitor for chronic inflammatory diseases, like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, represents a novel treatment approach that does not target any single mediator, but rather focuses on restoring a balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals.",

Maternal peripheral insulin resistance and increased inflammation are two features of pregnancies, complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

The aim of this study was to determine whether levels of NOD1 and NOD2 are increased in adipose tissue of women with GDM. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. NOD1, but not NOD2, expression was higher in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues obtained from women with GDM when compared with those from women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). In both omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues from NGT and GDM women, the NOD1 ligand g-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) significantly induced the expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) and chemokine IL8; COX2 (PTGS2) gene expression and subsequent prostaglandin production; the expression and secretion of the extracellular matrix remodelling enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and the gene expression and secretion of the adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1. There was no effect of the NOD2 ligand muramyl dipeptide on any of the endpoints tested. The effects of the NOD1 ligand iE-DAP were mediated via NF\u03baB, as the NF\u03baB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 significantly attenuated iE-DAP-induced expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX2 gene expression and subsequent prostaglandin production, MMP9 expression and secretion and ICAM1 and VCAM1 gene expression and secretion.

The median follow-up period was 27 months (range: 3-107). RESULTS: At the end of operation a complete cytoreduction (CCR-0) was obtained in 37 patients (70%). Major morbidity occurred in 12 patients (23%); reoperation was necessary in 2 patients (4%), and no postoperative mortality was observed. Overall 5-year survival probability was 55%; it was 71% in CCR-0, 44% in CCR-1, and none in patients with CCR-2 or CCR-3 residual tumor (log-rank test: P = 0.017). The cumulative risk of recurrence in 37 CCR-0 cases was 54% at 5 years from operation.

During differentiation of embryonic stem cells, chromatin reorganizes to establish cell type-specific expression programs. Here, we have dissected the linkages between DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC), nucleosome repositioning, and binding of the transcription factor CTCF during this process. By integrating MNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated counterparts with biophysical modeling, we found that the interplay between these factors depends on their genomic context. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. The few remaining methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferentially associated with nucleosomes. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state.",

BACKGROUND: The serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency has long been suspected as a risk factor for glucose intolerance and perhaps 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has a role in the regulation of insulin secretion. This study investigates the relation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and insulin resistance in pregnant women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 741 pregnant women referred to five educating hospital clinics. Universal screening was performed with a GCT-50 g, and those with plasma glucose levels > pr = 7.2 mmol/L were diagnosed as GDM if they had an impaired GTT-100 g based on Carpenter and Coustan criteria. The levels of insulin and C-peptide were measured during OGTT-100 g test. The homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA) equation was used as the insulin resistance index. The concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and PTH were also measured. RESULTS: Total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was found in 70.6% of pregnant women. Prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency (<12.5) in GDM patients was higher than in normoglycaemic pregnancies. The regression model revealed a strong correlation between the HOMA index and serum levels of vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a positive correlation of 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations with insulin sensitivity and vitamin D deficiency could be a confirmative sign of insulin resistance.",

BACKGROUND: Genome amplification through duplication or proliferation of transposable elements has its counterpart in genome reduction, by elimination of DNA or by gene inactivation. Whether loss is primarily due to excision of random length DNA fragments or the inactivation of one gene at a time is controversial. Reduction after whole genome duplication (WGD) represents an inexorable collapse in gene complement. RESULTS: We compare fifteen genomes descending from six eukaryotic WGD events 20-450 Mya. We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. Descendant genomes of the same WGD event behave as replicates. Choice of paralog pairs to be reduced is random except for some resistant regions of contiguous pairs. For those paralog pairs that are reduced, conserved copies tend to concentrate on one chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: Both the contiguous regions of reduction-resistant pairs and the concentration of runs of single copy genes on a single chromosome are evidence of transcriptional co-regulation, dosage sensitivity or other functional interaction constraining the reduction process. These constraints and their evolution over time show a consistent pattern across evolutionary domains and a highly reproducible pattern, as replicates, for the several descendants of a single WGD.",

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires for its treatment permanent dialysis or kidney transplantation (KT). KT is the best clinical treatment, however, the early function of the allograft varies depending on multiple factors associated with cold ischemia time (CIT) and the allograft rejection process. It is known that serum creatinine is an insensitive and late marker for predicting graft recovery after KT, mainly in patients with delayed graft function (DGF). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is produced in the distal nephron and it is one of the most promising novel biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). NGAL has been proposed to be a predictor of organ recovery from DGF after KT from donors after cardiac death. Because nonrenal diseases can also induce NGAL, more information is necessary to validate the sensitivity and specificity of urine and plasma NGAL in clinical samples. The exosomes are vesicles released into the urine from the kidney epithelium and they have been proposed as better source to explore as biomarker of renal dysfunction. The molecular composition of the urinary exosomes could be representative of the physiological or physiopathologic condition of the urinary system. We propose that determination of NGAL in urinary exosomes is a better predictor of kidney dysfunction after KT than other urinary fractions. We analyzed 15 kidney allograft recipients, with a mean age of 36 years (range, 16-60 years) and 75% were male: 11 living donors (LD) and 4 deceased donors (DD). The average length of CIT was 14 hours in DD and less than 1 hour in LD. Three patient developed DGF. Using Western blot analysis, NGAL was detectable in the cellular and exosomal fraction of the urine. The exosomes expressed higher levels of NGAL than the cellular fraction. The expression of NGAL was observed from the first day after transplantation. In the cellular fraction of the urine, no significant differences of NGAL were observed between the patients. However, the median of NGAL expression in the exosomes fraction was significantly higher in DD patient, from the first day after KT (P < .05). Moreover, we noticed that NGAL expression in exosomes remained elevated in the patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients (P < .05). Considering the highest abundance of NGAL in the urinary exosomes and its correlation with DGF patients, we suggest the exosomal fraction as a more sensitive substrate to evaluate early biomarkers of DGF after KT.",

Here we have studied topoisomerase II trapping and DNA synthesis patterns in relation to the acute cytotoxic actions of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (mAMSA) or mitoxantrone on SV40 transformed human fibroblasts. These two DNA intercalators differed significantly in their cytotoxic potential, mitoxantrone being 24-fold more toxic than mAMSA when assayed by the inhibition of clonogenicity. Although both drugs induced G2 delay at cytotoxic concentrations, mAMSA-treated cells recovered normal cell cycle phase distributions within 24 h of removal of drug, while mitoxantrone-treated cells continued to accumulate in G2 up to 48 h following drug treatment with evidence of complete inhibition of entry into mitosis. Compared with mAMSA, mitoxantrone showed a similar capacity to induce cleavable complexes in cellular DNA, and only a 2-fold greater ability to inhibit DNA synthesis. Within a 4-h posttreatment period, mAMSA-treated cells recovered normal rates of DNA synthesis, whereas a continued depression of DNA synthesis was observed in mitoxantrone-treated cells. The recovery patterns of DNA synthesis correlated with the rapid disappearance of mAMSA-induced complexes (less than 27% lesions remaining 2 h after drug removal) and the persistence of mitoxantrone-induced complexes during a 4-h posttreatment period. This difference in complex longevity was observed in other human transformed fibroblast cell lines irrespective of differences in the absolute levels of complexes induced by either agent. We suggest that the results provide evidence that DNA intercalators may differ in the forms of complexes induced and that the comparatively high cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone relates to the ability of the drug to trap topoisomerase II complexes in a form which effects a long-term inhibition of DNA replication and G2 traverse.",

The effects of the Ca(2+) load on Ca(2+) release through RyR2 are facilitated by: (i) the sensitivity of RyR2 itself to luminal Ca(2+) concentrations; and (ii) interactions between the cardiac Ca(2+) -binding protein calsequestrin (CSQ) 2 and RyR2, transmitted through the 'anchoring' proteins junctin and/or triadin.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. The majority of OI cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen. OI cases of autosomal recessive inheritance are rare, and OI type XI is attributable to mutation of the FKBP10 gene. Here, we used next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing to detect mutations in FKBP10 and to analyze their relation to the phenotypes of OI type XI in three Chinese patients. We also evaluated the efficacy of zoledronic acid treatment in these patients. Two of the affected patients had novel compound heterozygous mutations, one patient with c.343C>T (p.R115X) in exon 2 and c.1085delC (p.A362fsX1) in exon 7, and the other patient with c.879C>G (p.Y293X) in exon 5 and c.918-3C>G in intron 5. In the third proband, we identified a homozygous single base-pair duplication, c.831dupC (p.G278RfsX95) in exon 5. In conclusion, we report for the first time that these novel pathogenic mutations of FKBP10 can lead to the extremely rare type XI OI without contractures, which expands the genotypic spectrum of OI. The phenotypes of these patients are similar to patients with types III or IV OI, and zoledronic acid is effective in increasing BMD, inhibiting bone resorption biomarkers and reducing fractures of these patients.",

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods have seen significant improvement since their inception in the late 1950s.

With newer techniques and hardware available, MD simulations of more biologically relevant timescales can now sample a broader range of conformational and dynamical changes including rare events. One concern in the literature has been under which circumstances it is sufficient to perform many shorter timescale simulations and under which circumstances fewer longer simulations are necessary.

OBJECTIVE: In the white population, an association between oculo(dermal) melanocytosis (ODM) and uveal melanoma is well recognized. However, the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma in the ODM population is not known. This study was designed to determine the lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma among patients with ocular melanocytosis. DESIGN: Fifty-six white patients manifesting ODM with uveal melanoma formed the basis of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Published prevalence rates of ODM and uveal melanoma were used for calculations using Bayes' theorem. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of uveal melanoma in white patients with ODM is estimated to be 2.6 x 10(-3). The median age at diagnosis of uveal melanoma in the ODM population was similar to a randomly selected population (60.5 years and 62.5 years, respectively). In the vast majority of patients (90%) with ODM-associated uveal melanoma, the uveal melanoma was diagnosed between the ages of 31 years and 80 years. CONCLUSIONS: One of about 400 patients with ODM followed for life is estimated to develop uveal melanoma. Excessive melanocytes in the uveal tract in ODM may provide the biologic basis for susceptibility to the development of uveal melanoma. Patients with ODM should be monitored ophthalmoscopically, especially during the susceptible period, for the development of uveal melanoma. The authors suggest that a national registry of ODM patients be created and prospective data collected to better assess the risk of developing uveal melanoma.",

OBJECTIVES: The model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 11.2*[PT-INR] + 6.4) predicts mortality for tricuspid valve surgery. However, the MELD is problematic in patients undergoing warfarin therapy, as warfarin affects the international normalized ratio (INR). This study aimed to determine whether a simplified MELD score that does not require the INR for calculation could predict mortality for patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery. Simplified MELD score = 3.8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9.6*LN[creatinine] + 6.4. METHODS: A total of 172 patients (male: 66, female: 106; mean age, 63.8 \u00b1 10.3 years) who underwent tricuspid replacement (n = 18) or repair (n = 154) from January 1991 to July 2011 at a single centre were included. Of them, 168 patients in whom the simplified MELD score could be calculated were retrospectively analysed. The relationship between in-hospital mortality and perioperative variables was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The rate of in-hospital mortality was 6.4%. The mean admission simplified MELD score for the patients who died was significantly higher than for those surviving beyond discharge (11.3 \u00b1 4.1 vs 5.8 \u00b1 4.0; P = 0.001). By multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality included higher simplified MELD score (P = 0.001) and tricuspid valve replacement (P = 0.023). In-hospital mortality and morbidity increased along with increasing simplified MELD score. Scores <0, 0-6.9, 7-13.9 and >14 were associated with mortalities of 0, 2.0, 8.3 and 66.7%, respectively. The incidence of serious complications (multiple organ failure, P = 0.005; prolonged ventilation, P = 0.01; need for haemodialysis; P = 0.002) was also significantly higher in patients with simplified MELD score > 7.

METHODS: Cases (n = 75) had a postdeployment diagnosis of PTSD. Controls (n = 75) were randomly selected service members with no postdeployment PTSD diagnosis. Pre- and post-deployment sera were accessed, DNA was extracted and DNA methylation (percentage 5-methyl cytosine) was quantified via pyrosequencing.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) due to mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is reported in 5-10% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) complicating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The molecular mechanisms underlying MMR deficiency may be different in IBD CRCs, and in sporadic and hereditary MSI tumors. Here, we hypothesize that overexpression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related microRNAs that target core MMR proteins, may constitute a pre-neoplastic event for the development of MSI IBD CRCs. We studied miR-155 and miR-21 expression using real-time quantitative PCR in MSI (n = 10) and microsatellite stable (n = 10) IBD CRCs, and in MSI (n = 32) and microsatellite stable (n = 30) non-IBD CRCs. We also screened colonic samples from IBD patients without cancer (n = 18) and used healthy colonic mucosa as controls (n = 20). MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly overexpressed not only in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared with non-IBD controls (P < 0.001). Importantly, in patients with IBD CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 overexpression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (P < 0.001). Ratios of expressions in tumors versus matched distant mucosa revealed a nearly significant association between miR-155 overexpression and MSI in IBDs (P = 0.057). These results show a strong deregulation of both MMR-targeting microRNAs in IBD subjects with or without cancer. MiR-155 overexpression being particularly associated to MSI IBD CRCs and extending to distant non-neoplastic mucosa, strongly suggests that a pre-neoplastic miR-155 field defect may promote MSI-driven transformation of the colonic mucosa. The detection and monitoring of miR-155 field defect may, therefore, have implications for the prevention and treatment of MSI IBD CRCs.",

C. elegans provides an excellent model system for the study of the Fanconi Anemia (FA), one of the hallmarks of which is sensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents. Central to our understanding of FA has been the investigation of DOG-1, the functional ortholog of the deadbox helicase FANCJ. Here we review the current understanding of the unique role of DOG-1 in maintaining stability of G-rich DNA in C. elegans and explore the question of why DOG-1 animals are crosslink sensitive. We propose a dynamic model in which noncovalently linked G-rich structures form and un-form in the presence of DOG-1. When DOG-1 is absent but crosslinking agents are present the G-rich structures are readily covalently crosslinked, resulting in increased crosslinks formation and thus giving increased crosslink sensitivity. In this interpretation DOG-1 is neither upstream nor downstream in the FA pathway, but works alongside it to limit the availability of crosslink substrates. This model reconciles the crosslink sensitivity observed in the absence of DOG-1 function with its unique role in maintaining G-Rich DNA and will help to formulate experiments to test this hypothesis.",

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer associated (BRCA) genes are critical for DNA repair. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCAm) result in loss of these repair mechanisms and potential carcinogenesis. Germline BRCAm are common in ovarian carcinomas, particularly in platinum-sensitive disease. The increased prevalence of BRCAm in platinum-sensitive disease is likely due to enhanced responsiveness to platinum chemotherapy from homologous recombination repair deficiency. The purpose of this study was to explore BRCA testing, treatment patterns and survival in platinum-sensitive recurrent (PSR) ovarian cancer. METHODS: This was an observational cohort analysis of PSR ovarian cancer treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute from 1995 to 2012. Germline BRCA status was ascertained through chart review and categorized as BRCAm (BRCA1/2 positive), BRCAwt (BRCA wild type or variant of uncertain significance), and untested. Treatment patterns and survival were assessed from recurrence until death or last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate survival from recurrence by BRCA status. Logistic regression and COX proportional hazard model was used to estimate predictors of BRCA testing and survival, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 168 PSR patients, 15 (9 %) were BRCAm, 25 (15 %) were BRCAwt, and 128 (76 %) were untested. Median age at PSR was 56 years for BRCAm and BRCAwt (p = 0.90) and 63 years for those untested (p = 0.033 vs BRCAm). Overall survival was similar between BRCAm and BRCAwt (median 50.4 vs 67.5 months, p = 0.86) and was 24.9 months in untested patients. Significant predictors for the likelihood of BRCA testing were age (OR = 0.93, 95 % CI 0.89, 0.97, p = 0.002), family history of breast or ovarian cancer (OR = 8.33, 95 % CI: 3.08, 22.59, p < 0.001), and cancer diagnosis year (OR = 10.02, 95 % CI: 3.22, 31.21, p < 0.001). BRCA-tested patients had a lower risk of death versus untested (HR 0.35, 95 % CI 0.17, 0.68, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BRCAwt patients had similar outcomes to BRCAm patients, potentially owing to similar age at diagnosis, representing a BRCA testing channeling bias. Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. BRCA tested patients had a lower risk of death.",

Bruxism is a pathological activity of the stomatognathic system that involves tooth grinding and clenching during parafunctional jaw movements. Clinical signs of bruxism are mostly related to dental wear and muscular and joint discomforts, but a large number of etiological factors can be listed, as local, systemic, psychological and hereditary factors. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes. From the diagnosis, a multidisciplinary treatment plan was established. The initial treatment approach consisted of medical follow up with counseling on diet and smoking habits and management of the gastric disorders. This was followed by the installation of an interocclusal acrylic device in centric relation of occlusion (CRO) for reestablishment of the occlusal stability, vertical dimension of occlusion, anterior guides and return to normal muscle activity (90-day use approximately). After remission of initial symptoms, oral rehabilitation was implemented in CRO by means of full resin composite restorations and new interocclusal device for protection of restorations. Satisfactory esthetics, improved function and occlusal stability were obtained after oral rehabilitation. The patient has attended annual follow-ups for the past 2 years.

Bone union, volar tilt, radial inclination, radial height, range of motion, grip strength, and any complications were assessed by a single hand surgeon. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 17 (range, 14-25) months, the mean palmar flexion was 49\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-80\u00ba), dorsiflexion was 52\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-80\u00ba), supination was 86\u00ba (range, 60\u00ba-90\u00ba), pronation was 77\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-90\u00ba), radial deviation was 16\u00ba (range, 5\u00ba-30\u00ba), and ulnar deviation was 27\u00ba (range, 10\u00ba-50\u00ba). The mean grip strength of the injured hand was 69.2% of the uninjured side. The mean time to radiological union was 3.9 (range, 2.5-6.0) months; no patient had non-union. At the time of union, the mean volar tilt was 5\u00ba (-22\u00ba-14\u00ba), radial inclination was 18.6\u00ba (8\u00ba-28\u00ba), and radial height was 8.5 mm (5.0 mm-13.6 mm). One patient had collapse of the dorsal fragment resulting in a dorsal tilt of 22\u00ba and limited (30\u00ba) forearm pronation. The severity of dorsal metaphyseal comminution had not been recognised and bone grafting was not performed. The patient also had minor complications of little finger flexor tendon irritation and carpal tunnel syndrome. She underwent implant removal and carpal tunnel release at 8 months. One patient had implant-related extensor digitorum communis irritation. Another patient had non-specific chronic wrist pain, which was resolved at one year.

Knockdown of eRNAs expressed at neuronal enhancers impairs transient release of NELF from the specific target promoters during transcriptional activation, coinciding with a decrease in target mRNA induction. The enhancer-promoter interaction was unaffected by eRNA knockdown. Instead, chromatin looping might enable eRNAs to act locally at a specific promoter. Our findings highlight the spatiotemporally regulated action mechanism of eRNAs during early transcriptional elongation.",

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. To explore its mode of action, nintedanib was tested in human lung fibroblasts and mouse models of lung fibrosis. Human lung fibroblasts expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor BB (homodimer) (PDGF-BB). Receptor activation was assessed by autophosphorylation and cell proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2)-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation was determined by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) mRNA analysis. Lung fibrosis was induced in mice by intratracheal bleomycin or silica particle administration. Nintedanib was administered every day by gavage at 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg. Preventive nintedanib treatment regimen started on the day that bleomycin was administered. Therapeutic treatment regimen started at various times after the induction of lung fibrosis. Bleomycin caused increased macrophages and lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and elevated interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and collagen in lung tissue. Histology revealed chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Silica-induced lung pathology additionally showed elevated BAL neutrophils, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) levels, and granuloma formation. Nintedanib inhibited PDGF receptor activation, fibroblast proliferation, and fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation. Nintedanib significantly reduced BAL lymphocytes and neutrophils but not macrophages. Furthermore, interleukin-1\u03b2, KC, TIMP-1, and lung collagen were significantly reduced. Histologic analysis showed significantly diminished lung inflammation, granuloma formation, and fibrosis. The therapeutic effect was dependent on treatment start and duration. Nintedanib inhibited receptor tyrosine kinase activation and the proliferation and transformation of human lung fibroblasts and showed antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in two animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",

Modafinil (2-[(Diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide, Provigil) is an FDA-approved medication with wake-promoting properties. Pre-clinical studies of modafinil suggest a complex profile of neurochemical and behavioral effects, distinct from those of amphetamine. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction may be a particularly important emerging treatment target for modafinil, across these and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed to comprehensively review the empirical literature on neurochemical actions of modafinil, and effects on cognition in animal models, healthy adult humans, and clinical populations. We searched PubMed with the search term 'modafinil' and reviewed all English-language articles for neurochemical, neurophysiological, cognitive, or information-processing experimental measures. We additionally summarized the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil and clinical efficacy in psychiatric patients. Modafinil exhibits robust effects on catecholamines, serotonin, glutamate, gamma amino-butyric acid, orexin, and histamine systems in the brain. Many of these effects may be secondary to catecholamine effects, with some selectivity for cortical over subcortical sites of action. In addition, modafinil (at well-tolerated doses) improves function in several cognitive domains, including working memory and episodic memory, and other processes dependent on prefrontal cortex and cognitive control. These effects are observed in rodents, healthy adults, and across several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, modafinil appears to be well-tolerated, with a low rate of adverse events and a low liability to abuse. Modafinil has a number of neurochemical actions in the brain, which may be related to primary effects on catecholaminergic systems. These effects are in general advantageous for cognitive processes. Overall, modafinil is an excellent candidate agent for remediation of cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Notably, NEMO was not recruited into the TNFR1 complex of DM cells, and consequently NF-\u03baB induction by TNF was severely impaired and DM cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell death. Interestingly, the TNF signaling defects can be fully rescued by reconstitution of DM cells with CYLD lacking ubiquitin hydrolase activity but not with CYLD mutated in TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) or NEMO binding sites.

Elevated serum bilirubin levels are caused mainly by liver diseases, haematolysis, genetic defects and drug intake.

The present study was performed to determine the association between SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms and serum bilirubin levels in vivo. Moreover, the effects of administration of low-dose rifampicin on serum bilirubin levels in different SLCO1B1 genotypes was examined. 2. Serum bilirubin levels were examined in 42 healthy volunteers who had been analysed for SLCO1B1 genotype (seven, 13, 14 and eight with SLCO1B1 genotypes *1a/*1a, *1b/*1b, *1b/*15 and *15/*15, respectively). Among them, 24 subjects (seven, seven, eight and two with SLCO1B1 genotypes *1a/*1a, *1b/*1b, *1b/*15 and *15/*15, respectively) were selected to participate in an open-label, two-phase clinical trial. Each was given 450 mg rifampicin orally once daily at 2000 hours for 5 consecutive days. Serum bilirubin concentrations at 0800 hours on the 1st and 6th days were compared between the different SLCO1B1 genotypes. 3.

Aberrant expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been reported to be involved in the development and progression of various types of cancers. However, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of miR-146a to various aspects of the malignant phenotype of human NSCLCs. In functional experiments, miR-146a suppressed cell growth, induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited EGFR downstream signaling in five NSCLC cell lines (H358, H1650, H1975, HCC827 and H292). miR-146a also inhibited the migratory capacity of these NSCLC cells. On the other hand, miR-146a enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by drugs targeting EGFR, including both TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) and a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab). These effects were independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild type, sensitizing mutation or resistance mutation), but were less potent compared to the effects of siRNA targeting of EGFR. Our results suggest that these effects of miR-146a are due to its targeting of EGFR and NF-\u03baB signaling. We also found, in clinical formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) lung cancer samples, that low expression of miR-146a was correlated with advanced clinical TNM stages and distant metastasis in NSCLC (P<0.05). The patients with high miR-146a expression in their tumors showed longer progression-free survival (25.6 weeks in miR-146a high patients vs. 4.8 weeks in miR-146a low patients, P<0.05). miR-146a is therefore a strong candidate prognostic biomarker in NSCLC.

Eighty-six workers exposed to zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) pesticide were studied for evidence of neuropsychiatric manifestations.

All were males (mean age, 35.8 years; mean duration of exposure to zinc phosphide, 11.3 years). Most presented with one (or more) neuropsychiatric symptom(s), including fear of poisoning, anxiety, impotence, and easy fatigue. About half showed evidence of neuropsychiatric signs, including hyperreflexia, polyneuropathy, lumber radiculopathy, and cervical myelopathy, as well as anxious mood, impaired attention, and psychomotor stimulation. EEG recordings showed abnormal findings in 17.4% of the subjects. The mean age in that group was 39.1 years; mean duration of exposure to Zn3P2 was 15.1 years. EMG studies showed evidence of partial denervation of the anterior tibial group of muscles and flexor digiti minimi in 2 of the 30 workers (6.7%) who underwent EMG examination. Serum levels of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Ca) were significantly higher in exposed workers than in controls (P < 0.005). Serum copper (Cu), iron (Fe), phosphorus (P), and magnesium (Mg) were significantly lower in exposed workers than in controls. Electrophoretic pattern of globulin showed that gammaglobulin fraction was significantly increased (P < 0.005); alpha2 and beta-globulin were decreased (P < 0.005) in exposed workers. Lipoprotein pattern showed that the total lipids, B-lipoprotein, and B/alpha ratio were significantly increased (P < 0.005) in exposed workers; the alpha1 lipoprotein was decreased. Triglycerides and cholesterol were significantly increased (P < 0.001), and phospholipids and phospholipid/cholesterol ratio were significantly decreased (P < 0.005) in exposed workers compared to controls.

The correlation and the concordance with the inulin clearance of each method of renal function evaluation were assessed. RESULTS: The correlation of serum creatinine with inulin clearance was low when using serum creatinine-based equations such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (simplified and complete) and Cockcroft-Gault equations. The r and r(2) coefficients were higher for creatinine-based methods, such as 24-hour (r = 0.72) and 3-hour creatinine clearance (r = 0.78). The strongest correlation was found for serum cystatin C-based equations: the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine/cystatin C combined equation (r = 0.78) and the CKD-EPI cystatin C equation (r = 0.80). Mean bias of serum creatinine-based equations estimating glomerular filtration rate, the Cockcroft-Gault, and the simplified and complete Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations, was 27.5 \u00b1 28.6, 17.48 \u00b1 29.40, and 21.98 \u00b1 30.40 mL/min, respectively.

Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a severe intellectual disability (ID)-distinctive facial gestalt-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, commonly associating microcephaly, epilepsy, corpus callosum agenesis, conotruncal heart defects, urogenital malformations and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations lead to haplo-insufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of which resides in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. Patients' phenotype included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, heart defects or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all the three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Taking advantage of the zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent, embryo rescue, correlating with the severity of patients' phenotype, was observed. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.",

The risk of seizures varies between 60% and 100% among low-grade gliomas and between 40% and 60% in glioblastomas. The presence of seizures in patients with brain tumors implies favorable and unfavorable factors. New-onset seizures represent an early warning sign for the presence of a brain tumor and count as a good prognostic factor for survival. Recurrence or worsening of seizures during the course of disease may signal tumor progression. Each of the modalities for tumor control (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) contributes to seizure control. Nevertheless, one third of BTE shows pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and may severely impair the burden of living with a brain tumor. For symptomatic therapy of BTE, seizure type and individual patient factors determine the appropriate AED. Randomized controlled trials in partial epilepsy in adults to which type BTE belongs and additional studies in gliomas indicate that levetiracetam is the agent of choice, followed by valproic acid (VPA). In the case of recurring seizures, combining these two drugs (polytherapy) seems effective and possibly synergistic. If either one is not effective or not well tolerated, lacosamide, lamotrigine, or zonisamide are additional options. A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.

The balanced growth of a cell requires the integration of major systems such as DNA replication, membrane biosynthesis, and ribosome formation. An example of such integration is evident from our recent finding that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, any failure in the secretory pathway leads to severe repression of transcription of both rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. We have attempted to determine the regulatory circuit(s) that connects the secretory pathway with the transcription of ribosomal genes. Experiments show that repression does not occur through the circuit that responds to misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, nor does it occur through circuits known to regulate ribosome synthesis, e.g. the stringent response, or the cAMP pathway. Rather, it appears to depend on a stress response at the plasma membrane that is transduced through protein kinase C (PKC). Deletion of PKC1 relieves the repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes that occurs in response to a defect in the secretory pathway. We propose that failure of the secretory pathway prevents the synthesis of new plasma membrane. As protein synthesis continues, stress develops in the plasma membrane. This stress is monitored by Pkc1p, which initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to repression of transcription of the rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. The importance of the transcription of the 137 ribosomal protein genes to the economy of the cell is apparent from the existence of at least three distinct pathways that can effect the repression of this set of genes.",

TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules. Although TDP-43 has been shown to interact with translation factors, its role in protein synthesis remains unclear, and no in vivo translation targets have been reported to date. Here we provide evidence that TDP-43 associates with futsch mRNA in a complex and regulates its expression at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. In the context of TDP-43-induced proteinopathy, there is a significant reduction of futsch mRNA at the NMJ compared with motor neuron cell bodies where we find higher levels of transcript compared with controls. TDP-43 also leads to a significant reduction in Futsch protein expression at the NMJ. Polysome fractionations coupled with quantitative PCR experiments indicate that TDP-43 leads to a futsch mRNA shift from actively translating polysomes to nontranslating ribonuclear protein particles, suggesting that in addition to its effect on localization, TDP-43 also regulates the translation of futsch mRNA. We also show that futsch overexpression is neuroprotective by extending life span, reducing TDP-43 aggregation, and suppressing ALS-like locomotor dysfunction as well as NMJ abnormalities linked to microtubule and synaptic stabilization. Furthermore, the localization of MAP1B, the mammalian homolog of Futsch, is altered in ALS spinal cords in a manner similar to our observations in Drosophila motor neurons. Together, our results suggest a microtubule-dependent mechanism in motor neuron disease caused by TDP-43-dependent alterations in futsch mRNA localization and translation in vivo.",

In the first part of this study, the effect of four isocaloric mixed breakfast meals on the blood glucose and urinary glucose losses was tested in nine adult diabetics and in three healthy subjects, ages 60 to 75. Three of the test meals consisted of a base diet supplemented with applesauce sweetened with sucrose, fructose, or sorbitol. In the fourth test meal, the starch was increased together with saccharine. In the second part of the study, analyses for free glucose and sucrose in several timed food preparations, ordinary as well as food preparations specially designed for diabetics, were performed. The amount of sucrose equivalents (S(eg)) in one ordinary serving of the various products was estimated. No significant differences among sucrose, fructose, and sorbitol-containing meals with respect to the effect on the blood glucose level or on glucosuria were found. The saccharine-containing meal gave a significantly greater blood glucose increase at 60 min only. The amount of sucrose in ordinary marinated foods, such as herring, cucumber, and common beet was negligible. Water-packed fruits supplied one half of the amount of S(eq) or less, compared with fruits packed in sorbitol-sweetened syrup. The amount of S(eq) in the latter products as well as in fruits packed in unsweetened juice equalled that of the fleshy substance of ordinary sucrose-sweetened products. It was concluded that fructose or sorbitol has no advantages over sucrose, as regards the effect on blood glucose in well-regulated adult diabetics, and that it seems unnecessary to have specially sweetened foods designed for diabetics.",

OBJECTIVE: To update and expand the previous position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. RESULTS: Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking. Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data to confirm the safety of local estrogen in women with breast cancer; management of VVA should take the woman's needs and the recommendation of her oncologist into consideration. Research on the vaginal microbiome may lead to other therapies in the future.",

BACKGROUND: Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. While cytoplasmic HuR expression was identified as a marker in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of several types of cancer, its role in diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains unclear. METHODS: Renal biopsies from Type 2 diabetic patients and STZ-induced DN rats were stained for HuR and EMT markers. Redistribution of HuR was detected by immunostaining and western blot in high glucose stimulated cells. RNAi was used to supress HuR expression. The binding affinity for EMT-related genes was evaluated by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic HuR expression was elevated in human and rat DN specimens along with EMT changes compared to normal controls. HuR shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm facilitated epithelial to mesenchymal transition in renal epithelial cells. The suppression of HuR partially inhibited EMT of high glucose stimulated HK-2 cells. Furthermore, HuR bound to 3'-UTRs of critical cytokines or transcription factors mRNA involved in EMT process. CONCLUSION: Acquired phenotypic traits of EMT were partially through the enhanced HuR-binding proteins and its post-transcriptional regulation role in DN.",

Intronic RNAs were abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing.

PURPOSE: Efficacy and acute toxicity of proton craniospinal irradiation (p-CSI) were compared with conventional photon CSI (x-CSI) for adults with medulloblastoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty adult medulloblastoma patients treated with x-CSI (n=21) or p-CSI (n=19) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2003 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Median CSI and total doses were 30.6 and 54 Gy, respectively. The median follow-up was 57 months (range 4-103) for x-CSI patients and 26 months (range 11-63) for p-CSI. RESULTS: p-CSI patients lost less weight than x-CSI patients (1.2% vs 5.8%; P=.004), and less p-CSI patients had >5% weight loss compared with x-CSI (16% vs 64%; P=.004). p-CSI patients experienced less grade 2 nausea and vomiting compared with x-CSI (26% vs 71%; P=.004). Patients treated with x-CSI were more likely to have medical management of esophagitis than p-CSI patients (57% vs 5%, P<.001). p-CSI patients had a smaller reduction in peripheral white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets compared with x-CSI (white blood cells 46% vs 55%, P=.04; hemoglobin 88% vs 97%, P=.009; platelets 48% vs 65%, P=.05).

BACKGROUND: Vesicular dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema is a common disorder but treatment is difficult. Localized photochemotherapy (cream psoralen-UVA [PUVA]) has widely been used for therapy. Although the efficacy of cream PUVA therapy is well known, potential side effects may occur. Therefore, a more standardized safe and effective UV therapy should be carried out. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of localized high-dose UVA1 irradiation versus topical cream PUVA for treatment of chronic vesicular dyshidrotic eczema. METHODS: On the basis of the assessment of the Dyshidrotic Area and Severity Index, the decrease of score points on the UVA1-treated side was compared with the decrease on the cream PUVA-treated side in 27 patients. In addition, analysis of serum markers was performed. RESULTS: Of 27 patients, 24 showed a good response to localized UVA1 irradiation or cream PUVA. Dyshidrotic Area and Severity Index scores significantly decreased on both sides and were reduced to half of the pretreatment values. No statistically significant differences between localized UVA1 irradiation or cream PUVA could be detected.

CXCL7, a chemokine highly expressed in platelets, orchestrates neutrophil recruitment during thrombosis and related pathophysiological processes by interacting with CXCR2 receptor and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAG). CXCL7 exists as monomers and dimers, and dimerization (~50 \u03bcM) and CXCR2 binding (~10 nM) constants indicate that CXCL7 is a potent agonist as a monomer. Currently, nothing is known regarding the structural basis by which receptor and GAG interactions mediate CXCL7 function. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we characterized the binding of CXCL7 monomer to the CXCR2 N-terminal domain (CXCR2Nd) that constitutes a critical docking site and to GAG heparin. We found that CXCR2Nd binds a hydrophobic groove and that ionic interactions also play a role in mediating binding. Heparin binds a set of contiguous basic residues indicating a prominent role for ionic interactions. Modeling studies reveal that the binding interface is dynamic and that GAG adopts different binding geometries. Most importantly, several residues involved in GAG binding are also involved in receptor interactions, suggesting that GAG-bound monomer cannot activate the receptor. Further, this is the first study that describes the structural basis of receptor and GAG interactions of a native monomer of the neutrophil-activating chemokine family.",

BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is a genetic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme \u03b1-galactosidase A (\u03b1-Gal A) which leads to globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) accumulation in multiple tissues. We report on the safety and pharmacodynamics of migalastat hydrochloride, an investigational pharmacological chaperone given orally every other day (QOD) to females with FD. METHODS: This was an open-label, uncontrolled, Phase 2 study of 12 weeks with extension to 48 weeks in nine females with FD. Doses of 50mg, 150 mg and 250 mg were given QOD. At multiple time points, \u03b1-Gal A activity and GL-3 levels were quantified in blood cells, kidney and skin. GL-3 levels were also evaluated through skin and renal histology. Each individual GLA mutation was retrospectively categorized as being amenable or not to migalastat HCl based on an in vitro \u03b1-Gal A transfection assay developed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. RESULTS: Migalastat HCl was generally well tolerated. Patients with amenable mutations seem to demonstrate greater pharmacodynamic response to migalastat HCl compared to patients with non-amenable mutations. The greatest declines in urine GL-3 were observed in the three patients with amenable GLA mutations that were treated with 150 or 250 mg migalastat HCl QOD. Additionally, these three patients all demonstrated decreases in GL-3 inclusions in kidney peri-tubular capillaries. CONCLUSIONS: Migalastat HCl is a candidate oral pharmacological chaperone that provides a potential novel genotype-specific treatment for FD. Treatment resulted in GL-3 substrate decrease in female patients with amenable GLA mutations. Phase 3 studies are ongoing.",

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by extensive hepatic monocyte infiltration and monocyte-derived macrophages have an important role in regulating the disease evolution. However, little is known about the functional changes occurring in liver macrophages during NASH progression. In this study, we investigated phenotypic and functional modifications of hepatic macrophages in experimental NASH induced by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet up to 8weeks. In mice with steatohepatitis liver F4/80-positive macrophages increased in parallel with the disease progression and formed small clusters of enlarged and vacuolated cells. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. Flow cytometry revealed that these enlarged macrophages expressed inflammatory monocyte (CD11b, Ly6C, TNF-\u03b1) markers. However, as compared to regular size macrophages the enlarged sub-set was characterized by an enhanced production of arginase-1 and of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and annexin A1. Similar vacuolated macrophages producing annexin A1 were also evident in liver biopsies of NASH patients. In mice with NASH, the accumulation of enlarged F4/80(+) cells paralleled with a decline in the expression of the macrophage M1 activation markers iNOS, IL-12 and CXCL10, while the levels of M2 polarization markers arginase-1 and MGL-1 were unchanged. Interestingly, the lowering of IL-12 expression mainly involved the macrophage sub-set with regular size. We conclude that during the progression of NASH fat accumulation within liver macrophages promotes the production of anti-inflammatory mediators that influence hepatic inflammatory responses.",

PATIENTS: Individuals with meningioangiomatosis who underwent surgical resection of the lesion. RESULTS: Three patients aged 11, 14, and 32 years (two females, one male) comprise the study. All patients presented with a history of intractable seizures (2, 3, and 30 years duration). None of the patients had von Recklinghausen's disease. All three patients underwent gross total resection of the lesion, and postoperative seizure-free intervals range from 7 to 15 months. Histologically, the lesion is characterized by a proliferation of blood vessels and meningothelial cells arranged around vessels in the meninges, cortex, and underlying white matter. Psammoma body formation or dystrophic mineralization and gliosis of the intervening parenchyma was observed in all three cases.

Access to archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens via shotgun-based proteomic analyses may, therefore, open new avenues for both prospective and retrospective translational research. However, one of the remaining issues in performing comparative proteomic measurements among FFPE tissues relates to potential variability in protein composition and retrieval based on length of storage periods. Optimized protein extraction and digestion procedures for handling FFPE tissues are coupled with the capillary isotachophoresis-based proteome technology to evaluate the effects of length of storage period on archival tissue proteome analysis across 10 archived uterine mesenchymal tumor tissue blocks, including 9 uterine leiomyomas dating from 1990 to 2002 and a single case of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) from 1980. Several statistical measures, including the Pearson correlation coefficient, coefficient of variance, k-means clustering, and ANOVA, are employed to evaluate the possibility of an archival effect on individual proteins or groups of proteins within nine leiomyomas. Low abundance proteins may be more susceptible to the long-term storage as these proteins are more difficult to be retrieved and extracted as the tissue block ages in paraffin. Despite using tissue blocks stored for as many as 28 years, high confidence and comparative proteome analysis between the leiomyomas and the sarcoma is achieved. Though sharing over 1800 common proteins in a core set, a total of 80 proteins unique to the sarcoma are identified distinguishing the ASPS from the leiomyomas. Vacuolar proton translocating ATPase 116 kDa subunit isoform a3, one of the unique proteins expressed in the ASPS, is further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Although IHC is highly sensitive and provides the subcellular resolution, mass spectrometry-based proteome profiling enables global identification and quantification of thousands of proteins without a priori knowledge of individual proteins being analyzed or the need of validated antibodies.",

Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation.

Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. We have now applied the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment protocol to a library of single-stranded DNA molecules containing a randomized 40-nucleotide sequence to isolate aptamers that bind phospholamban. One of the obtained aptamers, designated Apt-9, was found to specifically bind to the cytoplasmic region of phospholamban in vitro with high affinity (dissociation constant, approximately 20 nM). Apt-9 increased the Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of cardiac SR vesicles but not that of SR vesicles from skeletal muscle in a concentration-dependent manner. It also shifted the Ca(2+) concentration-response curve for this ATPase activity to the left. These effects of Apt-9 were not mimicked by an oligonucleotide with a scrambled version of the Apt-9 sequence. Thus, our results indicate that Apt-9 activates SERCA2a by alleviating the inhibitory effect of phospholamban on this ATPase, and they suggest that phospholamban-specific aptamers warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic agents for heart failure and cardiomyopathy.",

These trials were critically reviewed and categorized based on therapeutic modality. RESULTS: Forty-four RCTs and 9 meta-analyses met the search criteria. Significant findings from these trials were analyzed. The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study. Tirilazad is ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use. Nimodipine is the only treatment that provided a significant benefit across multiple studies.",

The West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication. Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined. To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides. Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors. Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp. The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains. These data support a structural model of the full-length NS5 molecule that predicts a physical interaction between the MTase and the RdRp domains.",

In the present review, we re-evaluate the models of transcription factories in the light of recent and older data. Based on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific, co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear space. Targeting genes to be transcribed to protein-dense factories that contain all factors necessary for transcription initiation and elongation through chromatin templates clearly favors a more economical utilization and better recycling of the transcription machinery.",

It has long been demonstrated that a subset of patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) develop ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) in the salivary glands (SG). These structures are characterised by periductal clusters of T and B lymphocytes, development of high endothelial venules and differentiation of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) networks. Evidence in patients with and animal models of SS demonstrated that the formation and maintenance of ELS in the SG is critically dependent on the ectopic expression of lymphotoxins (LT) and lymphoid chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, CCL21 and CXCL12. Several cell types, including resident epithelial, stromal and endothelial cells as well as different subsets of infiltrating immune cells, have been shown to be capable of producing some of these factors during chronic inflammation in SS. In this review we focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of ELS in SS SG, with particular emphasis on the role of lymphoid chemokines. In addition, we summarise accumulating data in support of the notion that ELS in SS represent functional niches whereby autoreactive B cells undergo affinity maturation, clonal selection and differentiation into autoantibody producing cells, thus contributing to autoimmunity over and above secondary lymphoid organs. Furthermore, we review the emerging role of ELS and lymphoid chemokines in driving extranodal B cell lymphomagenesis in SS and we focus on recent evidence suggesting that ELS identify subsets of SS patients at increased risk of developing systemic manifestations and lymphoma.",

Here we use transcriptional profiling of human fetal brain cultures to identify an activity-dependent secreted factor, Osteocrin (OSTN), that is induced by membrane depolarization of human but not mouse neurons. We find that OSTN has been repurposed in primates through the evolutionary acquisition of DNA regulatory elements that bind the activity-regulated transcription factor MEF2.

METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify case series and epidemiologic studies that have evaluated MBC risk among patients with KS. RESULTS: Case reports without expected values have often led to false impressions of risk. Problems include that a diagnosis of cancer can prompt a karyotypic evaluation and that many cases of KS are unrecognized, resulting in incomplete denominators. Few carefully conducted epidemiologic studies have been undertaken given that both KS and MBC are rare events. The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics. These risks were still approximately 70% lower than among females, contradicting case reports that patients with KS have breast cancer rates similar to females. Altered hormone levels (especially the ratio of oestrogens to androgens), administration of exogenous androgens, gynaecomastia and genetic factors have been offered as possible explanations for the high risks. CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones.",

The complex binds a structural GAIT element in the 3' untranslated region of VEGF-A and other inflammation-related transcripts and inhibits their translation. EPRS is dually phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) at Ser(886) and then by a Cdk5-dependent-AGC kinase at Ser(999); L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by death-associated protein kinases DAPK and ZIPK. Because profound differences in inflammatory responses between mice and humans are known, we investigated the GAIT system in mouse macrophages. The murine GAIT complex is heterotrimeric, lacking NSAP1. As in humans, IFN-\u03b3 activates the mouse macrophage GAIT system via induced phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a. Murine L13a is phosphorylated at Ser(77) by the DAPK-ZIPK cascade, but EPRS is phosphorylated only at Ser(999). Loss of EPRS Ser(886) phosphorylation prevents NSAP1 incorporation into the GAIT complex. However, the triad of Ser(999)-phosphorylated EPRS, Ser(77)-phosphorylated L13a, and GAPDH forms a functional GAIT complex that inhibits translation of GAIT target mRNAs.

BACKGROUND: The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. We describe a link between EZH2 function and actin polymerization in prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Nuclear and cytoplasmic EZH2 expression in benign and malignant prostate tissue samples was assessed. An association between EZH2 function and actin polymerization in prostate cancer cells was investigated using siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Effects of EZH2 knock-down on actin polymerization dynamics were analyzed biochemically using immunoblot analysis of cell lysate fractions, and morphologically using immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. Knock-down of EZH2 in PC3 prostate cancer cells increases the amount of F-actin polymerization, cell size, and formation of actin-rich filaments.

We present the structure of the histone H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 in complex with its histone H4 peptide substrate and S-adenosyl methionine cofactor. Analysis of the structure reveals that the Suv4-20h2 active site diverges from the canonical SET domain configuration and generates a high degree of both substrate and product specificity. Together with supporting biochemical data comparing Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2, we demonstrate that the Suv4-20 family enzymes take a previously mono-methylated H4K20 substrate and generate an exclusively di-methylated product.

Different combinations of receptors produce different qualities and levels of pathway activation.

Although HER2 can be over-expressed in prostate cancer, there is no clinical data to support the use of trastuzumab for prostate cancer patients.

Data points towards the importance of inhibiting multiple members of the HER-kinase family to achieve more complete blockade of this axis for cancers other than HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

The promoter activity of yeast genes can depend on lysine 56 (K56) acetylation of histone H3. This modification of H3 is performed by lysine acetylase Rtt109 acting in concert with histone chaperone Asf1. We have examined the contributions of Rtt109, Asf1, and H3 K56 acetylation to nutrient regulation of a well-studied metabolic gene, ARG1. As expected, Rtt109, Asf1, and H3 K56 acetylation are required for maximal transcription of ARG1 under inducing conditions. However, Rtt109 and Asf1 also inhibit ARG1 under repressing conditions. This inhibition requires Asf1 binding to H3-H4 and Rtt109 KAT activity, but not tail acetylation of H3-H4 or K56 acetylation of H3. These observations suggest the existence of a unique mechanism of transcriptional regulation by Rtt109. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation and genetic interaction studies support a model in which promoter-targeted Rtt109 represses ARG1 by silencing a pathway of transcriptional activation that depends on ASF1.

Rash is inconsistently reported as a common adverse event in most clinical trials of pertuzumab, at varying incidences. In this study, we have investigated the overall incidence and risk of rash with pertuzumab.

Eligible studies were prospective phase II-III clinical trials using pertuzumab in cancer patients. Incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of included studies. Data from a total of 1,726 patients (pertuzumab, n = 1,157; controls, n = 569) with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers from eight clinical trials were included for analysis.

The risk varied with tumor types, as patients with prostate cancer had a lower incidence of rash (13.2 %; 95 % CI 8.0-21.1 %) than those with breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer (P = 0.001). Overall, pertuzumab significantly increased the risk of rash in comparison with controls (RR 1.53; 95 % CI 1.12-2.09; P = 0.007). Pertuzumab is associated with a significant risk of rash, and the incidence varies among different tumor types. Prevention, early recognition, and appropriate treatment of this rash may lead to improvement in patient quality of life, adherence to therapy, and possibly optimize clinical outcomes.",

The current study investigated the behavioral phenotype of MWS. Parents and carers of 61 individuals with MWS completed the Developmental Behavior Checklist. Data were compared with those for individuals selected from an epidemiological sample of people with ID from other causes. The behaviors associated with MWS included a high rate of oral behaviors, an increased rate of repetitive behaviors, and an under-reaction to pain. Other aspects of the MWS behavioral phenotype are suggestive of a happy affect and sociable demeanor. Despite this, those with MWS displayed similarly high levels of behavioral problems as those with intellectual disabilities from other causes, with over 30% showing clinically significant levels of behavioral or emotional disturbance. These findings have the potential to expand our knowledge of the role of the ZEB2 gene during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, they are a foundation for informing interventions and management options to enhance the independence and quality of life for persons with MWS.",

SUMOylation is a form of post-translational modification where small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) are covalently attached to target proteins to regulate their properties.

However, it is largely unclear if SUMOylation contributes to the pathogenesis of kidney diseases, such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we have demonstrated a dynamic change of protein SUMOylation in ischemic and cisplatin nephrotoxic AKI in mice. In rat kidney proximal tubular cells (RPTC), cisplatin-induced SUMOylation was diminished by two antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine and dimethylurea), supporting a role of oxidative stress in the activation of SUMOylation. In addition, SUMOylation by SUMO-2/3, but not SUMO-1, was partially suppressed by pifithrin-alpha (a pharmacological inhibitor of p53), supporting a role of p53 in SUMOylation by SUMO-2/3. We further examined the role of SUMOylation during cisplatin treatment of RPTC by using ginkgolic acid (GA), a pharmacological inhibitor of SUMOylation. Pretreatment with GA suppressed SUMOylation and importantly, GA enhanced apoptosis during cisplatin incubation. Taken together, the results demonstrate the first evidence of SUMOylation in AKI and suggest that SUMOylation may play a cytoprotective role in kidney tubular cells.",

Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo.

The RelB-p52 heterodimer, for instance, is the key element of the alternative NF-\u03baB signaling pathway supporting the expression of a subset of NF-\u03baB target genes. By contrast, RelB is crucial for the repression of important pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF\u03b1 or interleukin 1\u03b2. Despite accumulating reports describing the functional variability of RelB, the molecular mechanisms underlying these divergent functions are still unknown. One potential explanation could be a functional reprogramming of RelB by different post-translational modifications. Here, we demonstrate that SUMOylation of RelB might be one of these post-translational modifications rendering the function of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor RelB. In vivo SUMOylation analyses using either the UBC9-fusion-directed SUMOylation method or endogenous proteins from Namalwa B cells revealed that RelB is modified by either SUMO1 or SUMO2 attachment at various sites. Functional studies suggest that SUMOylation converts RelB into a transcriptional repressor. For instance, a SUMO1-RelB fusion protein mimicking RelB-SUMOylation displayed a reduced transcriptional activity in comparison to wild type RelB. Consistently, inactivation of specific SUMOylation sites in the central part of RelB augmented the transcription activity of the corresponding RelB mutant.

BACKGROUND: Glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in neuronal oxidant defence. Depletion of cellular GSH is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and thereby contributes to the associated oxidative stress and Ca2+ dysregulation. Whether depletion of cellular GSH, associated with neuronal senescence, directly influences Ca2+ permeation pathways is not known. Transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in several cell types including hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, activation of TRPM2 during oxidative stress has been linked to cell death. Importantly, GSH has been reported to inhibit TRPM2 channels, suggesting they may directly contribute to Ca2+ dysregulation associated with neuronal senescence. Herein, we explore the relation between cellular GSH and TRPM2 channel activity in long-term cultures of hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observe that TRPM2 current density increases in cultured pyramidal neurons over time in vitro. The observed increase in current density was prevented by treatment with NAC, a precursor to GSH synthesis. Conversely, treatment of cultures maintained for 2 weeks in vitro with L-BSO, which depletes GSH by inhibiting its synthesis, augments TRPM2 currents. Additionally, we demonstrate that GSH inhibits TRPM2 currents through a thiol-independent mechanism, and produces a 3.5-fold shift in the dose-response curve generated by ADPR, the intracellular agonist for TRPM2. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that GSH plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of TRPM2 currents in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. This interaction may play an important role in aging and neurological diseases associated with depletion of GSH.",

The mechanisms by which haematopoiesis is restricted to this domain, and how the morphological transformation from endothelial to haematopoietic is controlled are unknown. We show here that HoxA3, a gene uniquely expressed in the embryonic but not yolk sac vasculature, restrains haematopoietic differentiation of the earliest endothelial progenitors, and induces reversion of the earliest haematopoietic progenitors into CD41-negative endothelial cells. This reversible modulation of endothelial-haematopoietic state is accomplished by targeting key haematopoietic transcription factors for downregulation, including Runx1, Gata1, Gfi1B, Ikaros, and PU.1. Through loss-of-function, and gain-of-function epistasis experiments, and the identification of antipodally regulated targets, we show that among these factors, Runx1 is uniquely able to erase the endothelial program set up by HoxA3. These results suggest both why a frank endothelium does not precede haematopoiesis in the yolk sac, and why haematopoietic stem cell generation requires Runx1 expression only in endothelial cells.",

In contrast to these observations, it is still unclear whether ex vivo genetic correction of FA HSCs also provides a similar proliferation advantage to FA HSCs. Using an FA mouse model with a marked hematopoietic phenotype, the FA-D1 (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27)) mice, we demonstrate that the lentivirus-mediated gene therapy of FA HSCs results in the progressive expansion of genetically corrected clones in mild-conditioned FA-D1 recipients. Consistent with these data, hematopoietic progenitors from FA recipients progressively became mitomycin C resistant and their chromosomal instability was reverted. No evidence of myelodysplasia, leukemias, or abnormal clonal repopulation was observed at multiple time points in primary or secondary recipients.

Emilia-Romagna Study Group on Clinical and Epidemiological Problems in Neurology. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence rate of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome variants in an unselected population and to describe their clinical features and prognosis. METHODS: A two year prospective multicentre study on the incidence and prognosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was performed in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy (3,909,512 inhabitants). A surveillance system was instituted within the study area, which comprised all the neurological departments, private and public general hospitals, and practising neurologists. The international classification of diseases (ICD) codes 357.XX (any peripheral neuropathy) of hospital discharges were also reviewed. RESULTS: Data were separately analysed for Miller Fisher syndrome and other Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome variants. During the study period 18 patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome variants including seven with Miller Fisher syndrome were recruited; the incidence rates were 0.14/100000/year (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.07-0.25) for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome variants (excluding Miller Fisher syndrome) and 0.09/100000/year (95% CI 0.04-0.18) for Miller Fisher syndrome.

Our results show that two of the glutathione peroxidase family members (GPX1 and GPX4) are highly induced by supplemental selenium in prostate cancer cells but only slightly induced in RWPE-1 cells. In addition, GPX1 levels are dramatically lower in PC-3 cells as compared to RWPE-1 or LNCaP cells. GPX2 protein and mRNA, however, are only detectable in RWPE-1 cells. Of the three selenium compounds tested (sodium selenite, sodium selenate and selenomethionine), only sodium selenite shows toxicity in a physiological range of selenium concentrations.

A 64-year-old woman who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with disturbance of vertical ocular movement was presented. She was admitted to our hospital with progressive dysphagia, dysarythria and weakness of the extremities. Neurological examinations revealed disturbance of vertical ocular movement with normal doll's eye phenomenon (supranuclear origin), bulbar palsy, muscle weakness of the extremities, extensor plantar signs, and fasciculations of the costal and interosseal muscles. EMG studies showed denervation potentials, and muscle biopsy demonstrated group atrophy, fiber type grouping and small angular fibers. TRH injections resulted in improvement of disturbance of vertical ocular movement, but no effect was seen on the weakness of the limb. There was about 20 Japanese cases with disturbance of ocular movement in ALS, but it was rare to see ocular movement disorder from the early stage of ALS. The pathophysiology of ocular movement disorder in ALS has been thought to be due to supranuclear origin, i.e., the disturbance in the pathway from the frontal cortex to the mesencephalon. In this case, TRH might effect at some point of the frontomesencephalic pathway.",

BACKGROUND: Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. Although IL-27 has been shown to have potent anti-tumor activity in various cancer models, the role of IL-27 in EMT and angiogenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-27 in regulating EMT and angiogenesis through modulation of the STAT pathways in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. METHODS: STAT activation following IL-27 exposure was measured in human NSCLC cell lines. Expression of epithelial (E-cadherin, \u03b3-catenin) and mesenchymal (N-cadherin, vimentin) markers were assessed by Western blot analysis. Production of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL5) were examined by ELISA. Cell motility was examined by an in vitro scratch and transwell migration assays. Selective inhibitors of STAT1 (STAT1 siRNAs) and STAT3 (Stattic) were used to determine whether both STAT1 and STAT3 are required for IL-27 mediated inhibition of EMT and secretion of angiogenic factors. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that IL-27 stimulation in NSCLC resulted in 1) STAT1 and STAT3 activation in a JAK-dependent manner, 2) development of epithelial phenotypes, including a decrease in the expression of a transcriptional repressor for E-cadherin (SNAIL), and mesenchymal marker (vimentin) with a reciprocal increase in the expression of epithelial markers, 3) inhibition of cell migration, and 4) reduced production of pro-angiogenic factors. STAT1 inhibition in IL-27-treated cells reversed the IL-27 effect with resultant increased expression of Snail, vimentin and the pro-angiogenic factors. The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. CONCLUSION: IL-27 induces mesenchymal to epithelial transition and inhibits the production of pro-angiogenic factors in a STAT1-dominant pathway. These findings highlight the importance of STAT1 in repressing lung carcinogenesis and describe a new anti-tumor mechanism of IL-27.",

AIMS: To investigate whether phospholamban gene (PLN) mutations underlie patients diagnosed with either arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened a cohort of 97 ARVC and 257 DCM unrelated index patients for PLN mutations and evaluated their clinical characteristics. PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients. Haplotype analysis revealed a common founder, estimated to be between 575 and 825 years old. A low voltage electrocardiogram was present in 46 % of R14del carriers. Compared with R14del- DCM patients, R14del+ DCM patients more often demonstrated appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator discharge (47 % vs. 10 % , P < 0.001), cardiac transplantation (18 % vs. 2 % , P < 0.001), and a family history for sudden cardiac death (SCD) at < 50 years (36 % vs. 16 % , P = 0.007). We observed a similar pattern in the ARVC patients although this was not statistically significant. The average age of 26 family members who died of SCD was 37.7 years. Immunohistochemistry in available myocardial samples revealed absent/depressed plakoglobin levels at intercalated disks in five of seven (71 %) R14del+ ARVC samples, but in only one of nine (11 %) R14del+ DCM samples (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC. R14del+ patients diagnosed with DCM showed an arrhythmogenic phenotype, and SCD at young age can be the presenting symptom. These findings support the concept of 'arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy'.",

HERG (human eag-related gene) encodes an inward-rectifier potassium channel formed by the assembly of four subunits. Since the truncated HERG protein in patients with long QT syndrome induces a dominant phenotype, that is, cardiac sudden death, the assembly of nonfunctional complexes between wild-type and mutated subunits was implicated in causing the disease. To understand HERG-mediated cardiac sudden death at the molecular level, it is important to determine which regions in the HERG protein participate in subunit interaction. We therefore report the identification of a subunit interaction domain, NAB(HERG), that is localized at the hydrophilic cytoplasmic N terminus and can form a tetramer in the absence of the rest of the HERG protein. Truncated HERG proteins containing NAB(HERG), including one that resulted from the delta1261 human mutation, inhibit the functional expression of the HERG channel in transfected cells. Together, these results support the notion that the expression of HERG in the human heart may be decreased in the presence of the truncated subunit. Such a decrease of potassium channel expression can contribute to the longer QT intervals observed in the patients with the HERG mutation.",

BACKGROUND: Exosomes are cytoplasm containing vesicles released by many cells that can be found in several biological fluids including urine. Urinary exosomes are released from every segment of the nephron, are detectable in urine, constitutively contain RNA (small RNAs and mRNAs) and harbor unique subset of proteins, reflecting their cellular source. METHODS: With the aim of establishing the optimal protocol for high throughput analysis of exosomal miRNAs, we compared three different urinary exosomes isolation methods and six RNA extraction techniques. Exosomal RNA yield, size and quality were assessed respectively by specific staining with fluorescent dye, capillary electrophoresis and analysis of spectrophotometric parameters. MiRNAs detection and abundance was determined by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Among the exosomes isolation methods, Ultrafiltration resulted to be the most suited. The highest exosomal RNA yield quantified by RiboGreen\u00ae staining was obtained with the combination of TRI Reagent\u2122 with miRNeasy\u00ae, followed by TRI Reagent\u2122, SeraMir\u2122, miRCURY\u2122, mirVana\u2122 and miRNeasy\u00ae; but after a multivariate analysis, SeraMir\u2122 scored as the method of choice in terms of miRNA yield, purity and RT-qPCR miRNAs quantification accuracy. Storage conditions were also analyzed, showing that the relative abundance of urinary exosomal miRNAs is not influenced by urine freezing. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of appropriate urinary exosomal miRNA isolation method was dependent on various validation results. Ultrafiltration in combination with SeraMir\u2122 exoRNA columns represents the optimal procedure for a rapid, cost-effective and efficient purification of miRNAs from urinary exosomes, perfectly suited for further applicative research in the field of miRNAs in kidney physiology and pathology.",

The second trimester is the safest time for travelling, because the pregnant woman feels generally most at ease and the risk of spontaneous abortion and pre-term labour is very low. Possible risks must be discussed with the obstetrician before travelling. If the pregnancy is uncomplicated most airlines allow flying up to the 36th (domestic flights) and 35th (international flights) week of gestation. Unless the fetal oxygen supply is already impaired at ground level due to an underlying disease, flying does not pose a risk of fetal hypoxia. Radiation exposure during a long distant flight is low compared to the average annual exposure dosage, but the risk of thrombosis is increased. Altitudes up to 2,500 m pose no problem. Sufficient time to acclimatize must be taken when travelling to high altitudes and exercise kept to a minimum. Scuba diving is contraindicated. Since only a few drugs are completely safe during pregnancy a thorough risk/benefit evaluation is mandatory. Treatment of infections can be considerably complicated, but any necessary treatment should not be withheld because of the fear of potential fetal injury. Good knowledge of local medical resources is essential before travelling. Several personal protective measures minimize the risk of infection: food and water precautions, protection from insect bites and avoidance of crowds, unsafe sex and, if need be, freshwater. Many vaccinations are recommended for travellers. However, live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant women because of theoretical considerations. Exceptionally a yellow fever vaccination may be given after the first trimester. Killed, inactivated or polysaccharide vaccines can be given after the first trimester after a thorough risk/benefit evaluation. Because of the potentially devastating effect of malaria to the mother and the child, travelling to endemic malaria regions should be avoided. If the risk of infection is high chemoprophylaxis with mefloquine is indicated. In low-risk countries mefloquine, in South-East-Asia artemisinin derivatives should be given as stand-by treatment.",

Several treatment alternatives have been proposed for this condition, with far-from-ideal results being obtained. Magnesium sulfate recently returned to the scene (with still unproven benefit) as an adjuvant in the treatment of vasospasm. METHODS: Seventy-two patients diagnosed with SAH by aneurysm rupture were submitted to microsurgery craniotomy and subdivided in 2 groups. Group 1, formed by 48 patients, received prophylactic hypervolemic and hemodilution therapy in addition to nimodipine. Group 2, composed of 24 patients, received the same treatment of group 1 with the addition of magnesium sulfate in continuous infusion from 120 to 150 mg a day, keeping serum magnesium levels close to double normal values. RESULTS: Age was 49 +/- 12.6 years. Ratio of female to male was 3.16:1. Most patients were admitted in a Hunt-Hess grade 2 (46.4%) and Fisher grade 3 (52.8%). Anterior communicating artery aneurysms were the most common in location (38.8%). Both groups were compared, and there was no statistical difference related to age, sex, and Glasgow, Fisher, or Hunt-Hess admission grades. No statistical difference in vasospasm incidence was found between the two groups. However, in group 1, vasospasm was correlated with a longer hospitalization time (P = .0003), different from group 2, in which patients with vasospasm receiving magnesium sulfate required less hospitalization time.

BACKGROUND: Men with Klinefelter syndrome have one or more extra X chromosomes and have endocrine abnormalities. Case reports have led to suggestions that men with Klinefelter syndrome have elevated risks of several cancers, but published cohort studies have been relatively small. We conducted a nationwide cohort study to examine these risks. METHODS: We followed a cohort of 3518 men who had been cytogenetically diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome in Britain from 1959 through 2002 and compared their cancer incidence and mortality with that of men in the national population. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all cancers was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 1.4). Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7). The standardized mortality ratios were particularly high for breast cancer among men with 47,XXY mosaicism (SMR = 222.8, 95% CI = 45.9 to 651.0) and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men with a 48,XXYY constitution (SMR = 36.7, 95% CI = 4.4 to 132.5). The cancer incidence data corroborated these associations. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer.",

Angiogenesis is required for invasive tumor growth and metastasis and constitutes an important point in the control of cancer progression. Its inhibition may be a valuable new approach to cancer therapy. Avascular tumors are severely restricted in their growth potential because of the lack of a blood supply. For tumors to develop in size and metastatic potential they must make an \"angiogenic switch\" through perturbing the local balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. Frequently, tumors overexpress proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, allowing them to make this angiogenic switch. Two strategies used in the development of antiangiogenic agents involve the inhibition of proangiogenic factors (eg, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibodies) as well as therapy with endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as endostatin and angiostatin. Therapy with endogenous angiogenic inhibitors such as endostatin and angiostatin may reverse the angiogenic switch preventing growth of tumor vasculature. Preclinical studies have shown that endostatin effectively inhibits tumor growth and shrinks existing tumor blood vessels. Phase 1 clinical trials of endostatin and angiostatin are ongoing, and preliminary results show minimal toxicities.",

Differential diagnosis of small round cell sarcomas (SRCSs) grouped under the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) can be a challenging situation for pathologists. Recent studies have revealed that some groups of Ewing-like sarcoma show typical ESFT morphology but lack any EWSR1-ETS gene fusions. Here we identified a novel gene fusion, CIC-FOXO4, in a case of Ewing-like sarcoma with a t(X;19)(q13;q13.3) translocation. The patient was a 63-year-old man who had an asymptomatic, 30-mm, well-demarcated, intramuscular mass in his right posterior neck, and imaging findings suggested a diagnosis of high-grade sarcoma. He was treated with complete resection and subsequent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He was alive without local recurrence or distant metastasis 6 months after the operation. Histologic examination revealed SRCS with abundant desmoplastic fibrous stroma suggesting a desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis showed weak to moderate and partial staining for MIC2 (CD99) and WT1, respectively. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing revealed a gene fusion, and the genomic rearrangement between the CIC and FOXO4 genes was identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Aside from the desmoplastic stroma, the CIC-FOXO4 fusion sarcoma showed morphologic and immunohistochemical similarity to ESFT and Ewing-like sarcomas, including the recently described CIC-DUX4 fusion sarcoma. Although clinicopathologic analysis with additional cases is necessary, we conclude that CIC-FOXO4 fusion sarcoma is a new type of Ewing-like sarcoma that has a specific genetic signature.

TGF-\u03b2 Inducible Early Gene-1 (TIEG1) is a Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factor (KLF10) that was originally cloned from human osteoblasts as an early response gene to TGF-\u03b2 treatment. As reported previously, TIEG1(-/-) mice have decreased cortical bone thickness and vertebral bone volume and have increased spacing between the trabeculae in the femoral head relative to wildtype controls. Here, we have investigated the role of TIEG1 in osteoclasts to further determine their potential role in mediating this phenotype. We have found that TIEG1(-/-) osteoclast precursors differentiated more slowly compared to wildtype precursors in vitro and high RANKL doses are able to overcome this defect. We also discovered that TIEG1(-/-) precursors exhibit defective RANKL-induced phosphorylation and accumulation of NFATc1 and the NFATc1 target gene DC-STAMP. Higher RANKL concentrations reversed defective NFATc1 signaling and restored differentiation. After differentiation, wildtype osteoclasts underwent apoptosis more quickly than TIEG1(-/-) osteoclasts. We observed increased AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathway activation in TIEG1(-/-) osteoclasts, consistent with the roles of these kinases in promoting osteoclast survival. Adenoviral delivery of TIEG1 (AdTIEG1) to TIEG1(-/-) cells reversed the RANKL-induced NFATc1 signaling defect in TIEG1(-/-) precursors and eliminated the differentiation and apoptosis defects. Suppression of TIEG1 with siRNA in wildtype cells reduced differentiation and NFATc1 activation. Together, these data provide evidence that TIEG1 controls osteoclast differentiation by reducing NFATc1 pathway activation and reduces osteoclast survival by suppressing AKT and MEK/ERK signaling.",

          "context": "Diversity in the glucose transporter-4 gene (SLC2A4) in humans reflects the action of natural selection along the old-world primates evolution. BACKGROUND: Glucose is an important source of energy for living organisms. In vertebrates it is ingested with the diet and transported into the cells by conserved mechanisms and molecules, such as the trans-membrane Glucose Transporters (GLUTs). Members of this family have tissue specific expression, biochemical properties and physiologic functions that together regulate glucose levels and distribution. GLUT4 -coded by SLC2A4 (17p13) is an insulin-sensitive transporter with a critical role in glucose homeostasis and diabetes pathogenesis, preferentially expressed in the adipose tissue, heart muscle and skeletal muscle. We tested the hypothesis that natural selection acted on SLC2A4. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We re-sequenced SLC2A4 and genotyped 104 SNPs along a approximately 1 Mb region flanking this gene in 102 ethnically diverse individuals. Across the studied populations (African, European, Asian and Latin-American), all the eight common SNPs are concentrated in the N-terminal region upstream of exon 7 ( approximately 3700 bp), while the C-terminal region downstream of intron 6 ( approximately 2600 bp) harbors only 6 singletons, a pattern that is not compatible with neutrality for this part of the gene. Tests of neutrality based on comparative genomics suggest that: (1) episodes of natural selection (likely a selective sweep) predating the coalescent of human lineages, within the last 25 million years, account for the observed reduced diversity downstream of intron 6 and, (2) the target of natural selection may not be in the SLC2A4 coding sequence. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the contrast in the pattern of genetic variation between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are signatures of the action of natural selection and thus follow-up studies should investigate the functional importance of different regions of the SLC2A4 gene.",

INTRODUCTION: Antiangiogenic approaches are currently the dominating experimental therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma. First enthusiasm was provoked by promising radiological response rates and an apparent clinical benefit with some of these agents. Major limitations include the modest number of durable responses, the lack of cytotoxic antitumor activity, of synergy when combined with chemotherapy and of an overall survival benefit. AREAS COVERED: We review the rationale as well as preclinical and clinical evidence for the future development of antiangiogenic agents in glioblastoma. The most prominent approach targets VEGF and includes agents such as the VEGF antibody bevacizumab, the VEGF receptor fusion protein aflibercept or the tyrosine kinase inhibitors cediranib and XL-184. Inhibition of angiogenic pathways by small molecules, for example, enzastaurin, or anti-integrin-based approaches, for example, cilengitide, represent alternative strategies. EXPERT OPINION: Enzastaurin and cediranib failed in randomized Phase III trials in recurrent glioblastoma, aflibercept in Phase II. By contrast, bevacizumab was conditionally approved in many countries. Recently completed Phase III trials for bevacizumab and cilengitide in the first-line setting will define the future role of these agents. This intense clinical trial activity reflects the hope that antiangiogenic agents will become part of the limited therapeutic options for glioblastoma.",

OBJECTIVES: Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy, postpartum, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, heavy uterine bleeding, cancer and following surgery. We estimate the budget impact (BI) on the Swiss mandatory health insurance associated with substituting iron sucrose (standard) with ferric carboxymaltose (new treatment) using real-life data. METHODS: Resource use was based on recent primary data (Polyquest Prescriber Analysis, Anemia Patient Record Study in Switzerland). Personnel costs were estimated using the Swiss Tarmed fee-for-service reimbursement system. Drug costs and costs of materials used were based on official tariffs (Spezialit\u00e4tenliste, MiGeL). Actual IMS sales data of both products were used to verify the BI model (1 CHF = 1 USD, Jan 2013). RESULTS: Ferric carboxymaltose was associated with cost savings of 30-44 % per patient per treatment cycle compared to iron sucrose. Costs per 200/500/1,000 mg total dosage treatment cycle were CHF 101/210/420 for ferric carboxymaltose and CHF 144/375/721 for iron sucrose. This results in cost savings of CHF 22-31 million across all indications in 2009. Savings were driven by personnel cost reductions (application time and number of applications). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these cost savings, even for the higher application costs of ferric carboxymaltose, with minimum savings of CHF 17 million per year. CONCLUSIONS: Treating iron deficiency involves substantial costs to the Swiss MHI which may be reduced by substituting iron sucrose with ferric carboxymaltose. The use of real-life data raises methodological questions about the fundamental compatibility of this data with the conceptual framework of BI analysis.",

BACKGROUND: A newly introduced cell-free fetal DNA sequencing based non-invasive prenatal testing (DNA-NIPT) detects Down syndrome with sensitivity of 99% at early gestational stage without risk of miscarriage. Attention has been given to its public health implications; little is known from consumer perspectives. This qualitative study aimed to explore women's motivations for using, and perceptions of, DNA-NIPT in Hong Kong. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 45 women who had undertaken DNA-NIPT recruited by purposive sampling based on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The sample included 31 women identified as high-risk from serum and ultrasound based Down syndrome screening (SU-DSS). Thematic narrative analysis examined informed-decision making of the test and identified the benefits and needs. Women outlined a number of reasons for accessing DNA-NIPT: reducing the uncertainty associated with risk probability-based results from SU-DSS, undertaking DNA-NIPT as a comprehensive measure to counteract risk from childbearing especially at advanced age, perceived predictive accuracy and absence of risk of harm to fetus. Accounts of women deemed high-risk or not high-risk are distinctive in a number of respects. High-risk women accessed DNA-NIPT to get a clearer idea of their risk. This group perceived SU-DSS as an unnecessary and confusing procedure because of its varying, protocol-dependent detection rates. Those women not deemed high-risk, in contrast, undertook DNA-NIPT for psychological assurance and to reduce anxiety even after receiving the negative result from SU-DSS. CONCLUSIONS: DNA-NIPT was regarded positively by women who chose this method of screening over the routine, less expensive testing options. Given its perceived utility, health providers need to consider whether DNA-NIPT should be offered as part of universal routine care to women at high-risk for fetal aneuploidy. If this is the case, then further development of guidelines and quality assurance will be needed to provide a service suited to patients' needs.",

PURPOSE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders caused by loss of expression of imprinted genes from the 15q11-q13 region depending on the parent of origin. Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) kits from MRC-Holland (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were used to detect PWS and AS deletion subtypes. We report our experience with two versions of the MS-MLPA-PWS/AS kit (original A1 and newer B1) in determining methylation status and deletion subtypes in individuals with PWS. METHODS: MS-MLPA analysis was performed on DNA isolated from a large cohort of PWS subjects with the MS-MLPA-PWS/AS-A1 and -B1 probe sets. RESULTS: Both MS-MLPA kits will identify deletions in the 15q11-q13 region but the original MS-MLPA-A1 kit has a higher density of probes at the telomeric end of the 15q11-q13 region, which is more useful for identifying individuals with atypical deletions. The newer B1 kit contains more probes in the imprinting center (IC) and adjoining small noncoding RNAs useful in identifying small microdeletions. CONCLUSION: The A1 kit identified the typical deletions and smaller atypical deletions, whereas the B1 kit was more informative for identifying microdeletions including the IC and SNORD116 regions. Both kits should be made available for accurate characterization of PWS/AS deletion subtypes as well as evaluating for IC and SNORD116 microdeletions.",

We analyzed 94 probands and detected 9 frameshift mutations in 12 individuals, 1 benign BRCA2 nonsense mutation and numerous missense and synonymous mutations in both genes. Frequency of frameshift mutations is 12.77%. In addition to two novel mutations detected in our population we reported previously, we detected another novel mutation--c.7283delT in BRCA2 exon 14. None of the detected deleterious mutations may be considered as founder mutations for Serbian population, as each of them was found in no more than two high-risk families. This mutation diversity is most probably due to high migration rate in history of this part of Europe.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by syncopal events and sudden cardiac death at a young age during physical stress or emotion, in the absence of structural heart disease. We report the first nonsense mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin gene, CASQ2, in three CPVT families. The three mutations, a nonsense R33X, a splicing 532+1 G>A, and a 1-bp deletion, 62delA, are thought to induce premature stop codons. Two patients who experienced syncopes before the age of 7 years were homozygous carriers, suggesting a complete absence of calsequestrin 2. One patient was heterozygous for the stop codon and experienced syncopes from the age of 11 years. Despite the different mutations, there is little phenotypic variation of CPVT for the CASQ2 mutations. Of the 16 heterozygous carriers of these various mutations, 14 were devoid of clinical symptoms or ECG anomalies, whereas 2 of them had ventricular arrhythmias at ECG on exercise tests. In line with this, the diagnosis of the probands was difficult because of the absence of a positive family history. In conclusion, these additional three CASQ2 CPVT families suggest that CASQ2 mutations are more common than previously thought and produce a severe form of CPVT.

PURPOSE: Transient cardiac ventricular dysfunction or sudden cardiac deaths have been reported for male athletes participating in marathon racing.

METHODS: At the 31st real,- Berlin Marathon plasma levels of NT-pro-BNP, BNP, cTnI and cTnT were measured in 15 women (age 35+/-6 years; finishing times between 3:22 h and 5:21 h) at four different time points (before, immediately after, day one and day three). RESULTS: An increase in [NT-pro-BNP] was observed immediately after the marathon (median [NT-pro-BNP] before: 39.6 pg ml(-1), after: 138.6 pg ml(-1), p=0.003) with a further increase on day one. [BNP] did not increase immediately after the marathon but increased on day one (median [BNP] before: 15 pg ml(-1), day one: 27.35 pg ml(-1), p=0.006). On day three, [NT-pro-BNP] and [BNP] returned to initial values. [cTnI] was under the detection limit prior to the marathon in all runners. [cTnT] was under the detection limit before the marathon except in one runner who presented a concentration of 0.03 ng ml(-1). Cardiac troponins (median [cTnl] after: 0.098 ng ml(-1), p=0.028; median [cTnT] after: 0.032 ng ml(-1), p=0.012) increased immediately after the marathon and returned to initial values on day one [cTnT] and three [cTnI]. DISCUSSION: Parameters representing cardiac stress increased in females after a marathon. Different kinetics of natriuretic peptides BNP and NT-pro-BNP post-marathon could be due to their different half-lives and dependence on renal function. The increase of cTnI and cTnT may result from minor myocardial lesions.",

Apremilast, an oral small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), is in development for chronic inflammatory disorders, and has shown efficacy in psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathies, and Beh\u00e7et's syndrome. In March 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved apremilast for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. The properties of apremilast were evaluated to determine its specificity, effects on intracellular signaling, gene and protein expression, and in vivo pharmacology using models of innate and adaptive immunity. Apremilast inhibited PDE4 isoforms from all four sub-families (A1A, B1, B2, C1, and D2), with IC50 values in the range of 10 to 100 nM. Apremilast did not significantly inhibit other PDEs, kinases, enzymes, or receptors. While both apremilast and thalidomide share a phthalimide ring structure, apremilast lacks the glutarimide ring and thus fails to bind to cereblon, the target of thalidomide action. In monocytes and T cells, apremilast elevated intracellular cAMP and induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase A substrates CREB and activating transcription factor-1 while inhibiting NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, resulting in both up- and down-regulation of several genes induced via TLR4. Apremilast reduced interferon-\u03b1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and inhibited T-cell cytokine production, but had little effect on B-cell immunoglobulin secretion. In a transgenic T-cell and B-cell transfer murine model, apremilast (5mg/kg/day p.o.) did not affect clonal expansion of either T or B cells and had little or no effect on their expression of activation markers. The effect of apremilast on innate immunity was tested in the ferret lung neutrophilia model, which allows monitoring of the known PDE4 inhibitor gastrointestinal side effects (nausea and vomiting). Apremilast significantly inhibited lung neutrophilia at 1mg/kg, but did not induce significant emetic reflexes at doses <30 mg/kg. Overall, the pharmacological effects of apremilast are consistent with those of a targeted PDE4 inhibitor, with selective effects on innate immune responses and a wide therapeutic index compared to its gastrointestinal side effects.",

Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), famous for their ability to precisely and efficiently modify specific genomic loci, have been employed in numerous transgenic model organism and cell constructions. Here we employ the ZFNs technology, with homologous recombination (HR), to construct sequence-specific Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) knock-in cells. With the use of ZFNs, we established APP knock in cell lines with gene-modification efficiencies of about 7%. We electroporated DNA fragment containing the promoter and the protein coding regions of the zinc finger nucleases into cells, instead of the plasmids, to avoid problems associated with off target homologous recombination, and adopted a pair of mutated FokI cleavage domains to reduce the toxic effects of the ZFNs on cell growth. Since over-expression of APP, or a subdomain of it, might lead to an immediately lethal effect, we used the Cre-LoxP System to regulate APP expression. Our genetically transformed cell lines, w5c1 and s12c8, showed detectable APP and Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) production. The Swedish double mutation in the APP coding sequence enhanced APP and A\u03b2 abundance. What is more, the activity of the three key secretases in A\u03b2 formation could be modulated, indicating that these transgenic cells have potential for drug screening to modify amyloid metabolism in cells. Our transformed cells could readily be propagated in culture and should provide an excellent experimental medium for elucidating aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, especially those concerning the amyloidogenic pathways involving mutations in the APP coding sequence.

In this study, we provide the first direct evidence showing that dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a major proliferation regulator of prostate cancer, can down-regulate p27Kip1 and stimulate cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) activity in established prostate cancer cell lines. We investigated the cooperative effects of DHT and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the proliferation of androgen-responsive MDA PCa 2a and MDA PCa 2b prostate cancer cells. DHT and EGF each stimulated proliferation of these cells, but exposure of the cells to DHT and EGF together stimulated greater proliferation. Stimulation of cell proliferation by DHT and/or EGF was associated with increased CDK2 activity and a decreased level of p27Kip1. There seems to be a positive feedback stimulation loop between androgen-induced gene transcription and EGF-stimulated signal transduction, as one could stimulate the synthesis of the receptors for the other. Dual blockade of androgen receptor function with the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide and EGF receptor superfamily-mediated signal transduction with the anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody C225 and the anti-HER2 receptor monoclonal antibody Herceptin significantly enhanced growth inhibition of the MDA PCa 2a cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of counteracting both androgen receptors and EGF receptors in the development of novel therapies for prostate cancer.",

We determined whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is associated with glucose metabolism in pregnant women and the effect of ethnicity on this relationship. METHODS: We analysed serum 25OHD concentrations in 307 pregnant women attending a metropolitan obstetric clinic between October 2003 and May 2005. Measurements from 264 of the women were taken at the time of glucose tolerance testing at mid-gestation, a population therefore at increased risk for gestational diabetes. Pearson correlation analysis was used to test for univariate linear relationships between the natural log of serum 25OHD (ln-25OHD) and other variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to adjust for confounding factors. RESULTS: Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 53.8 +/- 23.9 nmol/l (sd). Ln-25OHD was negatively correlated with serum parathyroid hormone as expected (r -0.24, confidence intervals -0.35 to -0.12). Ln-25OHD was also negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r-0.20, -0.31 to -0.08), fasting insulin (r -0.20, -0.31 to -0.08) and insulin resistance as calculated by homeostasis model assessment (r -0.21, -0.32 to -0.09). The association between fasting glucose and log-transformed 25OHD concentration was of borderline significance after accounting for ethnicity, age and body mass index in multivariate analyses (-0.13, -0.26 to 0.01). The odds ratio of gestational diabetes in women with 25OHD < 50 nmol/l did not reach statistical significance (1.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89-4.17). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 25OHD concentrations are inversely related to fasting glucose, although further studies are required to establish whether this is independent of the effects of ethnic background.",

METHODS: Case-control study, matching 30 Cases with 37 Controls, with at least 24 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Groups were comparable for all characteristics, except for a higher proportion of patients with single-nodule relapses is the Controls (19 vs. 6; p=0.011).

Chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly coexist, and data suggest that renal patients have AF rates in excess of double that encountered in the general population. These patients are at increased risk of stroke, regardless of the presence or absence of AF. Furthermore, a lower GFR causes increased thromboembolic risk in patients with AF - independent of other risk factors. The dilemma facing clinicians treating this cohort of patients is that renal insufficiency confers both a thromboembolic and a bleeding risk. Renal disease also commonly coexists with other risk factors for stroke and bleeding such as hypertension and advanced age. Furthermore, bleeding risk tracks stroke risk and many risk factors are common to both thromboembolism and haemorrhage. Patients with severe renal impairment are also actively excluded from the majority of trials for stroke prevention in AF, including those trials which informed the development of stroke risk factor scoring schemes. Therefore, patients with renal disease and AF present a unique management challenge. The available data suggests that the benefit from warfarin in terms of stroke reduction is not as clear as in the general population, and there is an increased risk of bleeding complications and even ectopic vascular calcification. Thus, it is problematic to extrapolate the benefits of warfarin in the general population to a subgroup that has been actively excluded from clinical trials. The new oral anticoagulants have relatively little data in patients with severe renal impairment, and all have an element of renal excretion. There is a need for large randomised control trials in patients with renal insufficiency and on haemodialysis to provide a bank of high-quality scientific data on which clinicians can base their management decisions. Until then, we must adopt a pragmatic approach which involves careful consideration of the relative risk of stroke and bleeding in each individual patient.",

Docetaxel, a semisynthetic taxane, has exhibited significant single-agent activity against prostatic tumors. In phase I/II studies, single-agent docetaxel and the combination of docetaxel plus estramustine were effective in inducing prostate-specific antigen reductions of > or =50% in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). The underlying reason for docetaxel's clinical activity against prostate cancer has been a focus of ongoing research. Docetaxel is believed to have a twofold mechanism of antineoplastic activity: (1) inhibition of microtubular depolymerization, and (2) attenuation of the effects of bcl-2 and bcl-xL gene expression. Taxane-induced microtubule stabilization arrests cells in the G(2)M phase of the cell cycle and induces bcl-2 phosphorylation, thereby promoting a cascade of events that ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death. In preclinical studies, docetaxel had a higher affinity for tubulin and was shown to be a more potent inducer of bcl-2 phosphorylation than paclitaxel. Laboratory evidence also supports the clinical evaluation of docetaxel-based combinations that include agents such as trastuzumab and/or estramustine. The pathways for docetaxel-induced apoptosis appear to differ in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Further elucidation of these differences will be instrumental in designing targeted regimens for the treatment of localized and advanced prostate cancer.",

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Klotho (KL) is an anti-inflammatory protein that protects the endothelium from nitric oxide (NO)-induced dysfunction, reduces the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, and potentially regulates T-cell functions. KL deficiency leads to premature senescence and impaired Ca2+/Pi homeostasis, which can lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated osteopenia/osteoporosis. We investigated the changes in renal expression of Kl as a consequence of colitis. METHODS: We studied 3 mouse models of IBD: colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, colitis induced by microflora (in gnotobiotic interleukin-10(-/-)), and colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells. Effects of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN)-gamma on Kl expression and the activity of its promoter were examined in renal epithelial cells (mpkDCT4 and mIMCD3). RESULTS: Renal expression of Kl messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was reduced in all 3 models of IBD. Reduced level of KL correlated with the severity of colitis; the effect was reversed by neutralizing antibodies against TNF. In vitro, TNF inhibited Kl expression, an effect potentiated by IFN-gamma. The combination of TNF and IFN-gamma increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased NO production. The effect of IFN-gamma was reproduced by exposure to an NO donor and reversed by the iNOS inhibitor. In cells incubated with TNF and/or IFN-gamma, Kl mRNA stability was unaffected, whereas Kl promoter activity was reduced, indicating that these cytokines regulate Kl at the transcriptional level. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of KL that occurs during inflammation might account for the extraintestinal complications such as abnormalities in bone homeostasis that occur in patients with IBD.",

There is now a debate within the medical literature on the age of trisomy 21 as a disease affecting mankind. Since it was not described before 1866, some authors questioned whether this disease is an old or new condition in humans. Three methods of investigation are useful for demonstrating that trisomy 21 has been present in humans for a long time: the figuration of this condition in historical paintings, figurines, and pottery; its presence in old skeletal remains; and the origin of human chromosome 21 during primate phylogeny. Figurines strongly suggestive of trisomy 21 have been found in the Greco-Roman world, in many Central and South American pre-Columbian cultures, and in Khmer temples. In Europe, during the Renaissance, Italian and Flemish artists represented trisomy 21 in paintings of religious inspiration.

Psychiatric disorders represent a large economic burden in modern societies. However, pharmacological treatments are still far from optimal. Drugs used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (selective serotonin [5-HT] reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]) are pharmacological refinements of first-generation tricyclic drugs, discovered by serendipity, and show low efficacy and slowness of onset. Moreover, antipsychotic drugs are partly effective in positive symptoms of schizophrenia, yet they poorly treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. The present article reviews the neurobiological basis of 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A-R) function and the role of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs in the treatment of MDD, anxiety and psychotic disorders. The activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs in corticolimbic areas appears beneficial for the therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs. However, presynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs play a detrimental role in MDD, since individuals with high density or function of presynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs are more susceptible to mood disorders and suicide, and respond poorly to antidepressant drugs. Moreover, the indirect activation of presynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs by SSRIs/SNRIs reduces 5-HT neuron activity and terminal 5-HT release, thus opposing the elevation of extracellular 5-HT produced by blockade of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the forebrain. Chronic antidepressant treatment desensitizes presynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs, thus reducing the effectiveness of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback. The prevention of this process by the non-selective partial agonist pindolol accelerates clinical antidepressant effects. Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5-HT1A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. Several studies with transgenic mice have also established the respective role of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs in MDD and anxiety. In agreement with pharmacological studies, presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT1A-R activation appears necessary for anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, respectively, yet, neurodevelopmental roles for 5-HT1A-Rs are also involved. Likewise, the use of small interference RNA has enabled the showing of robust antidepressant-like effects in mice after selective knock-down of 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Postsynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) also appear important for the superior clinical effects of clozapine and other second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Despite showing a moderate in vitro affinity for 5-HT1A-Rs in binding assays, clozapine displays functional agonist properties at this receptor type in vivo. The stimulation of 5-HT1A-Rs in the PFC leads to the distal activation of the mesocortical pathway and to an increased dopamine release in PFC, an effect likely involved in the clinical actions of clozapine in negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The anxiolytic/antidepressant properties of 5-HT1A-R agonists in preclinical tests raised expectations enormously. However, these agents have achieved little clinical success, possibly due to their partial agonist character at postsynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs, together with full agonist properties at presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, as well as their gastrointestinal side effects. The partial 5-HT1A-R agonists buspirone, gepirone, and tandospirone are marketed as anxiolytic drugs, and buspirone is also used as an augmentation strategy in MDD. The development of new 5-HT1A-R agonists with selectivity for postsynaptic 5-HT1A-Rs may open new perspectives in the field.",

Paraffin-embedded tissue from 108 meningioma patients was analysed for the presence of mutations in PIK3CA and AKT1. These were correlated with the expression status of components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, including p85\u03b1 and p110\u03b3 subunits of PI3K, phosphorylated (p)-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1, as well as of p-ERK1/2, p-STAT3 and Notch-1, clinicopathological data and patient survival. A mutation in PIK3CA or AKT1 was found in around 9 % of the cases. Higher grade meningiomas displayed higher nuclear expression of p-p70S6K; higher nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of p-4E-BP1 and of Notch-1; lower cytoplasmic expression of p85\u03b1PI3K, p-p70S6K and p-ERK1/2; and lower PTEN Histo-scores (H-scores). PTEN H-score was inversely correlated with recurrence probability. In univariate survival analysis, nuclear expression of p-4E-BP1 and absence of p-ERK1/2 expression portended adverse prognosis, whereas in multivariate survival analysis, p-ERK1/2 expression emerged as an independent favourable prognostic factor. Treatment of the human meningioma cell line HBL-52 with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 resulted in reduction of p-AKT, p-p70S6K and p-ERK1/2 protein levels.

Because neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to sites of infection, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for their delayed homing to the lung. During the first 24 hr after pulmonary infection with a fully virulent Y. pestis strain, no significant changes were observed in the lungs in the levels of neutrophils infiltrate, expression of adhesion molecules, or the expression of the major neutrophil chemoattractants keratinocyte cell-derived chemokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In contrast, early induction of chemokines, rapid neutrophil infiltration and a reduced bacterial burden were observed in the lungs of mice infected with an avirulent Y. pestis strain. In vitro infection of lung-derived cell-lines with a YopJ mutant revealed the involvement of YopJ in the inhibition of chemoattractants expression. However, the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of mice infected with the mutant was still delayed and associated with rapid bacterial propagation and mortality. Interestingly, whereas KC, MIP-2 and G-CSF mRNA levels in the lungs were up-regulated early after infection with the mutant, their protein levels remained constant, suggesting that Y. pestis may employ additional mechanisms to suppress early chemoattractants induction in the lung. It therefore seems that prevention of the early influx of neutrophils to the lungs is of major importance for Y. pestis virulence. Indeed, pulmonary instillation of KC and MIP-2 to G-CSF-treated mice infected with Y. pestis led to rapid homing of neutrophils to the lung followed by a reduction in bacterial counts at 24 hr post-infection and improved survival rates. These observations shed new light on the virulence mechanisms of Y. pestis during pneumonic plague, and have implications for the development of novel therapies against this pathogen.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vortioxetine and duloxetine are two new antidepressant drugs that have been used clinically in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The objectives of this meta-analysis were to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine compared with duloxetine in MDD. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically reviewed to compare vortioxetine with duloxetine in terms of efficacy and tolerability in patients with MDD. Results were expressed as the risk ratio (RR) with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs), and weighted mean difference (WMD). Pooled estimates were calculated by using a fixed-effects model or a randomized-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity among studies. RESULTS: A total of five RCTs involving 2287 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that duloxetine was associated with a higher response rate than vortioxetine, as well as showing a similar remission rate with vortioxetine. The changes from baseline in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D24), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), CGI-Severity scale (CGI-S), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores were significantly greater in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group. CONCLUSION: Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the economic benefit of achieving remission among outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are currently employed in Korea. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study. A total of 337 outpatients with MDD with paid jobs were recruited from 14 psychiatric clinics in Korea and were then divided into three groups as follows: new visit group (n = 128), remitted group (n = 100) and non-remitted group (n = 109). The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was used to decide whether a patient should be assigned to the remitted or non-remitted group. Direct medical and non-medical costs were measured via interview with the subjects. The World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) were applied in order to measure the lost productive time (LPT) and related productivity costs. RESULTS: The three groups did not show a significant difference in direct medical cost. However, the difference between the remitted group and non-remitted group was statistically significant (25.49 \u00b1 52.99 vs. 44.79 \u00b1 126.55, \u03c7 (2) = 12.99, p = 0.0015). The remitted group demonstrated a significant improvement in productivity (particularly presenteeism) when compared with the new visit group (Z = -3.29, p = 0.001). Although the non-remitted group received treatment at psychiatric clinics similar to the remitted group, it lost 33 more working hours per month, which is compatible to $332 per month.

We investigated whether therapeutic approaches to bypass the cholesterol trafficking defect in NPC1 disease might delay disease progression in the npc1(-/-) mouse model. We show that the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) and T0901317, a synthetic oxysterol ligand, act in concert to delay onset of neurological symptoms and prolong the lifespan of npc1(-/-) mice. ALLO and T0901317 therapy preserved Purkinje cells, suppressed cerebellar expression of microglial-associated genes and inflammatory mediators, and reduced infiltration of activated microglia in the cerebellar tissue. To establish whether the mechanism of neuroprotection in npc1(-/-) mice involves GABA(A) receptor activation, we compared treatment of natural ALLO and ent-ALLO, a stereoisomer that has identical physical properties of natural ALLO but is not a GABA(A) receptor agonist. ent-ALLO provided identical functional and survival benefits as natural ALLO in npc1(-/-) mice, strongly supporting a GABA(A) receptor-independent mechanism for ALLO action. On the other hand, the efficacy of ALLO, ent-ALLO, and T0901317 therapy correlated with the ability of these compounds to activate pregnane X receptor-dependent pathways in vivo.

Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. Previous work has indicated that the most stable conformation for amiloride is a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic structure. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs. These analogs contained structural modifications which could be expected to allow or impede formation of a cyclized conformation. Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation.",

Since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs termed \"enhancer RNAs\" (eRNAs), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone \u03b1-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity. Knockdown of the more distal eRNA led to a drop in Cga mRNA levels, initially without effect on the forward eRNA levels. With time, however, the repression on the Cga increased, and the forward eRNA levels were suppressed also. We demonstrate that the interaction of the enhancer with the promoter is lost after eRNA knockdown. Dramatic changes also were seen in the chromatin, with an increase in total histone H3 occupancy throughout this region and a virtual loss of histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation at the promoter following the eRNA knockdown. Moreover, histone H3 Lys 27 (H3K27) acetylation, which was found at both enhancer and promoter in wild-type cells, appeared to have been replaced by H3K27 trimethylation at the enhancer. Thus, the Cga eRNA mediates the physical interaction between these genomic regions and determines the chromatin structure of the proximal promoter to allow gene expression.",

Our current understanding of the functions of miRNAs relies mainly on their tissue-specific or developmental stage-dependent expression and their evolutionary conservation, and therefore is primarily limited to their involvement in developmental regulation and oncogenesis. Of more than 300 miRNAs that have been identified, miR-1 and miR-133 are considered to be muscle specific. Here we show that miR-1 is overexpressed in individuals with coronary artery disease, and that when overexpressed in normal or infarcted rat hearts, it exacerbates arrhythmogenesis. Elimination of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis. miR-1 overexpression slowed conduction and depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane by post-transcriptionally repressing KCNJ2 (which encodes the K(+) channel subunit Kir2.1) and GJA1 (which encodes connexin 43), and this likely accounts at least in part for its arrhythmogenic potential.

However, the mechanisms of activation of microglia in neonatally BDV-infected rat brain have not been investigated. To address these issues, activation of primary rat microglial cells was studied following exposure to purified BDV or to persistently BDV-infected primary cortical neurons or after BDV infection of primary mixed neuron-glial cultures. Neither purified virus nor BDV-infected neurons alone activated primary microglia as assessed by the changes in cell shape or production of the proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, in the BDV-infected primary mixed cultures, we observed proliferation of microglia cells that acquired the round morphology and expressed major histocompatibility complex molecules of classes I and II. These manifestations of microglia activation were observed in the absence of direct BDV infection of microglia or overt neuronal toxicity. In addition, compared to uninfected mixed cultures, activation of microglia in BDV-infected mixed cultures was associated with a significantly greater lipopolysaccharide-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10.

The diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta usually depends on family history and clinical presentation characterized by a fracture (or fractures) during the prenatal period, at birth or in early childhood; genetic tests can confirm diagnosis. Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. In the past decade, (mostly) recessive, dominant and X-linked defects in a wide variety of genes encoding proteins involved in type I collagen synthesis, processing, secretion and post-translational modification, as well as in proteins that regulate the differentiation and activity of bone-forming cells have been shown to cause osteogenesis imperfecta. The large number of causative genes has complicated the classic classification of the disease, and although a new genetic classification system is widely used, it is still debated. Phenotypic manifestations in many organs, in addition to bone, are reported, such as abnormalities in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, skin fragility, muscle weakness, hearing loss and dentinogenesis imperfecta.

Diclofenac sodium alone also showed a significant change in these parameters compared with the control. Ultrastructural studies showed that doxorubicin causes apoptosis in myocardium, which was characterized by condensation of chromatin network at the margins of nuclear membrane.

BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is one the most common congenital intestinal disease. It leads to aganglionic megacolon in the early childhood. Several susceptibility genes have been identified : RET protooncogene and its ligand, glial cell derived neutrophic factor (GDNF), Sox 10, Endothelin-3 (EDN3) and its receptor B (EDNRB). EDNRB mutations are found in 5% of familial or sporadic HSCR. Only few EDNRB mutations found in HSCR have been explored and some of them seem to be non fonctional variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The properties of three mutant human endothelin B receptor (hETB) (G57S, R319W and P383L) in isolated HSCR were analyzed. Stable recombinant cells expressing the three mutants and the wild-type (WT) were established. The hETB receptors were characterized for 125I ET-1 binding, ET-1 induced signaling: calcium transient, AP-1 transcriptional factor activation and cAMP accumulation. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence experiments showed normal cellular distributions of the mutant G57S, R319W and WT hETB receptors. In contrast, the P383L hETB mutant receptor was concentrated near the nucleus and essentially no ET-1 binding was detected. The two other mutants (G57S and R319W) bound ET-1 normally, induced calcium transients and activated the AP-1 pathway in the same way as wild type, but did not inhibit adenylate cyclase. The G57S hETB mutant even stimulated cAMP accumulation which was blocked by pertussis toxin. CONCLUSION: The absence of the P383L mutant receptor from the membrane clearly indicates that this mutation could be involved in HSCR. The G57S and R319W mutant receptors, despite their normal coupling to Gaq, have a defect in the Galphai signaling pathway and the G57S mutation couples to Galphas. These observations allow us to hypothesize that cAMP signaling might be involved in the differenciation of neural cells in the bowel.",

OBJECTIVE: To systemically review the evidence in support of World Health Organization guidelines recommending broad-spectrum antibiotics for children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). METHODS: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, POPLINE, CAB Abstracts and ongoing trials registers were searched. Experts were contacted. Conference proceedings and reference lists were manually searched. All study types, except single case reports, were included. FINDINGS: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one before-and-after study and two retrospective reports on clinical efficacy and safety were retrieved, together with 18 pharmacokinetic studies. Trial quality was generally poor and results could not be pooled due to heterogeneity. Oral amoxicillin for 5\u00a0days was as effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for 2\u00a0days (1 RCT). For uncomplicated SAM, amoxicillin showed no benefit over placebo (1 retrospective study). The introduction of a standardized regimen using ampicillin and gentamicin significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized children (odds ratio, OR: 4.0; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-9.8; 1\u00a0before-and-after study). Oral chloramphenicol was as effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in children with pneumonia (1 RCT). Pharmacokinetic data suggest that normal doses of penicillins, cotrimoxazole and gentamicin are safe in malnourished children, while the dose or frequency of chloramphenicol requires adjustment. Existing evidence is not strong enough to further clarify recommendations for antibiotic treatment in children with SAM. CONCLUSION: Large RCTs are needed to define optimal antibiotic treatment in children with SAM with and without complications. Further research into gentamicin and chloramphenicol toxicity and into the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin is also required.",

Despite the scrutiny that has been directed for years at the yeast genome, relatively little is known about the impact of replication on the substitution dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. In addition, we found a mutational asymmetry associated with the polarity of replication resulting in higher rates of substitutions toward C and A than toward G and T in leading strands (reciprocally more substitutions toward G and T in lagging strands). Such mutational asymmetries applied over long evolutionary periods should generate compositional skews between the two DNA strands. Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands). We also show that the nucleotide frequencies at mutational equilibrium predict a compositional skew at equilibrium very close to the observed skew between leading and lagging strands, suggesting that compositional equilibrium has been nearly attained in the present day genome of S. cerevisiae. Surprisingly, the direction of this skew is inverted compared with the one in the human genome.",

INTRODUCTION: Angiogenesis activation plays a crucial role in tumoral growth and metastases dissemination. This review summarizes and analyzes current knowledge on molecular mechanisms related to angiogenesis and the prognostic value of its effectors. It also focuses on the therapeutical relevance of various drugs that might inhibit angiogenesic processes. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Tumor angiogenesis involves complex interactions between tumoral, stromal, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix. Normal and malignant angiogenesis depends on the balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. Endothelial cells are activated by growth factors, such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), and proliferate; they release proteases able to induce degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and undergo migration and tubulogenesis. Angiostatin and endostatin are two powerful inhibitors of angiogenesis in experimental models. Assessment of intratumoral microvessel density and quantification of angiogenic factors, including VEGF, are of prognostic value in most cancers, particularly in breast cancer. However, the use of these prognosis markers in clinical practice is still controversial due to the lack of prospective studies and to technical limits inherent to the scoring and standardization of immunohistochemical methods. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Better understanding of the molecular basis of angiogenesis allows the development of new therapeutical strategies. Biochemical targets of antiangiogenic therapy are: the interaction between angiogenic factors and their receptors; the interaction of endothelial cells with the extracellular matrix; and intracellular signaling pathways. Angiogenesis inhibitors may not cause tumor regression, but inhibit cellular growth and produce \"disease dormancy\". Extensive phase I to III clinical trials involving antiangiogenesis therapy are in progress.",

Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) is involved in the fibrotic response. Several muscular dystrophies are characterized by extensive fibrosis. However, the exact role of Ang-II in skeletal muscle fibrosis is unknown. Here we show that myoblasts responded to Ang-II by increasing protein levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), collagen-III and fibronectin. These Ang-II-induced pro-fibrotic effects were mediated by AT-1 receptors. Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. This increase in ROS is critical for Ang-II-induced fibrotic effects, as indicated by the decrease in Ang-II-induced CTGF and fibronectin levels by DPI and apocynin. We also show that Ang-II-induced ROS production and fibrosis require PKC activity as indicated by the generic PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. These results strongly suggest that the fibrotic response induced by Ang-II is mediated by AT-1 receptor and requires NAD(P)H-induced ROS in skeletal muscle cells.",

We previously reported that prostate derived Ets transcription factor (PDEF) is a breast tumor-associated molecule. To obtain further insights into PDEF expression in other human tumor types, a cDNA library database from human adult normal and tumor tissues was compiled and searched for PDEF distribution. The results showed that PDEF is present at relative higher frequencies in the cDNA libraries from brain, breast, lung and ovarian tumors in comparison to those from the corresponding normal tissues. RT/PCR analysis of PDEF expression in ovarian tumors confirmed that PDEF is expressed in 36 out of 51 (71%) ovarian tumors. Further comparison of the distribution of PDEF with other widely recognized cancer-associated molecules showed that PDEF has more restricted distributions than Her-2/neu, Bcl-2, survivin or telomerase in cDNA libraries from normal human tissues and more increased distribution than Her-2/neu, CA-125, Bcl-2, survivin and telomerase in cDNA libraries from brain (except survivin), breast, lung and ovarian tumors. These data together show a better tumor-association for PDEF and suggest that PDEF is a more suitable target for developing specific cancer therapies.",

The Q-rich domain of the mouse sex determining gene, Sry, is encoded by an in-frame insertion of a repetitive sequence composed of mostly CAG repeats. The exact function of this Q-rich domain is unknown. Studies on the polymorphisms within this Q-rich domain among different domesticus and musculus mouse strains suggest a possible role for this domain in sex determination. Using the farwestern protein-blotting technique and recombinant fusion proteins containing the Sry Q-rich domain as probes, three Sry interactive proteins of 94, 32 and 28 kDa apparent molecular weight (Sip-1, -2 and -3 respectively) were consistently detected in adult testis. Sip expression was detected in somatic cells and was associated with the spermatogenic activity of the testis. During embryogenesis, Sips were readily detected in total tissue extracts of embryos as early as E8.5 day. In fetal gonads of both sexes, their expression peaked around E11.5-13.5 day, at the time of sex determination and differentiation, and decreased drastically towards late stages of gestation. These observations support the hypothesis that the Q-rich domain may contribute to the biological function(s) of mouse Sry through a protein-protein interactive role(s).",

OBJECTIVE: To improve medulloblastoma proton therapy. Although considered ideal for proton therapy, there are potential disadvantages. Expected benefits include reduced radiation-induced cancer and circulatory complications, while avoiding small brain volumes of dose in-homogeneity when compared with conventional X-rays. Several aspects of proton therapy might contribute to reduced tumour control due to (a) the use of more homogenous dose levels which can result in under-dosage, (b) differences in relative biological effectiveness (RBE) between that prescription RBE of 1.1 and the RBE of brain and spinal cord (likely to exceed 1.1) and in medulloblastoma cells (where RBE is likely to be below 1.1). Such changes, although speculative for RBE, might result in potential underdosage of tumour cells and a higher bio-effect in brain tissue. METHODS: Dose distributions for X-ray and proton treatment are compared, with allocation of likely RBE values for fast growing medullolastoma cells and stable central nervous system tissue. RESULTS: These physical and radiobiological factors are shown to combine to give a higher risk of tumour recurrence with further risks on tumour control when dose reduction schedules used for X-ray therapy are replicated for proton therapy for \"low-risk\" patients. CONCLUSION: The dose distributions and prescribed doses of proton therapy, taking into account RBE, in children and adults with medulloblastoma, need to be reconsidered.",

To track more than one event in the same animal, fluorescent markers that clearly differ in their emission spectrum are needed. RESULTS: We established the transgenic Xenopus laevis strain tom3 that expresses ubiquitously red fluorescence from the tdTomato gene through all larval stages and in the adult animal. This new tool was applied to track transplanted blastemas obtained after tail amputation. The blastema can regenerate ectopic tails marked by red fluorescence in the host animal.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between serum thyroid hormone levels that are within the normal range and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients referred for coronary angiography. METHODS: In this observational study, we enrolled 119 consecutive patients (77 men, mean age 60.7\u00b113.8 years) who underwent coronary angiography. Blood samples were tested for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations. Additionally, risk factors, clinical characteristics and angiographic results were obtained. The patients were separated into two groups according to the Gensini score as those with mild or severe atherosclerosis. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, correlation and logistic regression tests, and ROC analysis. RESULTS: FT3 levels were significantly lower in subjects with CAD (4.0\u00b10.7 vs. 4.6\u00b10.6 pmol/L; p<0.001). Moreover, lower FT3 levels were found in patients with severe atherosclerosis (3.9\u00b10.7 vs. 4.5\u00b10.6 pmol/L; p<0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the lower FT3 levels were associated with the presence (OR =0.266, 95% CI: 0.097-0.731, p=0.01) and severity (OR=0.238, 95% CI:0.083-0.685, p=0.008) of CAD. In the ROC analysis, a level of FT3 < 4.2 pmol/L was found to predict the presence of CAD with 69% sensitivity and 71% specificity (AUC:0.744, 95% CI:0.653-0.834, p<0.001); and the severity of CAD with 75% sensitivity and 67% specificity (AUC:0.733, 95% CI:0.642-0.824, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely correlated with the presence and severity of CAD. Moreover, lower FT3 concentrations were correlated with the Gensini score and independently predicted the presence and severity of CAD.

As conventional treatments have shown only a modest impact on disease course, development of new therapeutic strategies based on the molecular biology of PDAC must be a high priority. The identification of relevant predictive and prognostic biomarkers which can be used to select patient subgroups that may benefit from conventional treatments and new targeted agents will be of considerable interest. We have demonstrated the ability of the metabolizing gemcitabine protein (the human Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 and the deoxycytidine kinase) in predicting the benefit of adjuvant gemcitabine-based therapy in resected PDAC patients. Beside these predictive biomarkers, we have evaluated different molecular factors that may impact on the likely course of this cancer. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 that has been shown to be implicated in PDAC tumorigenicity and aggressiveness could serve as a prognostic marker for survival after a curative-intent surgery and was associated with the pattern of tumour recurrence (distant versus local relapse). Our findings were validated in an independent cohort of patients. Overall our results suggested that (i) the benefit of an adjuvant gemcitabine-based therapy can be predicted based on the tumour expression of hENT1 and dCK, (ii) CXCR4 is an independent negative prognostic factor and an independent predictor of distant relapse suggesting that anti-CXCR4 targeting therapies can be a promising treatment in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.

The cylindromatosis gene (CYLD) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (Brooke-Spiegler syndrome), an autosomal-dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme acting as a negative regulator of the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway by removing lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from NF-\u03baB activating proteins. In order to investigate the role of CYLD in apoptotic signaling in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we first studied the expression levels of CYLD in HCC tissues. CYLD expression was lower in HCC both at protein and mRNA levels compared to the surrounding non-malignant tissue. In order to further study the role of CYLD in the apoptotic sensitivity of HCC cells, CYLD was specifically down-regulated in HCC cell lines via RNA interference. The specific down-regulation of CYLD resulted in increased resistance towards treatment with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. In addition, the down-regulation of CYLD in HCC cells decreased the sensitivity towards tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-induced apoptosis. The CYLD knockdown also led to the degradation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, I\u03baB-\u03b1, resulting in enhanced NF-\u03baB activity in HCC cells. Finally, we found that CYLD expression was triggered by the multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib, by the inhibition of Raf-1, as well as by the blockage of the pro-survival kinases, MEK (U0126) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (AG1478). In summary, we show that CYLD is down-regulated in human HCC and is involved in the apoptotic resistance of HCC cells. Our data identify the reconstitution of CYLD expression as an attractive approach for overcoming resistance to treatment in HCC.",

New evidence indicates that astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS) are extensively infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo. Although no new virus is produced, this nonproductive or restricted infection contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and compromises virus eradication strategies. The HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) plays a critical role in regulating virus production from infected cells. Here, we determined whether LTRs derived from CNS and non-CNS compartments are genetically and functionally distinct and contribute to the restricted nature of astrocyte infection. CNS- and/or non-CNS-derived LTRs (n=82) were cloned from primary HIV-1 viruses isolated from autopsy tissues of seven patients who died with HAD. Phylogenetic analysis showed interpatient and intrapatient clustering of LTR nucleotide sequences. Functional analysis showed reduced basal transcriptional activity of CNS-derived LTRs in both astrocytes and T cells compared to that of non-CNS-derived LTRs. However, LTRs were heterogeneous in their responsiveness to activation by Tat. Therefore, using a relatively large, independent panel of primary HIV-1 LTRs derived from clinically well-characterized subjects, we show that LTRs segregate CNS- from non-CNS-derived tissues both genetically and functionally. The reduced basal transcriptional activity of LTRs derived from the CNS may contribute to the restricted HIV-1 infection of astrocytes and latent infection within the CNS. These findings have significance for understanding the molecular basis of HIV-1 persistence within cellular reservoirs of the CNS that need to be considered for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1.",

CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. RLS severity and burden vary widely, and the condition may require long-term treatment. OBJECTIVE: To review the comparative effectiveness, efficacy, and safety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for RLS. DATA SOURCES: We searched bibliographic databases MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase, and Natural Standards through June 2012. REVIEW METHODS: Eligible efficacy studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of individuals with RLS published in English that lasted at least 4 weeks and compared pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments with placebo or active treatment. We assessed RLS symptom impact, sleep scale scores, disease-specific quality of life, withdrawals, and adverse effects. We included observational studies that assessed long-term (>6 months) treatment adverse effects and withdrawals. RESULTS: Of the 53 studies included, one active comparator and 33 placebo-controlled RCTs provided efficacy and harms data, and 18 observational studies assessed long-term harms and adherence. RCTs were typically small and of short duration, and enrolled adult subjects with severe primary RLS of long duration. Placebo-controlled RCTs (18 trials) demonstrated that dopamine agonists (pramipexole, rotigotine, ropinirole, and cabergoline) increased the percentage of subjects who had a clinically important response defined as \u226550 percent reduction from baseline in mean International RLS symptom scale scores (IRLS responders) (risk ratio [RR]=1.60; [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38 to 1.86], k=7), improved RLS symptom scores, patient-reported sleep scale scores (effect size=0.38; [95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46], k=8), and disease-specific quality of life (effect size=\u22120.37; [95% CI: \u22120.48 to \u22120.27], k=9). Dopamine agonists resulted in more patients who experienced at least one adverse event (high-strength evidence for all outcomes). Long-term augmentation (drug-induced worsening of symptoms) and treatment withdrawal were common. Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence). Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose reduced IRLS symptom scale scores versus placebo (k=1, moderate strength of evidence). Four studies assessed nonpharmacologic interventions. Compression stockings but not the botanical extract valerian improved IRLS symptom scale scores more than sham or placebo treatments. Strength of evidence was moderate for compression stockings and low for valerian. Exercise improved symptoms more than control (low-strength evidence). Near-infrared light treatment improved IRLS symptom scores more than sham (low-strength evidence). Two trials compared active treatments. In one small crossover trial, pramipexole and levodopa/benserazide resulted in similar improvements in IRLS scores (low-strength evidence). Cabergoline improved IRLS scores and resulted in less augmentation than levodopa (moderate-strength evidence). Iron improved symptoms in adults with iron deficiency (k=2) (low-strength evidence). No studies enrolled pregnant women, children, or those with end-stage renal disease. Withdrawal from mostly dopamine agonist and levodopa treatment at 1 year or more ranged from 13 to 57 percent. Treatment withdrawals were due to lack of efficacy (6% to 37%) as well as augmentation and other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, dopamine agonists and alpha-2-delta ligands reduce RLS symptoms and improve patient-reported sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life. Adverse effects of pharmacologic therapies and long-term treatment withdrawals due to adverse effects or lack of efficacy are common. Long-term effectiveness as well as applicability for adults with milder or less frequent RLS symptoms, individuals with secondary RLS, and children is unknown.",

Interference with these channels inhibits input from pain-sensing primary nociceptors. A recent clinical trial demonstrated that ziconotide has a significant analgesic effect compared to placebo in patients considered intolerant or refractory to other treatment such as systemic analgesics, adjunctive therapies, or intrathecal (IT) morphine. Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs. Ziconotide may represent another option for patients with refractory pain.",

Brucella abortus is a facultative, intracellular zoonotic pathogen which can cause undulant fever in humans and abortions in cattle. A 14-kDa protein of B. abortus was previously identified to be immunogenic in animals infected with Brucella spp. In this study, we discovered that the 14-kDa protein possessed immunoglobulin binding and hemagglutination properties that appeared to be based on the protein's lectin-like properties. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments suggested that the 14-kDa protein has affinity towards mannose. Disruption of the gene encoding the 14-kDa protein in virulent B. abortus strain 2308 induced a rough-like phenotype with an altered smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immunoblot profile and a significant reduction in the bacterium's ability to replicate in mouse spleens. However, the mutant strain was stably maintained in mouse spleens at 2.0 to 2.6 log(10) CFU/spleen from day 1 to week 6 after intraperitoneal inoculation with 4.65 log(10) CFU. In contrast to the case for the smooth virulent strain 2308, in the rough attenuated strain RB51 disruption of the 14-kDa protein's gene had no effect on the mouse clearance pattern. These findings indicate that the 14-kDa protein of B. abortus possesses lectin-like properties and is essential for the virulence of the species, probably because of its direct or indirect role in the synthesis of smooth LPS.",

Rises in intracellular Ca2+ induced by activation of glutamate receptors are of ultimate importance for neuronal excitability and pathophysiological processes. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the types of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels involved in the NMDA-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into the isolated rat retina by using selective blockers. Additionally, the number of binding sites for radioligands labelling L- ([3H]nitrendipine), N- ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIA) and P/Q-type ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIC) Ca2+ channels was assessed in the rat retina and, for further comparison, in the rat cortex. Incubation of isolated rat retinas with 100 microM NMDA produced a three-fold increase in the influx of 45Ca2+ that was completely blunted by MK-801, a NMDA receptor antagonist, and partially attenuated (approximately 20%) by tetrodotoxin, a Na+ channel blocker. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine reduced NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx in a dose-related fashion, with a maximum reduction of approximately 50%. Similar effects were observed with verapamil and diltiazem. Blockers of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels had no significant effect on the influx of Ca2+ evoked by NMDA. Co2+, a non-specific Ca2+ channel blocker, caused an inhibition of NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx similar to that of nifedipine. Therefore, of all voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, L-type channels appear to make the greatest contribution (up to 50%) to the NMDA-stimulated influx of Ca2+ into the isolated rat retina. This finding contrasts with evidence obtained in brain neurones supporting a role for L-, N- and P/Q-type channels in NMDA-evoked Ca2+ signals. A comparison of the number of radioligand binding sites associated with L-, N- or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in the rat cortex and retina revealed that such a difference cannot be ascribed to a distinct expression pattern of these channels in both tissues, although some variations were found. Interestingly, a different affinity of [3H]nitrendipine for L-type Ca2+ channels in the rat retina and cortex was observed which may reflect the expression of different classes of L-type channels in these tissues. The ability of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers to attenuate NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx may underlie their neuroprotective effects in the retina.",

OBJECTIVE: Peak incidence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) occurs in individuals aged 65 years and older. The goal was to evaluate the efficacy of carmustine wafers in prolonging survival for older GBM patients. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-three consecutive patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery for an intracranial primary (de novo) GBM from 1997-2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Among these 133 patients, 45 patients with carmustine wafer implantation were matched with 45 patients without implantation. These groups were matched for factors consistently shown to be associated with survival (age, Karnofsky performance scale, extent of resection, radiation therapy, and temozolomide). Survival was expressed as estimated Kaplan-Meier plots, and log-rank analysis was used to compare survival curves. Variables with P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean (\u00b1standard deviation) age of the cohort was 73\u00b15 years, and the median survival of the entire cohort was 5.9 months. Among patients with and without carmustine wafers, there were no significant differences in pre- and peri-operative variables. However, patients with carmustine wafers demonstrated prolonged survival as compared to patients without wafers. The median survival for patients with carmustine wafers was 8.7 months, while median survival for patients without wafers was 5.5 months (P=0.007). Likewise, in subgroup analysis, patients older than 70 years (P=0.0003) and 75 years (P=0.04) who had carmustine wafers had significantly longer survival than matched patients without wafers. DISCUSSION: Older patients with GBM may benefit from carmustine wafers.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhood. Recent studies have shown that CPVT is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) genes. Both proteins are key contributors to the intracellular Ca(2+) handling process and play a pivotal role in Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol during systole. Although the molecular pathogenesis of CPVT is not entirely clear, it was suggested that the CPVT mutations promote excessive sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak, which initiates delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered arrhythmias in cardiac myocytes. The recent breakthrough discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) generated from somatic cells (e.g. fibroblasts, keratinocytes) now enables researches to investigate mutated cardiomyocytes generated from the patient's iPSC. To this end, in the present article we review recent studies on CPVT iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, thus demonstrating in the mutated cells catecholamine-induced DADs and triggered arrhythmias.",

UNLABELLED: Many endocytic proteins accumulate in the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in synapses and relocalize to the endocytic periactive zone during neurotransmitter release. Currently little is known about their functions outside the periactive zone. Here we show that in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the endocytic scaffolding protein Dap160 colocalizes during the SV cycle and forms a functional complex with the SV-associated phosphoprotein synapsin, previously implicated in SV clustering. This direct interaction is strongly enhanced under phosphorylation-promoting conditions and is essential for proper localization of synapsin at NMJs. In a dap160 rescue mutant lacking the interaction between Dap160 and synapsin, perturbed reclustering of SVs during synaptic activity is observed. Our data indicate that in addition to the function in endocytosis, Dap160 is a component of a network of protein-protein interactions that serves for clustering of SVs in conjunction with synapsin. During the SV cycle, Dap160 interacts with synapsin dispersed from SVs and helps direct synapsin back to vesicles. The proteins function in synergy to achieve efficient clustering of SVs in the reserve pool. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We provide the first evidence for the function of the SH3 domain interaction in synaptic vesicle (SV) organization at the synaptic active zone. Using Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a model synapse, we describe the molecular mechanism that enables the protein implicated in SV clustering, synapsin, to return to the pool of vesicles during neurotransmitter release. We also identify the endocytic scaffolding complex that includes Dap160 as a regulator of the events linking exocytosis and endocytosis in synapses.",

PURPOSE: Retrospective study of patients treated for high-grade glioma, with or without biodegradable carmustine wafers and according to the Stupp protocol. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 2007 and June 2008, 65 patients underwent surgery for high-grade glioma, 28 had implantation of Gliadel and 37 patients did not. Patients received radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide followed by 5 consecutive days of temozolomide every month for 6 months. RESULTS: Overall median follow-up was 17.1 months; the median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 14 months with a RFS of 54% at 12 months, and 38% at 24 months. For patient with and without Gliadel, median and 1-year RFS were 12.9 months and 52% vs. 14 months and 42%, respectively (p = 0.89). According to pathology, Gliadel did not influence RFS of patients with Grade III or glioblastoma. However, for all patients, in multivariate analysis, non-methylated methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) was the only unfavorable prognostic factor of RFS (p = 0.017; HR 2.8; CI [1.2-7]). Median overall survival (OS) was 20.8 months; the OS rate at 12 months was 78.5%, and at 24 months 35.4%. For patients treated with and without Gliadel, median and 1-year OS were 20.6 months and 78.6% vs. 20.8 months and 78.4%, respectively. According to pathology, Gliadel did not influence OS of patients with Grade III or glioblastoma. For all patients, in multivariate analysis, unfavorable prognosticators for OS were non-methylated MGMT (p = 0.001; HR: 6.5; CI [2-20]) and irradiation dose <60 Gy (p = 0.02; HR: 6.3; CI [2-20]). With carmustine wafers, before irradiation, median gross tumor volume plus edema was 84 mL (27-229), whereas it was 68 mL (10-362) without carmustine (p = nonsignificant). Four cases of Grade 3 thrombopenia occurred, all in the carmustine wafer group. CONCLUSION: In patients with high-grade gliomas, adding Gliadel before performing a Stupp protocol did not improve survival.",

DESCRIPTION: Update of the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on genetic risk assessment and BRCA mutation testing for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on risk assessment,genetic counseling, and genetic testing for potentially harmful BRCA mutations in asymptomatic women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer but no personal history of cancer or known potentially harmful BRCA mutations in the family. The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery. POPULATION: This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer. RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing. (B recommendation)The USPSTF recommends against routine genetic counseling or BRCA testing for women whose family history is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Of these possible cardiovascular consequences, the association between OSA and hypertension has been found to be the most convincing. Although the exact mechanism has not been understood, there is some evidence that OSA is associated with frequent apneas causing mechanical effects on intrathoracic pressure, cardiac function, and intermittent hypoxemia, which may in turn cause endothelial dysfunction and increase in sympathetic drive. Therapy with continuous positive airway pressure has been demonstrated to improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics in patients with OSA and may reverse the endothelial cell dysfunction. Despite the availability of diagnostic measures and effective treatment, many patients with sleep-disordered breathing remain undiagnosed. Therefore, OSA continues to be a significant health risk both for affected individuals and for the general public.

The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting. Accordingly, we investigated the anticancer activity of the ACE inhibitor, captopril, in athymic mice injected with highly tumorigenic LNM35 human lung cells as xenografts. Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088). There were no undesirable effects of captopril treatment on animal behavior and body weight. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using cell viability and fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis tests, we demonstrated that captopril inhibited the viability of LNM35 cells by inducing apoptosis, providing insight about the mechanisms underlying its antitumorigenic activities. In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer.",

We have integrated and analyzed a large number of data sets from a variety of genomic assays using a novel computational pipeline to provide a global view of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; a.k.a.

Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of \u223c3-5 kb. The majority are up-regulated by short treatments with estradiol (i.e., 10, 25, or 40 min) with kinetics that precede or match the induction of the target genes. The production of eRNAs at ERBSs is strongly correlated with the enrichment of a number of genomic features that are associated with enhancers (e.g., H3K4me1, H3K27ac, EP300/CREBBP, RNA polymerase II, open chromatin architecture), as well as enhancer looping to target gene promoters. In the absence of eRNA production, strong enrichment of these features is not observed, even though ESR1 binding is evident. We find that flavopiridol, a CDK9 inhibitor that blocks transcription elongation, inhibits eRNA production but does not affect other molecular indicators of enhancer activity, suggesting that eRNA production occurs after the assembly of active enhancers. Finally, we show that an enhancer transcription \"signature\" based on GRO-seq data can be used for de novo enhancer prediction across cell types. Together, our studies shed new light on the activity of ESR1 at its enhancer sites and provide new insights about enhancer function.",

Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD, the familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene, as a negative regulator of proximal events in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Depletion of CYLD from cultured cells markedly enhances Wnt-induced accumulation of beta-catenin and target gene activation. Moreover, we demonstrate hyperactive Wnt signaling in human cylindroma skin tumors that arise from mutations in CYLD. At the molecular level, CYLD interacts with and regulates K63-linked ubiquitination of Dvl. Enhanced ubiquitination of the polymerization-prone DIX domain in CYLD-deficient cells positively links to the signaling activity of Dvl. Together, our results argue that loss of CYLD instigates tumor growth in human cylindromatosis through a mechanism in which hyperubiquitination of polymerized Dvl drives enhancement of Wnt responses.",

In this study, the SUMO-1 and Ubc9 genes were identified in the developing testis and ovary of Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, and designated EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated the expression level of both mRNAs varied significantly during testis and ovary development. In the testis, EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 were expressed at moderate levels in stage II-1, increased at stage II-2, and then gradually declined in stage IV. In the ovary, EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 expression were low in the early stage, reach the highest level at stage III-2, and then gradually decreased in stage IV.

Depressed Ca-handling in cardiomyocytes is frequently attributed to impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in human and experimental heart failure. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. This basic amino acid is important in maintaining the upstream consensus sequence for PKA phosphorylation of Ser 16 in PLN. To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse. Transgenic lines expressing mutant PLN-R14Del at similar protein levels to wild types exhibited no inhibition of the initial rates of oxalate-facilitated SR Ca uptake compared to PLN-knockouts (PLN-KO). The contractile parameters and Ca-kinetics also remained highly stimulated in PLN-R14Del cardiomyocytes, similar to PLN-KO, and isoproterenol did not further stimulate these hyper-contractile basal parameters. Consistent with the lack of inhibition on SR Ca-transport and contractility, confocal microscopy indicated that the PLN-R14Del failed to co-localize with SERCA2a. Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), but rather co-immunoprecipitated with the sarcolemmal Na/K-ATPase (NKA) and stimulated NKA activity. In addition, studies in HEK cells indicated significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer between PLN-R14Del-YFP and NKA\u03b11-CFP, but not with the NKA regulator phospholemman. Despite the enhanced cardiac function in PLN-R14Del hearts (as in PLN-knockouts), there was cardiac hypertrophy (unlike PLN-KO) coupled with activation of Akt and the MAPK pathways. Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity, leading to cardiac remodeling.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate fertility outcome after laparoscopic management of endometriosis in an infertile population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 64 patients presenting more than one year infertility and a pregnancy-wish associated with minimal to severe endometriotic lesions (stage I to IV according to the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) classification), treated using laparoscopic surgery in order to remove the entire lesions. We excluded women under 20 years and over 40, as well as those with other infertility factors (tubal non endometriosis-related, hormonal or sperm). Fertility of the remaining 34 patients was studied in relation to endometriosis stage and to pregnancy's mode (spontaneous or induced). RESULTS: Pregnant women percentage was 65% (22 patients) within a 8.5 months (quartiles: 3; 15.5) [range: 1; 52] post-surgical time, and 86.5% pregnancies issued with a delivery. The rate of pregnant women depended on stage of endometriosis (89% for stages I-II, and 56% for stages III-IV). Sixty percent pregnancies were spontaneous within a 5 months (3; 9) [1; 52] post-surgical time to pregnancy average. When pregnancies were obtained with assisted reproductive techniques, the median post-surgical time to pregnancy was 12 months (9; 22) [2; 31]. Among women with stages I-II endometriosis, the median post-surgical time to pregnancy was 2 months when spontaneous and 20.5 months when induced (P=0.007). In case of stages III-IV endometriosis, pregnancy's delay was 8 and 12 months respectively (P=0.79). Among the 21% women who had had an induced pregnancy failure before surgery, 71% became pregnant and 80% spontaneously. Eighteen patients (53%) had an ovarian endometrioma and 50% of them became pregnant. Among the 4 patients who had colorectal endometriosis requiring colorectal resection, 1 pregnancy was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a context of more than one year infertility only related to endometriosis, it is reasonable to offer these patients a complete operative laparoscopic treatment of their lesions, which enables 65% of them to be pregnant within a 8.5 months post-surgical median time to pregnancy and spontaneously in 60%. In case of stages I-II endometriosis we suggest a spontaneous pregnancy try during 8 to 12 months before starting induced pregnancy therapeutics instead of stages III-IV endometriosis where induced methods should be used after only 6 or 8 months.",

Mutations in the genes encoding the endothelin type-B receptor (EDNRB) and its physiological ligand endothelin 3 (EDN3) are now known to account for the majority of HSCR II patients. Null mutations in the mouse genes Ednrb and Edn3 have identified a key role for this pathway in the normal development of melanocytes and other neural crest-derived lineages. The pleiotropic effects of genes in this pathway, on melanocyte and enteric neuron development, have been clarified by the embryologic identification of their common neural crest (NC) ancestry. EDNRB and EDN3 are transiently expressed in crest-derived melanoblast and neuroblast precursors, and in the surrounding mesenchymal cells, respectively. The influence of EDNRB-mediated signaling on the emigration, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of melanocyte and enteric neuron precursors, in vivo and in vitro has recently been the subject of great scrutiny. A major emergent theme is that EDN3-induced signaling prevents the premature differentiation of melanocyte and enteric nervous system precursors and is essential between 10 and 12.5 days post-coitum. We review the present understanding of pigment cell development in the context of EDNRB/EDN3--a receptor-mediated pathway with pleiotropic effects.",

BACKGROUND: zfhz1b is the causative gene for Mowat-Wilson syndrome, in which patients demonstrate developmental delay and Hirschsprung disease, as well as other anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome who also developed cholestasis and histopathologic features consistent with biliary atresia, suggesting that mutations involving zfhz1b may lead to biliary developmental anomalies or injury to the biliary tract. We used the zebrafish model system to determine whether zfhx1b has a role in vertebrate biliary development. RESULTS: Using zebrafish we determined that zfhx1b was expressed in the developing liver during biliary growth and remodeling, and that morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of zfhx1b led to defects in biliary development. These findings were associated with decreased expression of vhnf1, a transcription factor known to be important in biliary development in zebrafish and in mammals. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies underscore the importance of genetic contributions in the etiology of infantile hepatobiliary disorders, including biliary atresia.",

Aberrant chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor CXCR4 expressions in malignant tissues have been reported, but its role in gastric cancer prognosis remains unknown. Our studies were designed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of CXCR4 in patients with gastric cancer. CXCR4 expression was retrospectively analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 97 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma from China. Results were assessed for association with clinical features and overall survival by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic values of CXCR4 expression and clinical outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. A molecular prognostic stratification scheme incorporating CXCR4 expression was determined by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that CXCR4 predominantly localized in the cell membranes and cytoplasm. The protein level of CXCR4 was upregulation in gastric cancer tissues and upregulated expression of CXCR4 was only significantly associated with Lauren classification (P<0.001). Increased CXCR4 expression in gastric cancer tissues was positively correlated with poor overall survival of gastric cancer patients (P<0.001). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that intratumoral CXCR4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for the disease. Applying the prognostic value of intratumoral CXCR4 density to TNM stage system showed a better prognostic value in patients with gastric cancer. In conclusion, intratumoral CXCR4 expression was recognized as an independent prognostic marker for the overall survival of patients with gastric cancer. On the basis of TNM stage, detection of CXCR4 expression will be helpful for predicting prognosis for patients with gastric cancer.",

All 43 exons of the Fanconi anaemia A (FANCA) gene were amplified from genomic DNA and screened for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. We identified four ethnic-specific mutations: (1) 2172-2173insG (exon 24), the first 'Moroccan mutation': (2) 4275delT (exon 43), the second 'Moroccan mutation'; (3) 890-893del (exon 10), the 'Tunisian mutation'; and (4) 2574C > G (S858R), the 'Indian mutation'.

The focal cerebral ischemia rat models were produced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. The MCAO group was further equally divided into five subgroups at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr, and the sham operated rats were used as controls. Serum ghrelin level was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and small intestinal motility was measured by methylene blue staining. The ileum tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy. The neurologic scores were 0 for all the rats in the control group and 2-3 for those in the MCAO group, suggesting that rat models were established successfully. The serum ghrelin level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). However, the impelling force in MCAO rats was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05), reaching the lowest level at 24 hr. Damage to the intestinal mucosa, including villus intestinalis, vacuolar degeneration of organelles, widened cell-cell junctions, and apoptotic cells could be found under the light and electron microscopy.

Alignment-free algorithms can be used to estimate the similarity of biological sequences and hence are often applied to the phylogenetic reconstruction of genomes. Most of these algorithms rely on comparing the frequency of all the distinct substrings of fixed length (k-mers) that occur in the analyzed sequences. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.",

UNLABELLED: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder in which haemolytic anaemia is the major symptom. The Beutler spot test employed in mass-screening for galactosaemia in newborns requires several intrinsic erythrocyte enzymes such as G6PD for its reaction and can theoretically detect G6PD deficiency apart from galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency. In this study, we detected two patients with G6PD deficiency using the quantitative Beutler test which was recently developed in our laboratory. Both patients lacked erythrocyte G6PD activity but exhibited no clinical symptoms. Molecular analysis in patients 1 and 2 revealed two novel missense mutations of C853T causing R285C and A1220C causing K407T, respectively. Molecular rather than enzymatic analysis was required in familial studies to detect and diagnose the carrier state. To date these patients have avoided oxidant stress and haemolytic diatheses have not been induced. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the quantitative Beutler test can detect glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency of class 1 and 2 and is therefore useful for early intervention and prevention of haemolytic diathesis in patients with this disorder.",

BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) dual infection (DI) has been associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads; however, the frequency of intrasubtype DI is poorly understood. We used ultradeep sequencing (UDS) to estimate the frequency of DI in a primary infection cohort of predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: HIV-1 genomes from longitudinal blood samples of recently infected, therapy-naive participants were interrogated with UDS. DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis. Coinfection was defined as DI at baseline; superinfection was monoinfection at baseline and DI at a later time point. RESULTS: Of 118 participants, 7 were coinfected and 10 acquired superinfection. Superinfection incidence rate was 4.96 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-9.22); 6 occurred in the first year and 4 in the second. Overall cumulative prevalence of intrasubtype B DI was 14.4% (95% CI, 8.6%-22.1%). Primary HIV-1 incidence was 4.37 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 3.56-5.36). CONCLUSIONS: Intrasubtype DI was frequent and comparable to primary infection rates among MSM in San Diego; however, superinfection rates declined over time. DI is likely an important component of the HIV epidemic dynamics, and development of stronger immune responses to the initial infection may protect from superinfection.",

Mature SV40 minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2).

The Bloom protein (BLM) and Topoisomerase IIIalpha are found in association with proteins of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, a disorder manifesting increased cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. In order to determine if the association reflects a functional interaction for the maintenance of genome stability, we have analyzed the effects of siRNA-mediated depletion of the proteins in human cells. Depletion of Topoisomerase IIIalpha or BLM leads to increased radial formation, as is seen in FA. BLM and Topoisomerase IIIalpha are epistatic to the FA pathway for suppression of radial formation in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks since depletion of either of them in FA cells does not increase radial formation. Depletion of Topoisomerase IIIalpha or BLM also causes an increase in sister chromatid exchanges, as is seen in Bloom syndrome cells. Human Fanconi anemia cells, however, do not demonstrate increased sister chromatid exchanges, separating this response from radial formation. Primary cell lines from mice defective in both Blm and Fancd2 have the same interstrand crosslink-induced genome instability as cells from mice deficient in the Fancd2 protein alone.

OBJECTIVES: To study the influence of female hormonal factors on the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in relation to the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 shared epitope (SE), the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) 1858T variant, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF). METHODS: A case-control study (1:4) was nested within the Medical Biobank of northern Sweden. Females who had subsequently developed RA (n = 70), median of 2.7 years before the onset of symptoms, and matched controls (n = 280) were identified from among the blood donors. A questionnaire concerning previous exposures until disease onset, including hormonal and reproductive factors, and smoking habits was distributed. RESULTS: Breastfeeding was significantly associated with the development of RA [odds ratio (OR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-15.8]. Increasing time of breastfeeding increased the risk of RA (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.83-17.95) for breastfeeding > 17 months. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, increasing time of breastfeeding (OR 9.5, 95% CI 2.14-42.43 for > 17 months), seropositivity for ACPAs (OR 19.5, 95% CI 4.47-84.81), and carriage of the PTPN22 1858T variant (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.36-7.54) remained significant predictors of RA. Users of oral contraceptives (OC) for > 7 years had a decreased risk for development of RA (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: A longer duration of breastfeeding increased the risk of developing RA, especially among individuals seropositive for ACPA or IgM-RF or carrying the PTPN22 1858T variant.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between serum concentrations of the immunoglobulin-like superfamily, selectins, hsCRP, and the development of DIND in patients with aneurysmal SAH. METHODS: Serum ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, L-selectin, and hsCRP were measured in 33 patients with SAH who underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Serum samples were obtained during the early period (day 0) and the late period (day 7). RESULTS: The serum concentrations of ICAM-1 (P = .009), VCAM-1 (P = .0383) and hsCRP (P = .0014) during the early period were significantly higher in patients with SAH than in control patients. Further, serum hsCRP concentration during the late period was significantly higher in patients with SAH than in control patients (P = 0033). Finally, serum concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and hsCRP during the early (P = .0055, P = .0266, and P = .0266) and late (P = .0423, P = .0041, and P = .0004) period were significantly higher in patients with DIND than in patients without DIND. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and hsCRP during the early and late period following SAH correlate with DIND.",

OBJECTIVE: Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are G-protein coupled receptors which maintain systemic calcium homeostasis and participate in hormone secretion, activation of ion channels, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Previous studies have shown that CaSRs induce apoptosis in isolated adult rat heart and in normal neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by G-protein-PLC-IP3 signaling transduction. However, little knowledge is presently available concerning the role of CaSRs in the apoptosis induced by ischemia and reperfusion in neonatal cardiomyocytes. METHODS: Primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were incubated in ischemiamimetic solution for 2 h, and then re-incubated in normal culture medium for 24 h to establish a model of simulated ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The expression of CaSRs mRNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the expressions of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: The simulated I/R enhanced the expression of CaSRs and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. GdCl3, a specific activator of CaSRs, further increased the expression of CaSRs and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, along with up-regulation of caspase-3 and down-regulation of Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: CaSRs are associated with I/R injury and apoptosis in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes via suppressing Bcl-2 and promoting caspase-3 expression.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke subtypes and prognosis differ among older black patients compared with whites; however, few data are available regarding stroke among young black patients. METHODS: To determine the risk factors for stroke, stroke subtype, and prognosis among young black patients, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all 15- to 44-year-old patients admitted with stroke to a university-affiliated public hospital from January 1990 through June 1994. RESULTS: Of the 248 eligible patients admitted with stroke, 219 were blacks. Hypertension was more frequently associated with stroke in young black than in non-black patients (55% versus 24%, P = .003). Cocaine abuse was frequent among both black and non-black patients (27% versus 38%, P = NS). Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (64%) was the most common subtype of intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 67), and lacunar infarction (21%) was the most common subtype of cerebral infarction (n = 112) in young black patients. Outcome in black patients with stroke at discharge was 69% independent, 8% dependent, and 23% dead. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of hypertension, hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and lacunar infarction among young black patients with stroke suggests accelerated hypertensive arteriolar damage, possibly due to poor control of hypertension.",

These extensions have raised questions about their ethical acceptability and the adequacy of regulatory structures to review new uses. This article describes current and likely future uses of PGD, and then analyses the ethical issues posed by new uses of PGD to screen embryos for susceptibility and late-onset conditions, for HLA-matching for tissue donation to an existing child, and for gender selection.

However, within the last two decades, there have been growing number of variants identified in genes that follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Our proband is a child born in Mexico with multiple fractures of ribs, minimal calvarial mineralisation, platyspondyly, marked compression and deformed long bones. He also presented with significant hydranencephaly, requiring ventilatory support from birth, and died at 8days of age. A homozygous c.338_357delins22 variant in exon 2 of SERPINH1 was identified. This gene encodes heat shock protein 47, a collagen-specific chaperone which binds to the procollagen triple helix and is responsible for collagen stabilisation in the endoplasmic reticulum. There is minimal literature on the mechanism of action for variants in SERPINH1 resulting in osteogenesis imperfecta.

Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are segments of >200 bp length showing absolute sequence identity between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes.

Recent studies have shown that UCEs function as long-range enhancers of flanking genes or are involved in splicing when overlapping with exons. The depletion of UCEs among copy number variation as well as the significant under-representation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within UCEs have also revealed their evolutional and functional importance indicating their potential impact on disease, such as cancer. In the present study, we investigated the influence of six SNPs within UCEs on familial breast cancer risk. Two out of six SNPs showed an association with familial breast cancer risk.

OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is the most frequently occurring and distressing symptom in patients with advanced cancer, caused by multiple factors. Neither a specific histological diagnosis of malignancy nor the type of anticancer treatment seem to be strongly related to fatigue, which support the idea that other factors may play a role. This study investigated to what extent the model of fatigue-perpetuating factors that is known for cancer survivors was applicable for patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Patients on active treatment for various incurable cancers were asked to complete the Checklist Individual Strength, subscale fatigue severity and physical activity, the Acceptance scale of the Illness Cognition Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Fatigue Catastrophizing Scale, the Symptom Checklist subscale sleep, and the van Sonderen Social Support List-Discrepancies. RESULTS: The questionnaires were filled in by 137 patients. Inappropriate coping, fear of progression, fatigue catastrophizing, discrepancies in social support, depressive mood, self reported physical activity, and sleeping problems were all related to fatigue severity in univariate analyses, of which the latter two were significant in a multivariate linear regression analysis. CONCLUSION: This study tested fatigue-perpetuating factors known to be of relevance in cancer survivors, for their relation with fatigue severity in palliative patients. We demonstrated that these factors were also relevant for patients on palliative treatment. On the basis of our results, we suggest clinicians confronted with palliative patients with serious fatigue to address sleeping problems and promote physical activity.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2 consecutive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, in patients undergoing first time isolated on-pump CABG between January 2000 and September 2004, 440 patients were recruited and randomized to either placebo (5% dextrose) (n=160), GIK (40% dextrose, K+ 100 mmol.L(-1), insulin 70 u.L(-1)) (0.75 mL.kg(-1) h(-1)) (n=157), T3 (0.8 microg.kg(-1) followed by 0.113 microg.kg(-1) h(-1)) (n=63) or GIK+T3 (n=60). GIK/placebo therapy was administered from start of operation until 6 hours after removal of aortic cross-clamp (AXC) and T3/placebo was administered for a 6-hour period from removal of AXC. Serial hemodynamic measurements were taken up to 12 hours after removal of AXC and troponin I (cTnI) levels were assayed to 72 hours. Cardiac index (CI) was significantly increased in both the GIK and GIK/T3 group in the first 6 hours compared with placebo (P<0.001 for both) and T3 therapy (P=0.009 and 0.029, respectively). T3 therapy increased CI versus placebo between 6 and 12 hours after AXC removal (P=0.01) but combination therapy did not. Release of cTnI was lower in all treatment groups at 6 and 12 hours after removal of AXC. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with GIK, T3, and GIK/T3 improves hemodynamic performance and results in reduced cTnI release in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery.

Expansion of a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat element within the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the human FMR1 gene is responsible for a number of heritable disorders operating through distinct pathogenic mechanisms: gene silencing for fragile X syndrome (>200 CGG) and RNA toxic gain-of-function for FXTAS (\u223c 55-200 CGG). Existing models have focused almost exclusively on post-transcriptional mechanisms, but co-transcriptional processes could also contribute to the molecular dysfunction of FMR1. We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand. Using DNA:RNA (hybrid) immunoprecipitation (DRIP) of genomic DNA from cultured human dermal fibroblasts with both normal (\u223c 30 CGG repeats) and premutation (55<CGG<200 repeats) alleles, we provide evidence for FMR1 R-loop formation in human genomic DNA. Using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible episomal system in which both the CGG-repeat and transcription frequency can be varied, we further show that R-loop formation increases with higher expression levels. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other R-loops. These observations introduce a new molecular feature of the FMR1 gene that is directly affected by CGG-repeat expansion and is likely to be involved in the associated cellular dysfunction.",

BACKGROUND: Wernicke's encephalopathy-Korsakoff syndrome (WE-KS) is common in alcoholics, caused by thiamine deficiency (TD; vitamin B1) and associated with lesions to the thalamus (THAL). Although TD alone can cause WE, the high incidence in alcoholism suggests that TD and ethanol (EtOH) interact. METHODS: Mice in control, TD, or EtOH groups alone or combined were studied after 5 or 10\u00a0days of treatment. THAL and entorhinal cortex (ENT) histochemistry and mRNA were assessed. RESULTS: Combined EtOH-TD treatment for 5\u00a0days (EtOH-TD5) showed activated microglia, proinflammatory gene induction and THAL neurodegeneration that was greater than that found with TD alone (TD5), whereas 10\u00a0days resulted in marked THAL degeneration and microglial-neuroimmune activation in both groups. In contrast, 10\u00a0days of TD did not cause ENT degeneration. Interestingly, in ENT, TD10 activated microglia and astrocytes more than EtOH-TD10. In THAL, multiple astrocytic markers were lost consistent with glial cell loss. TD blocks glucose metabolism more than acetate. Acetate derived from hepatic EtOH metabolism is transported by monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT) into both neurons and astrocytes that use acetyl-CoA synthetase (AcCoAS) to generate cellular energy from acetate. MCT and AcCoAS expression in THAL is lower than ENT prompting the hypothesis that focal THAL degeneration is related to insufficient MCT and AcCoAS in THAL. To test this hypothesis, we administered glycerin triacetate (GTA) to increase blood acetate and found it protected the THAL from TD-induced degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that EtOH potentiates TD-induced THAL degeneration through neuroimmune gene induction. The findings support the hypothesis that TD deficiency inhibits global glucose metabolism and that a reduced ability to process acetate for cellular energy results in THAL focal degeneration in alcoholics contributing to the high incidence of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in alcoholism.",

The concept of the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation comes from antiquity as rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore, (redness and swelling with heat and pain) extended later by functio laesa (loss of function). The contemporary understanding of this process we owe to 19th-century milestone discoveries by Rudolph Virchow, Julius Cohnheim and Elie Metchnikoff. In the 20th century, the development of potent technological tools allowed the rapid expansion of knowledge of the cells and mediators of inflammatory processes, as well as the molecular mechanisms of their interactions. It turned out that some mediators of inflammation have both local and distant targets, among them the liver (responding by the production of several acute phase reactants) and neurohormonal centers. In the last decades it has become clear that the immune system shares mediators and their receptors with the neurohormonal system of the body; thus, they form a common homeostatic entity. Such an integrative view, introduced by J. Edwin Blalock, when combined with Hans Selye's concept of stress, led to the contemporary understanding of sickness behavior, defined by Robert Dantzer as a highly organized strategy of the organism to fight infections and to respond to other environmental stressors.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 183 women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) associated with urethral hypermobility, underwent the T.O.T. procedure (October 2001 to March 2003). 26 patients were previously operated for incontinence. 26 patients were operated at the same time for their genital prolapse. Mean age was 56 years (29-87). 50/183 patients were having mixed incontinence. A non-elastic, polypropylene tape (UraTape, Mentor-Porg\u00e8s) with a silicon coated central part was placed under the mid-urethra. The surgical placement technique utilises a trans-obturator percutaneous approach. All patients underwent post-operative clinical examination, cough-stress test (full bladder), uroflowmetry, and post-voiding residual assessment. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 7 months (1-21). At 1 year follow-up 80.5% of the patients were completely cured and 7.5% were improved. The overall peri-operative complication rate was 2.2% with no vascular, nerve or bowel injury. 6 patients (3.3%) had post-operative urinary retention. CONCLUSION: The present multicentric study confirms the results obtained by the instigator of the technique, E. Delorme, and allows us to consider T.O.T. as an effective and safe technique for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence, alone or in combination with prolapse repair.",

Lung cancer is the most fatal cancer and development of agents that suppress lung tumorigenesis is a crucial strategy to reduce mortality related to this disease. In the present study, we showed, using an in vitro model of lung tumorigenesis, that dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), a water soluble parthenolide analog, selectively inhibited the growth and survival of premalignant and malignant cells with minimal effects on parental immortalized cells. These effects were paralleled by suppression of pSTAT3, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 and PARP cleavage, suggesting that the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of DMAPT could be mediated, at least in part, via suppression of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, in tobacco smoke carcinogen-induced lung tumor bioassay in mice, intranasal instillation of low doses of DMAPT significantly reduced the overall lung tumor multiplicity by 39%. Interestingly, the drug was specifically effective (62% reduction) against bigger lung tumors (> 2 mm), which have a higher potential to develop into lung adenocarcinoma. Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease.",

Hepatocyte growth factor modulates activation and antigen-presenting cell function of dendritic cells. However, the molecular basis for immunoregulation of dendritic cells by hepatocyte growth factor is undefined. In the current study, we demonstrate that hepatocyte growth factor exhibits inhibitory effect on dendritic cell activation by blocking I\u03baB kinase activity and subsequent nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. Inhibition of I\u03baB kinase is mediated by hepatocyte growth factor-induced activation of c-Src. Proximal signaling events induced in dendritic cells by hepatocyte growth factor include a physical association of c-Src with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-MET and concomitant activation of c-Src. Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. Blocking activation of c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin prevents hepatocyte growth factor-induced inhibition of I\u03baB kinase, nuclear factor-\u03baB and dendritic cell activation. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85\u03b1/p110\u03b1 and p85\u03b1/p110\u03b4, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of I\u03baB kinase and nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling.",

The biological significance of this negative feedback control loop has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Here we show that mice deficient in p100 but with constitutive expression of p52 in lymphocytes developed fatal lung inflammation characterized by diffuse alveolar damage with marked peribronchial fibrosis. In contrast, their littermates with only p100 deficiency or constitutive expression of p52 in lymphocytes developed mild lung inflammation with perivascular lymphocyte infiltration and had a normal life span. The fatal lung inflammation is associated with high-level induction of interferon-gamma and its inducible inflammatory chemokines, suggesting the involvement of a T-helper-1 immune response.

The injury severity impacts the overall outcome and likelihood for survival. Current treatment of acute TBI includes surgical intervention and supportive care therapies. Treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and optimizing cerebral perfusion are cornerstones of current therapy. These approaches do not directly address the secondary neurological sequelae that lead to continued brain injury after TBI. Depending on injury severity, a complex cascade of processes are activated and generate continued endogenous changes affecting cellular systems and overall outcome from the initial insult to the brain. Homeostatic cellular processes governing calcium influx, mitochondrial function, membrane stability, redox balance, blood flow and cytoskeletal structure often become dysfunctional after TBI. Interruption of this cascade has been the target of numerous pharmacotherapeutic agents investigated over the last two decades. Many agents such as selfotel, pegorgotein (PEG-SOD), magnesium, deltibant and dexanabinol were ineffective in clinical trials. While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending. Consequently, no neuroprotective treatment options currently exist that improve neurological outcome after TBI. Investigations to date have extended understanding of the injury mechanisms and sites for intervention. Examination of novel strategies addressing both pathological and pharmacological factors affecting outcome, employing novel trial design methods and utilizing biomarkers validated to be reflective of the prognosis for TBI will facilitate progress in overcoming the obstacles identified from previous clinical trials.",

To investigate the PTPN13 expression and its potential function in the invasion and metastasis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), we performed this study in 91 primary LSCC tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. METHODS: The mRNA expression of PTPN13 and FAK was quantitated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of PTPN13, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated FAK (P-FAK) was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. The association among PTPN13 expression, FAK expression and the clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: PTPN13 expression was down-regulated in LSCC, and was negatively correlated with the cancer grade and stage. FAK mRNA, as well as FAK protein level was elevated in LSCC tissues. P-FAK level, also found increased, had no association with FAK mRNA and FAK protein expression, but had a negative correlation with the PTPN13 expression.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship of depressive symptoms, satisfaction with health care, and 2-year work outcomes was examined in a national cohort of employees. METHOD: A total of 6,239 employees of three corporations completed surveys on health and satisfaction with health care in 1993 and 1995. This study used bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine the relationships of depressive symptoms (a score below 43 on the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey mental component summary), satisfaction with a variety of dimensions of health care in 1993, and work outcomes (sick days and decreased effectiveness in the workplace) in 1995. RESULTS: The odds of missed work due to health problems in 1995 were twice as high for employees with depressive symptoms in both 1993 and 1995 as for those without depressive symptoms in either year. The odds of decreased effectiveness at work in 1995 was seven times as high. Among individuals with depressive symptoms in 1993, a report of one or more problems with clinical care in 1993 predicted a 34% increase in the odds of persistent depressive symptoms and a 66% increased odds of decreased effectiveness at work in 1995.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to summarize results of recently published studies concerning clonidine application in paediatric anaesthesia, to analyse trends in these studies, and to discuss perspectives of the perioperative use of clonidine for children. RECENT FINDINGS: Reassessment of clonidine premedication has revealed that oral clonidine is inferior to midazolam for preoperative sedation. Oral or intravenous clonidine has been successfully used for the prevention of sevoflurane-induced agitation during emergence from anaesthesia. Peripheral injection or caudal (epidural) administration of clonidine prolonged the duration and enhanced the quality of postoperative analgesia by local anaesthetics without severe side effects. However, some negative results concerning potentiation of postoperative analgesia with clonidine have been reported. SUMMARY: Clonidine may be less favored than midazolam as premedication for children because of inferior clonidine-induced sedation. Additional comparative studies are required, however, to confirm this finding. On the other hand, clonidine-induced analgesia may well be useful and find wide application in paediatric anaesthesia. Prospective multicentre trials using a larger number of patients will be needed to verify the usefulness of caudal clonidine for postoperative pain relief. Prophylactic use of clonidine against sevoflurane-induced agitation may represent a new and promising application. Assessment of the efficacy of clonidine in potentiating regional anaesthesia/analgesia by local anaesthetics in children also needs more investigation. Moreover, it may be worthwhile to try new successful applications demonstrated in adults for paediatric anaesthesia.",

AIM: To compare the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and duration of remission after oral vs. bath PUVA using 8-MOP in patients with chronic palmoplantar eczema. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were randomly allocated to treatment with oral or bath PUVA. Treatment was given thrice weekly for a maximum of 20 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in eczema score at the end of treatment. After clearing patients were followed up until relapse or up to 40 months. RESULTS: Overall, both PUVA modalities appeared comparably effective. However, after stratifying according to eczema type, significant differences in therapeutic outcome in general as well as in response to the two regimes were found. Dyshidrotic eczema responded better to both treatments (P=0.048) and remained longer in remission than hyperkeratotic eczema.

BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemic damage is reduced by volatile anaesthetics in patients undergoing low-risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery; few and discordant results exist in other settings. We therefore performed a randomised controlled trial (sevoflurane vs. propofol) to compare cardiac troponin release in patients with coronary disease undergoing mitral surgery. METHODS: Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing mitral surgery were randomly allocated to receive either sevoflurane (50 patients) or propofol (50 patients) as main hypnotic. The primary endpoint of the study was peak post-operative cardiac troponin release defined as the maximum value among the post-operative values measured at intensive care unit arrival, 4 h later, on the first and second post-operative day. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in post-operative peak troponin release, the median (25th-75th percentiles) values being 14.9 (10.1-22.1) ng/ml and 14.5 (8.8-17.6) ng/ml in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively (P = 0.4).

The 1-year follow-up identified two patients who died in the propofol group (one myocardial infarction and one low cardiac output syndrome) and one in the sevoflurane group (myocardial infarction). CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with coronary artery disease undergoing mitral surgery did not benefit from the cardioprotective properties of halogenated anaesthetics.

Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). Morphine is an agonist of mu-opioid receptors and inhibits N-type VSCC channels via a G-protein coupling mechanism. Both agents are antinociceptive when they are administered intrathecally (spinally). The present study investigated the acute and chronic (7-day) interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide and morphine on nociception in several animal models of pain. In the acute study, intrathecal bolus injections of morphine and ziconotide alone produced dose-dependent inhibition of formalin-induced tonic flinch responses and withdrawal responses to paw pressure. The combination of ziconotide and morphine produced an additive inhibition of formalin-induced tonic flinch responses and a significant leftward shift of the morphine dose-response curve in the paw pressure test. After chronic (7-day) intrathecal infusion, ziconotide enhanced morphine analgesia in the formalin test. In contrast, chronic intrathecal morphine infusion produced tolerance to analgesia, but did not affect ziconotide antinociception. Antinociception produced by ziconotide alone was the same as that observed when the compound was co-administered with morphine to morphine-tolerant rats. In the hot-plate and tail immersion tests, chronic intrathecal infusion of morphine lead to rapid tolerance whereas ziconotide produced sustained analgesia with no loss of potency throughout the infusion period. Although ziconotide in combination with morphine produced an apparent synergistic analgesic effects during the initial phase of continuous infusion, it did not prevent morphine tolerance to analgesia. These results demonstrate that (1) acute intrathecal administrations of ziconotide and morphine produce additive or synergistic analgesic effects; (2) chronic intrathecal morphine infusion results in tolerance to analgesia but does not produce cross-tolerance to ziconotide; (3) chronic intrathecal ziconotide administration produces neither tolerance nor cross-tolerance to morphine analgesia; (4) intrathecal ziconotide does not prevent or reverse morphine tolerance.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to review current perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and current treatment guidelines for this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of CRS in CKD include neurohumoral, haemodynamic and CKD-related mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that sympathetic nerve activity plays a role in CRS, but the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial failed to show a reduction of blood pressure after catheter-based renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension. Kidney injury in patients with heart failure was previously considered to result from arterial underfilling due to low cardiac output, but the role of renal venous hypertension in this process has also recently been investigated. It would be useful to develop a reliable treatment option for CRS due to haemodynamic mechanism other than volume control using diuretics. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a phosphaturic hormone that has recently been identified as a CKD-related factor affecting CRS. FGF23 treatment has both advantages and disadvantages in terms of CRS progression. SUMMARY: Multiple disorders underlie the development of CRS. Current treatment options include renin-angiotensin system blockade and volume control, but remain limited. A multidisciplinary approach is required to prevent CRS, including renal sympathetic denervation, treatment of renal venous hypertension and FGF23 treatment.",

CASE: A patient presented with a fetus with large nuchal translucency and ambiguous genitalia at 13 weeks of gestation. Conventional fetal karyotype by chorionic villus sampling was 46,XY,inv (1)(p31q42). The inversion was de novo. Further analysis by array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a single-copy ZEB2 gene deletion at 2q22.3 consistent with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Ultrasonography at 17 weeks revealed a reduced nuchal fold of 5 mm. The patient decided to terminate the pregnancy, which was completed uneventfully at 17 weeks of gestation.

OBJECTIVES: Fetal sex determination is performed for women who carry X-linked conditions, for example Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), or those associated with ambiguous genitalia, for example congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is an alternative to invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD), which carries a 1% risk of miscarriage. This study aimed to evaluate the incremental cost of NIPD compared with IPD of fetal sex. METHODS: Diagnostic accuracy, invasive testing rate, and pregnancy outcome following NIPD were ascertained from an audit of all cases referred to two laboratories in 2006 to 2009. Care pathways for DMD and CAH were established and key cost drivers for IPD and NIPD identified using costs derived from published estimates and local laboratory values. RESULTS: The differences in mean costs per pregnancy for NIPD versus IPD were small for DMD [mean difference - \u00a387, 95% confidence interval (CI) - \u00a3303 to \u00a3131] and CAH (-\u00a3193, 95% CI - \u00a3301 to - \u00a384). Testing costs associated with NIPD were offset by fewer women requiring invasive testing. CONCLUSIONS: The costs of NIPD and IPD of fetal sex are similar. NIPD can provide benefits for many women by avoiding the risks of invasive testing, without incurring additional costs.",

We have used frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the structural linkage between the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the regulatory protein phospholamban (PLB). Using an engineered PLB having a single cysteine (Cys(24)) derivatized with the fluorophore N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PMal), we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the average spatial separation and conformational heterogeneity between PMal bound to Cys(24) in the transmembrane domain and Tyr(6) in the cytosolic domain near the amino terminus of PLB. In these measurements, PMal serves as a FRET donor, and Tyr(6) serves as a FRET acceptor following its nitration by tetranitromethane. The native structure of PLB is retained following site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification, as indicated by the ability of the derivatized PLB to fully regulate the Ca-ATPase following their co-reconstitution. To assess how phosphorylation modulates the structure of PLB itself, FRET measurements were made following reconstitution of PLB in membrane vesicles made from extracted sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane lipids. We find that the cytosolic domain of PLB assumes a wide range of conformations relative to the transmembrane sequence, consistent with other structural data indicating the presence of a flexible hinge region between the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of PLB. Phosphorylation of Ser(16) by PKA results in a 3 A decrease in the spatial separation between PMal at Cys(24) and nitroTyr(6) and an almost 2-fold decrease in conformational heterogeneity, suggesting a stabilization of the hinge region of PLB possibly through an electrostatic linkage between phosphoSer(16) and Arg(13) that promotes a coil-to-helix transition. This structural transition has the potential to function as a conformational switch, since inhibition of the Ca-ATPase requires disruption of the secondary structure of PLB in the vicinity of the hinge element to permit association with the nucleotide binding domain at a site located approximately 50 A above the membrane surface. Following phosphorylation, the stabilization of the helical content in the hinge domain will disrupt this inhibitory interaction by reducing the maximal dimension of the cytosolic domain of PLB. Thus, stabilization of the structure of PLB following phosphorylation of Ser(16) is part of a switching mechanism, which functions to alter binding interactions between PLB and the nucleotide binding domain of the Ca-ATPase that modulates enzyme inhibition.",

SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) conjugation is a post-translational modification implicated in a variety of cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, nuclear location and signal transduction. Sumoylation, although conserved and vital in eukaryotes, has not been studied in malaria parasites. Here, we identify SUMO conjugation of blood stage parasites of Plasmodium falciparum. Antibodies raised against synthetic peptides of the plasmodial SUMO orthologue PfSUMO, a 100-amino-acid protein, reacted with distinctive subcellular compartments of the parasitized erythrocyte during blood stage development. Anti-PfSUMO stains the nucleus and parasite cytoplasm. We also found antibody reactivity in the host cell cytoplasm with the parasite-derived structures called Maurer's clefts. Anti-PfSUMO reacts in Western blot with a number of blood stage proteins ranging from approximately 40-250 kDa. Parasites expressing FLAG-tagged PfSUMO gave similar results in Immunofluorescence assay and Western blots. In addition, we show that anti-PfSUMO identified PfSir2, a telomere-associated nuclear protein involved in var gene silencing, as a target for sumoylation. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS analysis of a two-step immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG and anti-PfSUMO antibodies reveals a number of putative P. falciparum sumoylated proteins.

BACKGROUND: Thalidomide is an anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic drug currently used for the treatment of several diseases, including erythema nodosum leprosum, which occurs in patients with lepromatous leprosy. In this research, we use DNA microarray analysis to identify the impact of thalidomide on gene expression responses in human cells after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. We employed a two-stage framework. Initially, we identified 1584 altered genes in response to LPS. Modulation of this set of genes was then analyzed in the LPS stimulated cells treated with thalidomide. RESULTS: We identified 64 genes with altered expression induced by thalidomide using the rank product method. In addition, the lists of up-regulated and down-regulated genes were investigated by means of bioinformatics functional analysis, which allowed for the identification of biological processes affected by thalidomide. Confirmatory analysis was done in five of the identified genes using real time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed some genes that can further our understanding of the biological mechanisms in the action of thalidomide.

BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis, among other signaling pathways, plays a key-role in sarcoma biology. Regorafenib (RE) has recently been shown to be effective in imatinib and sunitinib-refractory GIST in a phase III trial. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting an international trial (France, Austria and Germany) consisting in 4 parallel double-blind placebo-controlled randomized (1/1) phase II trials to assess the activity and safety of RE in doxorubicin-refractory STS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01900743). Each phase II trial is dedicated to one of the 4 following histological subgroups: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other sarcoma. Within each randomized trial the following stratification factors will be applied: countries and prior exposure to pazopanib. Key-eligibility criteria are: measurable disease, age > 18, not > 3 previous systemic treatment lines for metastatic disease, metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) according to central radiological review. Secondary endpoints are: Toxicity (NCI-CTC AE V4.0); time to progression; Growth modulation index in pts receiving RE after randomization; 3 and 6 months PFS-Rates, best response rate and overall survival. Each phase II trial will be separately analyzed. In 3 trials, statistical assumptions are: PFS0 = 1.6 & PFS1 = 4.6 months; 1-sided \u03b1 = 0.1; \u03b2 = 0.05 with a total sample size of 192 pts. To take into account the rarity of synovial sarcoma, the statistical assumptions are: PFS0 = 1.6 & PFS1 = 4.6 months; 1-sided \u03b1 = 0.1; \u03b2 = 0.2 Tumor assessment is done monthly during the 4 first months, and every 3 months thereafter. After central radiological confirmation of tumor progression, an optional open-label option is offered to eligible patients. DISCUSSION: The design of this trial allows an assessment of regorafenib activity over placebo in four sarcoma strata and might provide evidence for launching a phase III trial.

The variation of recombination rate at both fine and large scales cannot be fully explained by DNA sequences alone. Epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, have recently been proposed to influence the variation in recombination rate. RESULTS: We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets\u00a0(Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate\u00a0valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate\u00a0valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate\u00a0valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid, is a HDAC inhibitor and is produced in the colonic lumen as a consequence of microbial degradation of dietary fibers. In order to dissect out the mechanism of NaB-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells, we carried out expression profiling of a human lung carcinoma cell line (H460) treated with NaB using a cDNA microarray. Of the total 1728 genes analysed, there were 32 genes with a mean expression value of 2.0-fold and higher and 66 genes with a mean expression value 3.0-fold and lower in NaB-treated cells. For a few selected genes, we demonstrate that their expression pattern by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is matching with the results obtained by microarray analysis. Closer view at the expression profile of NaB-treated cells revealed the downregulation of a total of 16 genes associated with cytokine signaling, in particular, interferon gamma (IFNgamma) pathway. In good correlation, NaB-pretreated cells failed to induce interferon regulatory factor 1, an INFgamma target gene, efficiently upon IFNgamma addition. These results suggest that NaB inhibits proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway, thus providing proof of mechanism for its anti-inflammatory activity. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote metastasis. Upregulation of metastatic suppressor Kangai 1 (KAI1) by NaB in a time-dependent manner was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The differential regulation of metastasis-associated genes by NaB provides explanation for the anti-invasive properties of NaB. Therefore, our study presents new evidence for pathways regulated by NaB, thus providing evidence for the mechanism behind anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of NaB.",

BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated a 3-week schedule of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). METHODS: Patients received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks and were evaluated every 6 weeks until tumor progression. Tissue correlates were used to quantify tumor content of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2). RESULTS: Of 61 patients who were treated (35 men and 26 women; median age, 52 years; age range, 21-78 years), 50 patients had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and 11 patients had anaplastic glioma (AG). The median number of previous chemotherapies was 2 (range, 1-5 previous chemotherapies), and 16 patients had received > 3 previous chemotherapies. The median number of bevacizumab doses was 4 (range, 1-20 doses), and 45% of patients received >5 doses. The toxicities observed were primarily grade 1 and 2, and the most common were fatigue, hypertension, and headache. One grade 2 intratumoral bleed and 1 bowel perforation were reported. For patients with GBM, the 6-month progression-free survival rate was 25%, the median time to tumor progression was 10.8 weeks, and the median overall survival was 25.6 weeks. The best response included a partial response in 15 patients (24.5%) and stable disease in 31 patients (50.8%) patients; radiographic recurrence patterns included increased changes in fluid attenuation inversion recovery (24%) and multifocal recurrence (20%). The median survival after bevacizumab failure was 10 weeks. The ratio of tumor VEGFA/VEGFR2 was increased in patients aged >55 years; an increased VEGFA/VEGFR2 ratio was correlated nonsignificantly with decreased survival (P = .052). CONCLUSIONS: An every-3-week schedule of bevacizumab had antitumor activity and was relatively nontoxic for patients with recurrent HGG. The predictive value of VEGFA/VEGFR2 in tumor will require validation in a larger patient cohort.",

INTRODUCTION: Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in postmenopausal women. AIM: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ospemifene for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. The search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six publications involving a total of 1,772 patients were used in the analysis, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were short-term (12 weeks) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo and three RCTs that were long-term (1 year) comparisons of ospemifene with placebo. RESULTS: For the comparison of short-term ospemifene with placebo, parabasal cells (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = -37.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI = 7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001) indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo. For the comparison of long-term ospemifene with placebo, endometrial thickness (SMD = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.58 to 1.23, P = 0.00001), treatment emergent adverse event, discontinuations due to adverse event, and serious adverse event indicated that ospemifene was generally safe.

BACKGROUND: The severity and dysmorphology that results from the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures is not uniform. Less striking phenotypes may be more easily missed on routine screening, possibly leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare the age at initial presentation for the different forms of craniosynostosis. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of all patients who underwent open craniofacial repair of craniosynostosis at a single institution from 1996 to 2009. Relationships between type of suture fusion and age at initial consultation were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred eleven patients (136 males, 75 females) were identified. Indications included sagittal (n = 96), metopic (n = 39), unicoronal (n = 33), bicoronal (n = 24), multisutural (n = 15), bilambdoidal (n = 3), and unilambdoidal (n = 1) synostoses. Seventeen patients (8.1%) had a craniosynostosis syndrome and 5 (2.4%) had a syndrome or disorder not typically associated with craniosynostosis [X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (n = 3), achondroplasia (n = 1), and Beckwith Wiedemann (n = 1)]. Median age at initial consultation was 4.1 months; there was no gender difference. Patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets presented at a significantly older age than nonsyndromic patients or those with a known craniosynostosis syndrome. Those with multisutural synostosis presented at a significantly older age than patients with sagittal or bicoronal synostosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with multisutural involvement or X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets had a significant delay in presentation for craniosynostosis. The latter group of patients may especially benefit from routine surveillance for craniosynostosis given their advanced age at diagnosis.",

A loss-of-function mutation in PHEX disrupts this interaction leading to hypophosphatemic rickets.

A clinical report of a patient with XLH rickets and craniosynostosis is presented with a review of literature. A review of physiology of bone mineralization reveals that, at high levels, there is cross-binding of FGF23 with FGF receptors 2 and 3 at the cranial sutures. This may be the reason for the common association of craniosynostosis and XLH rickets.

METHODS: Serum HCV RNA from patients who experienced viral breakthrough, partial response, or nonresponse in 2 clinical trials in which patients received mericitabine plus peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD)/ribavirin were analyzed by population and clonal sequence analysis as well as phenotypic assay for assessment of in vivo mericitabine resistance. RESULTS: Among 405 patients treated with mericitabine plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in PROPEL and JUMP-C, virologic breakthrough or nonresponse were not observed; 12 patients experienced a partial response. The NS5B S282T resistance mutation was not observed in any patient. A number of treatment-associated NS5B changes were observed and characterized. A novel double mutant (L159F/L320F) with impaired replication capacity was detected in one HCV genotype 1b-infected patient.

Recent years have seen an explosion of research into increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. Arimoclomol (BRX-220), being developed by CytRx Corp, is an oral therapeutic candidate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease. ALS is a fatal, incurable disorder, which can present as sporadic (90 to 95% of cases) or familial (5 to 10% of cases) forms. The etiology of sporadic ALS remains unknown and much of the understanding of ALS pathogenesis has been derived through study of its familial forms; in particular, through study of autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase) gene, which cause approximately 20% of familial ALS cases. Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after symptom onset. Clinical trials have reported good tolerability and safety. This paper discusses the rationale for arimoclomol use in ALS, the preclinical and clinical evidence collected to date, the likelihood of its promising preclinical results translating to humans, and the relevance of this research for neurodegeneration as a whole.",

Mammalian DNA replication starts at distinct chromosomal sites in a tissue-specific pattern coordinated with transcription, but previous studies have not yet identified a chromatin modification that correlates with the initiation of DNA replication at particular genomic locations. Here we report that a distinct fraction of replication initiation sites in the human genome are associated with a high frequency of dimethylation of histone H3 lysine K79 (H3K79Me2). H3K79Me2-containing chromatin exhibited the highest genome-wide enrichment for replication initiation events observed for any chromatin modification examined thus far (23.39% of H3K79Me2 peaks were detected in regions adjacent to replication initiation events). The association of H3K79Me2 with replication initiation sites was independent and not synergistic with other chromatin modifications. H3K79 dimethylation exhibited wider distribution on chromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2 were enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication although most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the absence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect regulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates with some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to prevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability.",

These signaling pathways play critical roles in controlling gene transcription during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We hypothesized that NF1 mutations disturb the expression of genes important for memory formation. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA microarray analysis on the hippocampus of NF1(+/-) mice, the mouse model for NF1 learning disabilities. Our results indicated that genes involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes are dysregulated in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. Many of the NF1-affected genes play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, such as Rabs, synaptotagmins, NMDAR1, CaMKII, and CREB1. Because NF1-associated learning disabilities can be reversed by lovastatin, we also determined the effect of lovastatin treatment on genome-wide expression patterns of the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. We found that lovastatin altered the expression of a large number of genes, including those disturbed by NF1 mutations.

Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, functioning to modulate contractile force by altering the rate of calcium re-sequestration by the Ca-ATPase. Functionally, inhibition by PLB binding is manifested by shifts in the calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation toward higher calcium levels; phosphorylation of PLB by PKA reverses the inhibitory action of PLB. To investigate structural changes in the cytoplasmic portion of PLB that result from either the phosphorylation of PLB by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or calcium binding to the Ca-ATPase, we have used frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the spatial separation and conformational heterogeneity between N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide, covalently bound to a single cysteine (Cys(24)) engineered near the membrane surface of the transmembrane domain of PLB, and Tyr(6) in the cytosolic domain. Irrespective of calcium activation of the Ca-ATPase or phosphorylation of Ser(16) in PLB by PKA, we find that PLB remains tightly associated with the Ca-ATPase in a well-defined conformation. However, calcium activation of the Ca-ATPase induces an increase in the overall dimensions of the cytoplasmic portion of bound PLB, whereas PLB phosphorylation results in a more compact structure, consistent with increased helical content induced by a salt link between phospho-Ser(16) and Arg(13). Thus, enzyme activation of the Ca-ATPase may occur through different mechanisms: calcium binding to high-affinity sites within the Ca-ATPase functions to overcome conformational constraints imposed by PLB on the N-domain of the Ca-ATPase; alternatively, phosphorylation stabilizes the backbone fold of PLB to release inhibitory interactions with the Ca-ATPase.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 19 patients with IH treated with propranolol was conducted from January 2009 to March 2014. Data of individual IH volume at the beginning and at least 6 months after the onset of treatment and overall volume reduction by ultrasonographic measurement were obtained. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant IH volume reduction of approximately 0.51 cm . This volume corresponds to an average reduction of 47% in the final volume compared with the initial volume. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonographic measurements contribute to demonstrate tumor regression and IH response to propranolol. Thus, ultrasonography is an important instrument to guide therapeutic strategies.",

Smad4 is an essential signal transducer of all transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation, and it becomes inactivated in human cancers. Receptor-activated (R-) Smads can be poly-ubiquitinated in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, and this regulates their steady state levels or shutdown of the signaling pathway. Oncogenic mutations in Smad4 and other Smads have been linked to protein destabilization and proteasomal degradation. We analyzed a panel of missense mutants derived from human cancers that map in the N-terminal Mad homology (MH) 1 domain of Smad4 and result in protein instability. We demonstrate that all mutants exhibit enhanced poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In contrast, wild type Smad4 is a relatively stable protein that undergoes mono- or oligo-ubiquitination, a modification not linked to protein degradation. Analysis of Smad4 deletion mutants indicated efficient mono- or oligo-ubiquitination of the C-terminal MH2 domain. Mass spectrometric analysis of mono-ubiquitinated Smad4 MH2 domain identified lysine 507 as a major target for ubiquitination. Lysine 507 resides in the conserved L3 loop of Smad4 and participates in R-Smad C-terminal phosphoserine recognition. Mono- or oligo-ubiquitinated Smad4 exhibited enhanced ability to oligomerize with R-Smads, whereas mutagenesis of lysine 507 led to inefficient Smad4/R-Smad hetero-oligomerization and defective transcriptional activity. Finally, overexpression of a mutant ubiquitin that only leads to mono-ubiquitination of Smad4 enhanced Smad transcriptional activity. These data suggest that oligo-ubiquitination positively regulates Smad4 function, whereas poly-ubiquitination primarily occurs in unstable cancer mutants and leads to protein degradation.",

PURPOSE: To improve the prognosis of patients with poor-risk peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs; including peripheral neuroepithelioma and Ewing's sarcoma), while testing the feasibility of intensive use in adolescents and young adults of high-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (HD-CAV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report concerns previously untreated patients with newly diagnosed pPNET deemed poor-risk because of a tumor volume more than 100 cm3 or metastases to bone or bone marrow. The P6 protocol consists of seven courses of chemotherapy. Courses 1, 2, 3, and 6 include 6-hour infusions of cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 2 for a total of 4,200 mg/m2 per course (140 mg/kg per course for patients < 10 years old), plus 72-hour infusions of doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 and vincristine 2.0 mg/m2 beginning on day 1 (HD-CAV). Courses 4, 5, and 7 consist of 1-hour infusions of ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2/d and etoposide (VP-16) 100 mg/m2/d, for 5 days. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and mesna are used. Courses start after neutrophil counts reach 500/microL and platelet counts reach 100,000/uL. Surgical resection follows course 3 and radiotherapy follows completion of all chemotherapy. RESULTS: Among the first 36 consecutive assessable patients (median age, 17 years), HD-CAV achieved excellent histopathologic or clinical responses in 34 patients and partial responses (PRs) in two patients. For 24 patients with locoregional disease, the 2-year event-free survival rate was 77%; adverse events were two locoregional relapses, one distant relapse, and one secondary leukemia. All six patients with metastatic disease limited to lungs achieved a complete response (CR) and did not relapse; one is in remission 36+ months from diagnosis, but the other patients are not assessable in terms of long-term efficacy of the P6 protocol because of short follow-up time (n = 3), additional systemic therapy (bone marrow transplantation), or septic death (autopsy showed no residual pPNET). All six patients with widespread metastases had major responses, including eradication of extensive bone marrow involvement, but distant relapses ensued. Myelosuppression was severe, but most patients received the first three courses of HD-CAV within 6 to 7 weeks. Major nonhematologic toxicities were mucositis and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Excellent antitumor efficacy and manageable toxicity support the dose-intensive use of HD-CAV for pPNET in children, as well as in young adults. Consolidation of remissions of pPNET metastatic to bone and bone marrow remains a therapeutic challenge.",

BACKGROUND: Data regarding the treatment of nonsexually acquired genital ulceration (NSAGU) are limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of topical and systemic corticosteroids followed by doxycycline prophylaxis for acute and recurrent NSAGU. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with NSAGU treated in a private dermogynecology practice. RESULTS: A total of 26 girls and women with NSAGU were identified and divided into 2 groups: group A = 17 patients with moderate to severe ulceration treated in the acute stage with oral corticosteroid; and group B = 9 patients with mild ulceration treated in the acute stage with topical corticosteroid. Patients in group A, with a mean age of 27.9 years (range, 11-62 years), were treated with oral prednisolone commencing with 15 to 50 mg per day depending on severity. Sixteen (94%) achieved rapid pain relief and complete healing of ulcers within 16 days. Eight (47%) commenced doxycycline prophylaxis. Women in group B, with a mean age of 42.5 years (range, 26-67 years) were treated with topical corticosteroids. Eight (89%) had a history of recurrent ulcers and 6 (66%) commenced doxycycline prophylaxis. Of all 14 patients on doxycycline prophylaxis, none reported any recurrences during a mean follow-up of 18.3 months. There were no adverse effects caused by prednisolone. One patient experienced mild photosensitivity from doxycycline but continued to take it. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective case series from a single private practice-based population.

One of the factors influencing the photosensitivity reactions is the melanin content in melanocytes. In this study, the impact of doxycycline and UVA irradiation on cell viability, melanogenesis and antioxidant defense system in cultured normal human epidermal melanocytes (HEMn-DP) was examined. The exposure of cells to doxycycline and UVA radiation resulted in concentration-dependent loss in melanocytes viability and induced melanin biosynthesis. Significant changes were stated in cellular antioxidant enzymes activity: SOD, CAT and GPx, which indicates alterations of antioxidant defense system.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of bone formation, resulting in low bone mass and an increased propensity to fracture.

Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The pro\u03b11(I) and pro\u03b12(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. However, other, rare phenotypes have also been described. There are many differential diagnoses of the short, syndromic child, including chromosomal, single gene, and multifactorial causes. However, one condition of particular relevance in the context of this report is the Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS). As originally described, the RSS is a very specific condition. However, it has subsequently become an umbrella term for a heterogeneous group of conditions presenting with short stature and triangular shape to the face. A significant proportion of these are now believed to be due to imprinting defects at 11p15. However, the cause in many cases remains unknown. We describe two cases with a phenotypic overlap between OI and RSS who both have COL1A1 mutations. Thus, a type 1 collagenopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of syndromic short stature.",

Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), amplitude and area of compound muscle action potential (CMAP), sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), F- waves and electromyography (EMG) on the deltoid and the first dorsal interosseous muscles on the dominant side were performed, following acute OP poisoning. All neurophysiological assessments except EMG were performed on the controls. Assessments were performed on the day of discharge from the hospital (the first assessment) and six weeks (the second assessment) after the exposure. The controls were assessed only once. RESULTS: There were 70 patients (50 males) and 70 controls. Fifty-three patients attended for the second assessment. In the first assessment MNCV of all the motor nerves examined, CMAP amplitude and SNCV of ulnar nerve, median and ulnar F-wave occurrence in the patients were significantly reduced compared to the controls. In the second assessment significant reduction was found in SNCV of both sensory nerves examined, MNCV of ulnar nerve, CMAP amplitude of common peroneal nerve, F-wave occurrence of median and ulnar nerves. No abnormalities were detected in the patients when compared to the standard cut-off values of nerve conduction studies except F-wave occurrence. EMG studies did not show any abnormality.

PURPOSE: Hot flashes are common experience for menopausal women, and for many, are severe enough to significantly compromise their overall sense of well being and quality of life. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of evening primrose with placebo in improvement of menopausal hot flashes. METHODS: In a 6-week randomized clinical trial, a total of 56 menopausal women aged 45-59 years were participated in this study. The patients were asked for their hot flashes characteristics and responded to HFRDIS (hot flash related daily interference scale) questionnaire before and after the intervention. The participants were randomly assigned to take two capsules per day (totally 90 capsules for 6 weeks) of placebo or evening primrose (500 mg) for continuous 6 weeks. Then, the improvement in hot flashes was compared between two groups. RESULTS: The percent of improvement in hot flash frequency, severity and duration were 39, 42 and 19 %, in evening primrose group compared with 32, 32 and 18 % in placebo group, respectively. Although all three characters of hot flash was ameliorated in evening primrose arm, only its severity was significantly better in this arm compared with placebo group (P < 0.05).

The stage of B-cell development can be identified by the presence of specific cell surface markers. Checkpoints are in place to prevent self-reactive B cells from further development and activation. Some self-reactive B cells are able to escape these checkpoints, resulting in a loss of tolerance. B cells may contribute to systemic autoimmunity and the development of autoimmune disease via cytokine production, antigen presentation, and complement activation. In addition, B cells may trigger autoimmune disease via molecular mimicry, which occurs when a single B-cell receptor recognizes both a non-self antigen molecule and a self-molecule. Accumulating data suggest that ectopic proliferation of B cells in the central nervous system may also play a role.

Keywords used alone or in combination were bladder cancer, diagnosis, surveillance, urinary biomarker, molecular biomarkers, methylation, gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism and microRNA. The cited references of the manuscripts included in the review were also screened. RESULTS: We have reviewed various strategies currently used for gene-based biomarker profiling of bladder cancer. We have comprehensively summarized the performance of several biomarkers in the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer. Finally we have identified biomarkers that have shown potential and now deserve the opportunity to be validated in the clinical setting.

INTRODUCTION: Bone strength determinants such as bone mineral density and bone quality parameters are determined by life-long remodeling of skeletal tissue. Denosumab is a fully human mAb receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand, which selectively inhibits osteoclastogenesis, the end product of a cascade interaction among numerous systemic and local factors and osteoblasts. It has been approved for clinical use by the FDA in the US and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010 (trade name Prolia(\u2122), Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA). AREAS COVERED: This review establishes the concerns and provides insights in issues concerning the cost-effectiveness and safety profile of this new pharmaceutical agent. There is an effort to clarify the special characteristics and the anti-catabolic role of denosumab in the bone tissue homeostasis and more specifically its potential clinical applications and clinical results in the field of postmenopausal osteoporosis. EXPERT OPINION: Administrated as a subcutaneous injection every 6 months, denosumab has been shown to decrease bone turnover and increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone mass or osteoporosis and reduce vertebral, hip and nonvertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The rapid, sustained and reversible effect in suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption, the return of responsiveness on rechallenge, its good tolerability and ease of administration are features that distinguish it from other antiresorptive therapies.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In animal models of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), the free radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant. SAINT I and II were randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials to investigate the efficacy of NXY-059 in patients with AIS. METHODS: Patients with AIS received an infusion of intravenous NXY-059 or placebo within 6 hours from the onset of stroke symptoms. A pooled individual patient analysis was prespecified to assess the overall efficacy and to examine subgroups. The primary end point was the distribution of disability scores measured on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days. Neurologic and activities of daily living scores were investigated as secondary end points. We also evaluated whether treatment with NXY-059 would reduce alteplase-related intracranial hemorrhages. Finally, we evaluated possible predictors of good or poor outcome. RESULTS: An intent-to-treat efficacy analysis was based on 5028 patients. Baseline parameters and prognostic factors were well balanced between treatment groups. The distribution of scores on the mRS was not different in the group treated with NXY-059 (n=2438) compared with the placebo group (n=2456): odds ratio for limiting disability=1.02; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.13 (P=0.682, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Comparisons at each level of the mRS confirmed an absence of benefit. There was no evidence of efficacy in prespecified subgroups or from the secondary outcome analyses. Mortality was equal in the 2 groups (16.7% vs 16.5%), and adverse event rates were similar. Among patients treated with alteplase, there was no decrease in rates of symptomatic or asymptomatic hemorrhage associated with NXY-059 treatment versus placebo. Subgroup analyses identified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, age, markers of inflammation, blood glucose, and right-sided infarct as predictors of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset. This is also true for subgroups and the prevention of alteplase-associated hemorrhage.",

Protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Clinical studies have been divided on the efficacy of protirelin (TRH) despite strong experimental findings that are consistent with a role for the peptide in ALS. Recent findings provide evidence of a gender-related specificity in the ability of protirelin to potentiate the monosynaptic reflex. While castration in male neonatal rats lowered the sensitivity to protirelin, testosterone treatment restored that sensitivity. An examination of the clinical studies reveals a failure either to identify patients' sex or to separate the results on the basis of sex. These findings provide convincing evidence for the potential efficacy of protirelin in ALS if the patient's sex and underlying hormonal status are taken into account.",

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) in the long-term treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: Patients entered this 52-week, open-label extension study after completing an 8-week lead-in study. Safety and tolerability were evaluated at regular intervals on the basis of spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), clinical safety laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG and physical examination. Effectiveness of treatment was assessed using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. RESULTS: A total of 535 patients were treated and 61.3% (n = 328) completed the study, resulting in 393 patient years of exposure to vortioxetine. AEs reported by > 10% of patients were nausea, headache, and nasopharyngitis. Taken together, six patients had eight AEs related to sexual dysfunction. There were no clinically significant safety findings with respect to mean changes of vital signs, weight, ECG parameters, or clinical laboratory values. Patients entered the extension study with a mean MADRS total score of 13.5 \u00b1 8.7. The mean MADRS total score decreased (improved) by approximately 8 points to 5.5 \u00b1 6.0 at Week 52 (OC). By the end of the study, the proportion of responders had increased from 63% to 94% (OC), as had the proportion in remission (MADRS < 10), increasing from 42% to 83% (OC). Patients in remission (n = 226) at the start of this study had a relapse rate (MADRS > 22) of 9.7%. CONCLUSIONS: As with all open-label studies, the conclusions that can be drawn are limited by the lack of a placebo control, making it difficult to assess causality of any changes in outcome measures. However, on the basis of these findings, vortioxetine (2.5, 5, 10 mg/day) demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile and maintained effectiveness over 12 months of treatment.

Class III antiarrhythmic agents have been considered to lengthen the myocardial effective refractory period (ERP) without any significant effects on the conduction velocity. However, recent investigations have clarified the positive or negative dromotropic effects of these agents. Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties. Sotalol shows neither significant positive nor negative dromotropism under the normoxic condition, whereas this agent is reported to exert positive dromotropism mediated by the cAMP-dependent facilitation of gap junctional electrical coupling under the hypoxic condition. Some pure class III agents such as nifekalant are suspected to elicit 'apparent' positive dromotropism in the premature impulse propagation. This is explained by the right and upward shift of the strength-interval curve, which theoretically transforms the graded premature response to the all-or-none response. Although the clinical relevancy of these phenomena remains to be investigated, such variable dromotropism of the individual class III agent may contribute to the better understanding and development of antiarrhythmic agents.",

Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by bone marrow failure, increased cancer risk and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, implying a role for this pathway in the maintenance of genomic stability. The central player of the FA pathway is the multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex activated through a replication- and DNA damage-dependent mechanism. A consequence of the activation of the complex is the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 and FANCI, late term effectors in the maintenance of genome integrity. The details regarding the coordination of the FA-dependent response and the DNA replication process are still mostly unknown. We found, by yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation in human cells, that the core complex subunit FANCF physically interacts with PSF2, a member of the GINS complex essential for both the initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication. In HeLa cells depleted for PSF2, we observed a decreased binding to chromatin of the FA core complex, suggesting that the GINS complex may have a role in either loading or stabilizing the FA core complex onto chromatin. Consistently, GINS and core complex bind chromatin contemporarily upon origin firing and PSF2 depletion sensitizes cells to DNA cross-linking agents. However, depletion of PSF2 is not sufficient to reduce monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 or its localization to nuclear foci following DNA damage. Our results suggest a novel crosstalk between DNA replication and the FA pathway.",

There is a strong association between infection and prematurity; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Nod1 and Nod2 are intracellular pattern recognition receptors that are activated by bacterial peptides and mediate innate immunity. We previously demonstrated that human first-trimester trophoblasts express Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger inflammation upon stimulation. This study sought to determine the expression and function of Nod1 and Nod2 in third-trimester trophoblasts, and to characterize the in vivo effects of Nod1 activation on pregnancy outcome. Human term placental tissues and isolated term trophoblast expressed Nod1, but not Nod2. Activation of Nod1 by its agonist, bacterial \u03b3-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP), in term trophoblast cultures induced a proinflammatory cytokine profile, characterized by elevated levels of secreted IL-6, GRO-\u03b1, and MCP-1, when compared with the control. However, these cytokines were not upregulated in response to Nod2 stimulation with bacterial MDP. Administration of high-dose bacterial iE-DAP to pregnant C57BL/6J mice on embryonic day 14.5 triggered preterm delivery within 24 h. iE-DAP at a lower dose that did not induce prematurity, reduced fetal weight, altered the cytokine profile at the maternal-fetal interface, and induced fetal inflammation. Thus, functional Nod1 is expressed by trophoblast cells across gestation and may have a role in mediating infection-associated inflammation and prematurity. This study demonstrates that pattern recognition receptors, other than the TLRs, may be implicated or involved in infection-associated preterm labor.",

MicroRNAs are short regulatory RNAs that negatively modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers. To investigate whether specific miRNAs and their target genes participate in the molecular pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinoma, oligonucleotide microarrays were used to assess the differential expression profiles of microRNAs and mRNAs in laryngeal carcinoma tissues compared with normal tissues. The oncogenic miRNA, microRNA-21 (miR-21), was found to be upregulated in laryngeal carcinoma tissues. Knockdown of miR-21 by specific antisense oligonucleotides inhibited the proliferation potential of HEp-2 cells, whereas overexpression of miR-21 elevated growth activity of the cells, as detected by the colony formation assay. The cell number reduction caused by miR-21 inhibition was due to the loss of control of the G1-S phase transition, instead of a noticeable increase in apoptosis. Subsequently, a new target gene of miR-21, BTG2, was found to be downregulated in laryngeal carcinoma tissues. BTG2 is known to act as a pan-cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor. These findings indicate that aberrant expression of miR-21 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of laryngeal carcinoma by maintaining a low level of BTG2.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and physiological vaginal changes. METHODS: This multicenter phase 3 study used a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral ospemifene 60 mg/day versus placebo. A total of 605 women aged 40 to 80 years who self-reported a most bothersome symptom of dyspareunia and had a diagnosis of vulvar and vaginal atrophy were randomized to take a once-daily dose of ospemifene (n = 303) or placebo (n = 302) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Analysis of the intent-to-treat (n = 605) population found the efficacy of ospemifene to be significantly greater than that of placebo for each of the following coprimary endpoints: percentages of parabasal and superficial cells, vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia. With ospemifene, the percentage of parabasal cells and vaginal pH significantly decreased; the percentage of superficial cells significantly increased; and dyspareunia was significantly reduced versus placebo (all P < 0.0001, except for dyspareunia: P = 0.0001).

TPPP/p25 (tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25) is an unstructured protein that induces microtubule polymerization in vitro and is aligned along the microtubule network in transfected mammalian cells. In normal human brain, TPPP/p25 is expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes, where its expression is proved to be crucial for their differentiation process. Here we demonstrated that the expression of TPPP/p25 in HeLa cells, in doxycycline-inducible CHO10 cells, and in the oligodendrocyte CG-4 cells promoted the acetylation of alpha-tubulin at residue Lys-40, whereas its down-regulation by specific small interfering RNA in CG-4 cells or by the withdrawal of doxycycline from CHO10 cells decreased the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin. Our results indicate that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. The measurement of HDAC6 activity showed that TPPP/p25 is able to induce almost complete (90%) inhibition at 3 microM concentration. In addition, treatment of the cells with nocodazole, vinblastine, or cold exposure revealed that microtubule acetylation induced by trichostatin A, a well known HDAC6 inhibitor, does not cause microtubule stabilization. In contrast, the microtubule bundling activity of TPPP/p25 was able to protect the microtubules from depolymerization. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. Thus, we suggest that TPPP/p25 is a multiple effector of the microtubule organization.",

BACKGROUND: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), in its severe form, can cause tremendous disability for affected patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results following bilateral radiosurgical anterior capsulotomy for severe medically refractory OCD. METHODS: We performed gamma knife anterior capsulotomy (GKAC) on 3 patients with extreme, medically intractable OCD. According to our protocol, all patients were evaluated by at least 2 psychiatrists who recommended surgery. The patient had to request the procedure, and had to have severe OCD according to the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Patient ages were 37, 55, and 40 years, and pre-radiosurgery YBOCS scores were 34/40, 39/40, and 39/40. Bilateral lesions were created with 2 4-mm isocenters to create an oval volume in the ventral internal capsule at the putaminal midpoint. A maximum dose of 140 or 150 Gy was used. RESULTS: There was no morbidity after the procedure, and all patients returned immediately to baseline function. All patients noted significant functional improvements, and reduction in OCD behavior. Follow-up was at 55, 42, and 28 months. The first patient reduced her YBOCS score from 34 to 24. One patient with compulsive skin picking and an open wound had later healing of the chronic wound and a reduction in the YBOCS score from 39 to 8. At 28 months, the third patient is living and working independently, and her YBOCS score is 18. CONCLUSION: Within a strict protocol, gamma knife radiosurgery provided improvement of OCD behavior with no adverse effects.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, introduced in 1960's as an anti-anginal agent, emerged as a potent anti-arrhythmic agent by 1970's and is currently one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in US for ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent. Because of its minimal negative inotropic activity and very low rate of pro-arrhythmia, it is considered safe in treating arrhythmias in patients with Coronary Artery Disease and Left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Despite these advantages, long term oral therapy with amiodarone is limited by side effect profile involving various organs like thyroid, lung, heart, liver, skin etc. Though the side effects can be decreased significantly by keeping the maintenance dose at 200 to 300 mg/day, patients on amiodarone should be followed closely. Amiodarone interacts with medications such as Warfarin, Digoxin, Macrolides, Floroquinolones etc., which share Cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway. Hence reducing their doses prior to starting amiodarone is recommended. Amiodarone, a category D drug, is contraindicated in pregnant and breast feeding women. This review discusses the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, its evolving clinical indications, management of toxicity and drug interactions.",

Class I alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1s) are the rate-limiting enzymes for ethanol and vitamin A (retinol) metabolism in the liver. Because previous studies have shown that human ADH1 enzymes may participate in bile acid metabolism, we investigated whether the bile acid-activated nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates ADH1 genes. In human hepatocytes, both the endogenous FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid and synthetic FXR-specific agonist GW4064 increased ADH1 mRNA, protein, and activity. Moreover, overexpression of a constitutively active form of FXR induced ADH1A and ADH1B expression, whereas silencing of FXR abolished the effects of FXR agonists on ADH1 expression and activity. Transient transfection studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed functional FXR response elements in the ADH1A and ADH1B proximal promoters, thus indicating that both genes are direct targets of FXR. These findings provide the first evidence for direct connection of bile acid signaling and alcohol metabolism.",

Long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1 or L1s) are abundant retrotransposons that comprise approximately 20% of mammalian genomes. Active L1 retrotransposons can impact the genome in a variety of ways, creating insertions, deletions, new splice sites or gene expression fine-tuning. We have shown previously that L1 retrotransposons are capable of mobilization in neuronal progenitor cells from rodents and humans and evidence of massive L1 insertions was observed in adult brain tissues but not in other somatic tissues. In addition, L1 mobility in the adult hippocampus can be influenced by the environment. The neuronal specificity of somatic L1 retrotransposition in neural progenitors is partially due to the transition of a Sox2/HDAC1 repressor complex to a Wnt-mediated T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activator. The transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin remodelling during neuronal differentiation, allowing a transient stimulation of L1 transcription. The activity of L1 retrotransposons during brain development can have an impact on gene expression and neuronal function, thereby increasing brain-specific genetic mosaicism. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate L1 expression should provide new insights into the role of L1 retrotransposition during brain development. Here we show that L1 neuronal transcription and retrotransposition in rodents are increased in the absence of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein involved in global DNA methylation and human neurodevelopmental diseases. Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders.",

Genetic studies have shown that Aubergine (Aub), one of the Piwi subfamily of Argonautes in Drosophila, is essential for germ cell formation and maintaining fertility. aub mutations lead to the accumulation of retrotransposons in ovaries and testes, and Stellate transcripts in testes. Aub in ovaries associates with a variety of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) derived from repetitive intergenic elements including retrotransposons. Here we found that Aub in testes also associates with various kinds of piRNAs. Although in ovaries Aub-associated piRNA populations are quite diverse, piRNAs with Aub in testes show a strong bias. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing. The second most abundant class was made up of those from chromosome X and showed strong complementarity to vasa transcripts.

Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the sleep-related movement disorders, including restless legs syndrome (RLS; Willis-Ekbom disease), periodic limb movement disorder, rhythmic movement disorders, sleep-related bruxism, and sleep-related leg cramps. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of clinically significant RLS is 1.5% to 3.0%. The pathophysiology of RLS may involve abnormal iron transport across the blood-brain barrier and down-regulation of putaminal D2 receptors. The availability of the rotigotine patch provides an additional form of dopaminergic therapy for RLS. Calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin) provide alternative therapies for RLS especially in patients with augmentation, impulse control disorders, or hypersomnia induced by dopamine agonists. Long-term use of opioid medication is safe and effective for refractory cases of RLS. SUMMARY: RLS is a common disorder causing considerable morbidity. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate investigations are essential. Many effective therapies are available, but the side effects of each class of medication should be considered in determining optimal treatment. Periodic limb movements of sleep, bruxism, and rhythmic movement disorders are sleep-related phenomena often accompanying other sleep disorders and only sometimes requiring primary therapy. Sleep-related leg cramps are generally idiopathic. Management is challenging with few effective therapies.",

We have previously shown that non-myocytes present in healed 8-week infarct scar overexpress transduction proteins required for initiating the elevated deposition of structural matrix proteins in this tissue. Other work suggests that TGF-beta 1 may be involved in cardiac fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy. However, the significance of the altered TGF-beta signaling in heart failure in the chronic phase of post-myocardial infarction (MI), particularly in the ongoing remodeling of the infarct scar, remains unexplored. Patterns of cardiac TGF beta 1 and Smad 2, 3, and 4 protein expression were investigated 8 weeks after MI and were compared to relative collagen deposition in border tissues (containing remnent myocytes) and the infarct scar (non-myocytes). Both TGF-beta 1 mRNA abundance and protein levels were significantly increased in the infarct scar v control values, and this trend was positively correlated to increased collagen type I expression. Cardiac Smad 2, 3, and 4 proteins were significantly increased in border and scar tissues v control values. Immunofluorescent studies indicated that Smad proteins localized proximal to the cellular nuclei present in the infarct scar. Decorin mRNA abundance was elevated in border and infarct scar, and the pattern of decorin immunostaining was markedly altered in remote remnant heart and scar v staining patterns of control sections. Expression of T beta RI (53 kDa) protein was significantly reduced in the scar, while the 75 kDa and 110 kDa isoforms of T beta RII were unchanged and significantly increased in scar, respectively. These results indicate that TGF-beta/Smad signaling may be involved in the remodeling of the infarct scar after the completion of wound healing per se, via ongoing stimulation of matrix deposition.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of skin biopsies as a biomarker of disease severity in subjects with amyloid neuropathy. METHODS: Five groups of patients were studied: (1) transthyretin (TTR) familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP; n = 20), (2) TTR mutation carriers without peripheral neuropathy (TTR-noPN; n = 10), (3) healthy controls (n = 20), (4) diabetic neuropathy disease controls (n = 20), and (5) patients with light-chain (AL) amyloid (n = 2). All subjects underwent neurological examination and 3mm skin biopsies. Sections were stained with anti-PGP9.5, anti-TTR, and Congo red. Intraepidermal (IENFD), sweat gland (SGNFD), and pilomotor nerve fiber densities (PMNFD) were measured. Correlations between the amount of amyloid present (amyloid burden), fiber subtype, and Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) were evaluated. RESULTS: IENFD, SGNFD, and PMNFD were all significantly reduced in TTR-FAP patients versus healthy controls, whereas TTR-noPN subjects had intermediate reductions. Lower nerve fiber densities were associated with NIS-LL (p < 0.001). Congo red staining revealed brilliant red amyloid deposits confirmed by apple-green birefringence within dermal collagen, sweat glands, and arrector pili that engulfed axons. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to detect amyloid in skin were 70% and 100%. Both AL amyloidosis and 2 of 10 TTR-noPN subjects were Congo red-positive. Amyloid burden correlated with IENFD (r = -0.63), SGNFD (r = -0.67), PMNFD (r = -0.50), and NIS-LL (r = -0.57). Wild-type TTR staining was less prominent in TTR-FAP patients. INTERPRETATION: Cutaneous amyloid was detected in 70% of TTR-FAP and 20% of TTR-noPN subjects. Amyloid burden correlated strongly with reductions in IENFD, SGNFD, PMNFD, and NIS-LL. Skin is an attractive tissue to establish an amyloid diagnosis, and amyloid burden has potential as a biomarker to detect treatment effect in TTR-FAP drug trials. Ann Neurol 2017;82:44-56.",

BACKGROUND: Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) often have low serum triiodothyronine (T(3)) concentrations. In a rodent model of myocardial infarction-induced CHF and low serum T(3), we hypothesized that replacing T(3) to euthyroid levels would improve left ventricular function without producing untoward signs of thyrotoxicosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (myocardial infarction). One week post-myocardial infarction, left ventricular fractional shortening was significantly reduced to 22+/-1% in CHF animals versus 38+/-1% for sham-operated controls (P<0.001). Serum T(3) concentration was also significantly reduced (80+/-3 versus 103+/-6 ng/dL; P<0.001), in CHF animals versus Shams. At 9 weeks post-myocardial infarction, systolic function (+dP/dt max) was significantly attenuated in CHF animals (4773+/-259 versus 6310+/-267 mmHg/s; P<0.001) as well as diastolic function measured by half time to relaxation (15.9+/-1.2 versus 11.1+/-0.3 ms; P<0.001). alpha-myosin heavy chain expression was also significantly reduced by 77% (P<0.001), and beta-myosin heavy chain expression was increased by 21%. Continuous T(3) replacement was initiated 1 week post-myocardial infarction with osmotic mini-pumps (6 microg/kg/d), which returned serum T(3) concentrations to levels similar to Sham controls while resting conscious heart rate, arterial blood pressure and the incidence of arrhythmias were not different. At 9 weeks, systolic function was significantly improved by T(3) replacement (6279+/-347 mmHg/s; P<0.05) and a trend toward improved diastolic function (12.3+/-0.6 ms) was noted. T(3) replacement in CHF animals also significantly increased alpha- and reduced beta-MHC expression, (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that T(3) replacement to euthyroid levels improves systolic function and tends to improve diastolic function, potentially through changes in myocardial gene expression.",

In bacteria and eukaryotes, replication initiates from single and multiple origins, respectively, while archaea can adopt either of the two modes. The Z-curve method has been successfully used to identify replication origins in genomes of various species, including multiple oriCs in some archaea.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress, characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death in affected patients. In this study we used a mathematical model to simulate two mutations linked toCPVT, in cardiac calsequestrin (CSQN2) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The aim of the present study is to characterize the mutations responsible for CPVT and establish the mechanistic basis for spontaneous Ca2+ release events that lead to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered arrhythmias. Simulated calcium transients in the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated the smaller amplitude and time to peak, as well as accelerated recovery from inactivation seen in experiments. When simulated CSQN2-mutant myocytes were paced in current-clamp mode, DADs were observed, suggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal Ca2(+) sensing can lead to the triggered activity observed in the mutant CSQN2. Simulations of mutant RyR2 suggest that the hyperactive, \"leaky\" receptors characteristic of reduced FKBP12.6 function may be centrally involved in triggering DADs. These results provide plausible mechanisms by which defects in RyR2 gating may lead to the cellular triggers of CPVT, with implications for the development of targeted therapies.",

Nuclear organization has emerged as a key parameter in the formation of chromosomal translocations, yet little is known as to whether DNA repair can efficiently occur throughout the nucleus and whether it is affected by the location of the lesion. Here, we induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at different nuclear compartments and follow their fate. We demonstrate that DSBs induced at the nuclear membrane (but not at nuclear pores or nuclear interior) fail to rapidly activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair by homologous recombination (HR). Real-time and superresolution imaging reveal that DNA DSBs within lamina-associated domains do not migrate to more permissive environments for HR, like the nuclear pores or the nuclear interior, but instead are repaired in situ by alternative end-joining. Our results are consistent with a model in which nuclear position dictates the choice of DNA repair pathway, thus revealing a new level of regulation in DSB repair controlled by spatial organization of DNA within the nucleus.",

Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. HRC might play a particularly relevant role in the equine heart, given its slower resting heart rate (20-35 beats/min) and longer action potential duration (APD) (0.6-1.0 s) than are found in other mammals. The results from this study showed for the first time direct evidence that HRC protein in equine cardiac muscle was expressed in association with the SR membranes and that HRC transcriptional activity was three times higher in the ventricles compared to the atria. The predominance of HRC mRNA up-regulation in ventricular myocardium was specific to the horse heart, since a more even distribution between atria and ventricles was found in animals of similar body size or species, such as cattle or domestic donkeys.",

In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), chronic exposure to nonphysiologic PD fluids elicits low-grade peritoneal inflammation, leading to fibrosis and angiogenesis. Phenotype conversion of mesothelial cells into myofibroblasts, the so-called mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT), significantly contributes to the peritoneal dysfunction related to PD. A number of factors have been described to induce MMT in vitro and in vivo, of which TGF-\u03b21 is probably the most important. The vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a transcriptional target of TGF-\u03b21 and mediates excessive scarring and fibrosis in several tissues. This work studied the contribution of ET-1 to the development of peritoneal damage and failure in a mouse model of PD. ET-1 and its receptors were expressed in the peritoneal membrane and upregulated on PD fluid exposure. Administration of an ET receptor antagonist, either bosentan or macitentan, markedly attenuated PD-induced MMT, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and peritoneal functional decline. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ET-1 induced MMT in human mesothelial cells in vitro and promoted the early cellular events associated with peritoneal dysfunction in vivo. Notably, TGF-\u03b21-blocking peptides prevented these actions of ET-1. Furthermore, a positive reciprocal relationship was observed between ET-1 expression and TGF-\u03b21 expression in human mesothelial cells. These results strongly support a role for an ET-1/TGF-\u03b21 axis as an inducer of MMT and subsequent peritoneal damage and fibrosis, and they highlight ET-1 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of PD-associated dysfunction.",

A central problem in population genetics is to detect and analyze positive natural selection by which beneficial mutations are driven to fixation. The hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population, which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. This raises a possibility of detecting a \"hidden\" geographic structure of population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.",

BACKGROUND: The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas. Relocation, acquisition of the IHC and FISH images, and enumeration of FISH signals in the immunophenotyped tumour areas were done in an automated fashion. RESULTS: Automated FISH analysis was performed on 13 different colon cancer samples that had been stained for CD133; each sample was scored for MYC, ZNF217 and Chromosome 6 in CD133 positive and negative glands. From the 13 cases four (31%) showed amplification for the MYC oncogene and seven of 13 (54%) cases were amplified for ZNF217. There was no significant difference between CD133 positive tumour and CD133 negative tumour cells. CONCLUSION: The technique and algorithm presented here enables an easy and reproducible combination of IHC and FISH based on a novel automated algorithm using relocation and automated spot counting.",

Analysis of over 60 million 3P-seq reads substantially increased and improved existing 3' UTR annotations, resulting in confidently identified 3' UTRs for >79% of the annotated protein-coding genes in zebrafish. mRNAs from most zebrafish genes undergo alternative CPA, with those from more than a thousand genes using different dominant 3' UTRs at different stages. These included one of the poly(A) polymerase genes, for which alternative CPA reinforces its repression in the ovary. 3' UTRs tend to be shortest in the ovaries and longest in the brain. Isoforms with some of the shortest 3' UTRs are highly expressed in the ovary, yet absent in the maternally contributed RNAs of the embryo, perhaps because their 3' UTRs are too short to accommodate a uridine-rich motif required for stability of the maternal mRNA. At 2 h post-fertilization, thousands of unique poly(A) sites appear at locations lacking a typical polyadenylation signal, which suggests a wave of widespread cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA degradation intermediates.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial regulator of energy metabolic homeostasis and thus a major survival factor in a variety of metabolic stresses and also in the aging process. Metabolic syndrome is associated with a low-grade, chronic inflammation, primarily in adipose tissue. A low-level of inflammation is also present in the aging process. There are emerging results indicating that AMPK signaling can inhibit the inflammatory responses induced by the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) system. The NF-\u03baB subunits are not direct phosphorylation targets of AMPK, but the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling is mediated by several downstream targets of AMPK, e.g., SIRT1, PGC-1\u03b1, p53, and Forkhead box O (FoxO) factors. AMPK signaling seems to enhance energy metabolism while it can repress inflammatory responses linked to chronic stress, e.g., in nutritional overload and during the aging process. AMPK can inhibit endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stresses which are involved in metabolic disorders and the aging process. Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses. The activation capacity of AMPK declines in metabolic stress and with aging which could augment the metabolic diseases and accelerate the aging process. We will review the AMPK pathways involved in the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling and suppression of inflammation. We also emphasize that the capacity of AMPK to repress inflammatory responses can have a significant impact on both healthspan and lifespan.",

This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of multiple doses of paroxetine controlled release (CR) in PMDD. METHODS: In a multicenter (43 outpatient U.S. sites), placebo-controlled trial, 327 females aged 18 to 45 years, with regular menstrual cycles, meeting DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, were randomly assigned to receive paroxetine CR 12.5 mg; paroxetine CR 25 mg; or placebo, once daily, for up to three treatment cycles. The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline to end point in mean luteal phase Visual Analogue Scale-Mood (irritability, tension, affective lability, depressed mood) score. RESULTS: At end point, subjects treated with paroxetine CR (12.5 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated significant improvement in VAS-Mood scores compared with those who received placebo (paroxetine CR 12.5 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -8.7 mm; 95% CI, -15.7, -1.7; p =.015; paroxetine CR 25 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -12.1 mm; 95% CI, -18.9, -5.3; p <.001). Results were also significant across measures of physical symptoms and social functioning. Paroxetine CR was well tolerated; 9.5% of subjects treated with 12.5 mg and 13.5% of subjects treated with 25 mg withdrew from the trial due to adverse events, compared with 6.5% of subjects in the placebo group.

Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. To test this hypothesis theoretically, ten Stauranthus quinoline alkaloids were examined for potential intercalation into DNA using a molecular docking approach. Four of the alkaloids (stauranthine, skimmianine, 3',6'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dihydrostauranthine, and trans-3',4'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dihydrostauranthine) were able to intercalatively dock consistently into DNA. In order to probe the intermolecular interactions that may be responsible for intercalation of these quinoline alkaloids, density functional calculations have been carried out using both the B3LYP and M06 functionals. M06 calculations indicated favorable pi-pi interactions between either skimmianine or stauranthine and the guanine-cytosine base pair. Furthermore, the lowest-energy face-to-face orientation of stauranthine with guanine is consistent with favorable dipole-dipole orientations, favorable electrostatic interactions, and favorable frontier molecular orbital interactions. Likewise, the lowest-energy face-to-face orientation of stauranthine with the guanine-cytosine base pair reveals favorable electrostatic interactions as well as frontier molecular orbital interactions. Thus, not only can quinoline alkaloids dock intercalatively into DNA, but the docked orientations are also electronically favorable.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and tolerability of four doses of immediate-release molindone hydrochloride in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and serious conduct problems. METHODS: This open-label, parallel-group, dose-ranging, multicenter trial randomized children, aged 6-12 years, with ADHD and persistent, serious conduct problems to receive oral molindone thrice daily for 9-12 weeks in four treatment groups: Group 1-10 mg (5 mg if weight <30 kg), group 2-20 mg (10 mg if <30 kg), group 3-30 mg (15 mg if <30 kg), and group 4-40 mg (20 mg if <30 kg). The primary outcome measure was to evaluate safety and tolerability of molindone in children with ADHD and serious conduct problems. Secondary outcome measures included change in Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical Intelligence Quotient (NCBRF-TIQ) Conduct Problem subscale scores, change in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) subscale scores from baseline to end point, and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham rating scale-revised (SNAP-IV) ADHD-related subscale scores. RESULTS: The study randomized 78 children; 55 completed the study. Treatment with molindone was generally well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory or physical examination findings. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included somnolence (n=9), weight increase (n=8), akathisia (n=4), sedation (n=4), and abdominal pain (n=4). Mean weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2). The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs increased with increasing dose. NCBRF-TIQ subscale scores improved in all four treatment groups, with 34%, 34%, 32%, and 55% decreases from baseline in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. CGI-S and SNAP-IV scores improved over time in all treatment groups, and CGI-I scores improved to the greatest degree in group 4. CONCLUSIONS: Molindone at doses of 5-20 mg/day (children weighing <30 kg) and 20-40 mg ( > 30 kg) was well tolerated, and preliminary efficacy results suggest that molindone produces dose-related behavioral improvements over 9-12 weeks.

CD52 is a 21- to 28-kd nonmodulating cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed (up to 5 x 10(5) molecules per cell) on most normal and malignant lymphocytes and monocytes. Its functions are unknown. CD52 is an excellent target for complement-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. A series of rat and genetically reshaped human CD52 antibodies has been assessed for the ability to deplete lymphocytes in vivo to induce immunosuppression and for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. CD52 antibodies that activate both complement and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity consistently deplete lymphocytes from blood, spleen, and bone marrow but are less effective against lymph node disease or extranodal masses. CD52 antibodies provide effective therapy for chronic leukemias, such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and some subtypes of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, that may be resistant to conventional chemotherapy. For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. In contrast, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CD52 antibodies may be more effective in the setting of minimal residual disease and may allow harvesting of uncontaminated stem cells. Further experiments to enhance the activity of CD52 antibodies in sites refractory to antibody alone are currently being undertaken.",

OBJECTIVE: This study carried out the first patient-oriented survey on the practice of analgesia and sedation in German intensive care units, examining whether the goals of early spontaneous breathing and awake, cooperative patients are achieved. DESIGN: A postal survey was sent to 261 hospitals in Germany. Each hospital received three patient-oriented forms with questions regarding current agents and techniques for analgesia and sedation of a specific patient. Responses were obtained from 220 (84%) hospitals which returned 305 questionnaires. RESULTS: Patients' Ramsay sedation scale was significantly higher in all phases of analgesia and sedation, indicating that the patients were more deeply sedated than currently intended by the therapist. Propofol was used for most of the patients during short-term sedation (57%) and during weaning (48%). The preferred agent for sedation longer than 72[Symbol: see text]h was midazolam (66%). CONCLUSION: The choice of agents and techniques for analgesia and sedation in the intensive care unit thus follows the German guidelines. The fact that the patients were more deeply sedated than intended by the therapist in all phases of sedation may be due to the low use of sedation scales and clinical practice guidelines or to the lack of training in using these techniques.",

Samples were genotyped for PTPN22 1858C/T variants using a TaqMan 5'-allele discrimination assay. RESULTS: The presence of shared epitope (SE) alleles was strongly associated with anti-CCP and RF-positive RA [P = 7.05 x 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) 4.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.76-7.57 and P = 1.68 x 10(-6), OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.89-4.74, respectively).

RATIONALE: In cardiac dyads, junctional Ca2+ directly controls the gating of the ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and is itself dominated by RyR-mediated Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Existing probes do not report such local Ca2+ signals because of probe diffusion, so a junction-targeted Ca2+ sensor should reveal new information on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and its modification in disease states. OBJECTIVE: To investigate Ca2+ signaling in the nanoscopic space of cardiac dyads by targeting a new sensitive Ca2+ biosensor (GCaMP6f) to the junctional space. METHODS AND RESULTS: By fusing GCaMP6f to the N terminus of triadin 1 or junctin, GCaMP6f-triadin 1/junctin was targeted to dyadic junctions, where it colocalized with t-tubules and RyRs after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. This membrane protein-tagged biosensor displayed = 4\u00d7 faster kinetics than native GCaMP6f. Confocal imaging revealed junctional Ca2+ transients (Ca2+ nanosparks) that were = 50\u00d7 smaller in volume than conventional Ca2+ sparks (measured with diffusible indicators). The presence of the biosensor did not disrupt normal Ca2+ signaling. Because no indicator diffusion occurred, the amplitude and timing of release measurements were improved, despite the small recording volume. We could also visualize coactivation of subclusters of RyRs within a single junctional region, as well as quarky Ca2+ release events. CONCLUSIONS: This new, targeted biosensor allows selective visualization and measurement of nanodomain Ca2+ dynamics in intact cells and can be used to give mechanistic insights into dyad RyR operation in health and in disease states such as when RyRs become orphaned.",

Calcium signaling, intrinsic to skeletal and cardiac muscle function, is critically dependent on the amount of calcium stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the ryanodine receptor and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. We examined the influence of phosphorylation of calsequestrin on its ability to store calcium, to polymerise and to regulate ryanodine receptors by binding to triadin and junctin. Our hypothesis was that these parameters might be altered by phosphorylation of threonine 353, which is located near the calcium and triadin/junctin binding sites. Although phosphorylation increased the calcium binding capacity of calsequestrin nearly 2-fold, it did not alter calsequestrin polymerisation, its binding to triadin or junctin or inhibition of ryanodine receptor activity at 1 mM luminal calcium. Phosphorylation was required for calsequestrin binding to junctin when calcium concentration was low (100 nM), and ryanodine receptors were activated by dephosphorylated calsequestrin when it bound to triadin alone. These novel data shows that phosphorylated calsequestrin is required for high capacity calcium buffering and suggest that ryanodine receptor inhibition by calsequestrin is mediated by junctin.",

Furthermore, curcumin treatment significantly decreased the percentage of CD4(+) T helper cells in EAN spleen and suppressed concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. In addition, curcumin altered helper T cell differentiation by decreasing IFN-\u03b3(+) CD4(+) Th1 cells in EAN lymph node and spleen.

It has been investigated in healthy volunteers, and in individuals with clinical disorders associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, impaired cognition and other symptoms. This review examines the use of modafinil in clinical practice based on the results of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials available in the English language in the MEDLINE database. In sleep-deprived individuals, modafinil improves mood, fatigue, sleepiness and cognition to a similar extent as caffeine but has a longer duration of action. Evidence for improved cognition in non-sleep-deprived healthy volunteers is controversial.Modafinil improves excessive sleepiness and illness severity in all three disorders for which it has been approved by the US FDA, i.e. narcolepsy, shift-work sleep disorder and obstructive sleep apnoea with residual excessive sleepiness despite optimal use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, its effects on safety on the job and on morbidities associated with these disorders have not been ascertained. Continued use of CPAP in obstructive sleep apnoea is essential. Modafinil does not benefit cataplexy.In very small, short-term trials, modafinil improved excessive sleepiness in patients with myotonic dystrophy. It was efficacious in fairly large studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents, and was as efficacious as methylphenidate in a small trial, but has not been approved by the FDA, in part because of its serious dermatological toxicity. In a trial of 21 non-concurrent subjects, with 2-week treatment periods, modafinil was as effective as dexamfetamine in adult ADHD. Modafinil was helpful for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder in a trial that excluded patients with stimulant-induced mania. A single dose of modafinil may hasten recovery from general anaesthesia after day surgery. A single dose of modafinil improved the ability of emergency room physicians to attend didactic lectures after a night shift, but did not improve their ability to drive home and caused sleep disturbances subsequently.Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo.Trials of modafinil for excessive sleepiness in Parkinson's disease, cocaine addiction and cognition in chronic fatigue syndrome provided inconsistent results; all studies had extremely small sample sizes. Modafinil cannot be recommended for these conditions until definitive data become available.Modafinil induces and inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and has the potential for interacting with drugs from all classes. The modafinil dose should be reduced in the elderly and in patients with hepatic disease. Caution is needed in patients with severe renal insufficiency because of substantial increases in levels of modafinil acid. Common adverse events with modafinil include insomnia, headache, nausea, nervousness and hypertension. Decreased appetite, weight loss and serious dermatological have been reported with greater frequency in children and adolescents, probably due to the higher doses (based on bodyweight) used. Modafinil may have some abuse/addictive potential although no cases have been reported to date.",

Certain autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have consistently been associated with an increased risk of malignant lymphomas, but it is unclear whether elevated lymphoma risk is a phenomenon that accompanies inflammatory conditions in general. Likewise, it is debated whether the increased risk identified in association with some disorders pertains equally to all individuals or whether it varies among groups of patients with different phenotypic or treatment-related characteristics. It is similarly unclear to what extent the increased lymphoma occurrence is mediated through specific lymphoma subtypes. This update reviews the many findings on risks, risk levels, and lymphoma characteristics that have been presented recently in relation to a broad range of chronic inflammatory, including autoimmune, conditions. Recent results clearly indicate an association between severity of chronic inflammation and lymphoma risk in RA and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Thus, the average risk of lymphoma in RA may be composed of a markedly increased risk in those with most severe disease and little or no increase in those with mild or moderate disease. The roles of immunosuppressive therapy and EBV infection seem to be limited. Furthermore, RA, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly celiac disease may share an association with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in addition to well-established links of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome with risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and of celiac disease with risk of small intestinal lymphoma.

Aplastic anemia is a fatal bone marrow disorder characterized by peripheral pancytopenia and marrow hypoplasia. The disease can be hereditary or acquired and develops at any stage of life. A subgroup of the inherited form is caused by replicative impairment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to very short telomeres as a result of mutations in telomerase and other telomere components. Abnormal telomere shortening is also described in cases of acquired aplastic anemia, most likely secondary to increased turnover of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells. Here, we test the therapeutic efficacy of telomerase activation by using adeno-associated virus (AAV)9 gene therapy vectors carrying the telomerase Tert gene in 2 independent mouse models of aplastic anemia due to short telomeres (Trf1- and Tert-deficient mice). We find that a high dose of AAV9-Tert targets the bone marrow compartment, including hematopoietic stem cells. AAV9-Tert treatment after telomere attrition in bone marrow cells rescues aplastic anemia and mouse survival compared with mice treated with the empty vector. Improved survival is associated with a significant increase in telomere length in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, as well as improved blood counts.

BACKGROUND: Beta-trace protein (BTP) and cystatin C (CysC) are novel biomarkers of renal function. We assessed the ability of both to predict major bleeding (MB) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), compared to other renal function parameters and clinical risk scores. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 273 patients. Blood samples were obtained within 24h of admission. The endpoint was MB. During a follow-up of 760 days (411-1,098 days), 25 patients (9.2%) had MB. Patients with MB had higher concentrations of BTP (0.98 mg/L; 0.71-1.16 mg/L vs. 0.72 mg/L, 0.60-0.91 mg/L, P=0.002), CysC (1.05 mg/L; 0.91-1.30 mg/L vs. 0.90 mg/L, 0.75-1.08 mg/L, P=0.003), higher CRUSADE score (39 \u00b1 16 points vs. 29 \u00b1 15 points, P=0.002) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 66 \u00b1 27 vs. 80 \u00b1 30 ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b71.73 m(-2), P=0.02) than patients without MB; there was no difference in creatinine level between the groups (P=0.14). After multivariable adjustment, both were predictors of MB, while eGFR and creatinine did not achieve statistical significance. Among subjects with eGFR >60 ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b71.73 m(-2), those with elevated concentrations of both biomarkers had a significantly higher risk for MB. Net reclassification indexes from the addition of BTP and CysC to CRUSADE risk score were 38% and 21% respectively, while the relative integrated discrimination indexes were 12.5% and 3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Among NSTE-ACS patients, BTP and CysC were superior to conventional renal parameters for predicting MB, and improved clinical stratification for hemorrhagic risk.",

The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow, fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been found to be an effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia patients and is being tested for treating other hematologic malignancies. We have previously shown that AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME), a fusion gene generated by a t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia during blast phase, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), impairs hematopoiesis and eventually induces an AML in mice. Both fusion partners of AME, AML1 and MDS1/EVI1, encode transcription factors and are also targets of a variety of genetic abnormalities in human hematologic malignancies. In addition, aberrant expression of ectopic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) has also been found in solid tumors, such as ovarian and colon cancers. In this study, we examined whether ATO could target AME and related oncoproteins. We found that ATO used at therapeutic levels degrades AME. The ATO treatment induces differentiation and apoptosis in AME leukemic cells in vitro as well as reduces tumor load and increases the survival of mice transplanted with these cells. We further found that ATO targets AME via both myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) and EVI1 moieties and degrades EVI1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 in a proteasome-independent manner. Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers.",

Arginine residues in RG-rich proteins are frequently dimethylated posttranslationally by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). The most common methylation pattern is asymmetrical dimethylation, a modification important for protein shuttling and signal transduction. Symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMA) have until now been confined to the myelin basic protein MBP and the Sm proteins D1 and D3. We show here by mass spectrometry and protein sequencing that also the human Sm protein B/B' and, for the first time, one of the Sm-like proteins, LSm4, contain sDMA in vivo. The symmetrical dimethylation of B/B', LSm4, D1, and D3 decisively influences their binding to the Tudor domain of the \"survival of motor neurons\" protein (SMN): inhibition of dimethylation by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) abolished the binding of D1, D3, B/B', and LSm4 to this domain. A synthetic peptide containing nine sDMA-glycine dipeptides, but not asymmetrically modified or nonmodified peptides, specifically inhibited the interaction of D1, D3, B/B', LSm4, and UsnRNPs with SMN-Tudor. Recombinant D1 and a synthetic peptide could be methylated in vitro by both HeLa cytosolic S100 extract and nuclear extract; however, only the cytosolic extract produced symmetrical dimethylarginines. Thus, the Sm-modifying PRMT is cytoplasmic, and symmetrical dimethylation of B/B', D1, and D3 is a prerequisite for the SMN-dependent cytoplasmic core-UsnRNP assembly. Our demonstration of sDMAs in LSm4 suggests additional functions of sDMAs in tri-UsnRNP biogenesis and mRNA decay. Our findings also have interesting implications for the understanding of the aetiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).",

Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.",

The combined exposure of the nanoformulations in colon cancer cells (HT 29) proved the enhanced anticancer effects. In addition, the in vivo pharmacokinetic data in mouse model revealed the improved plasma concentrations of 5-FU and CUR which prolonged up to 72 h unlike the bare drugs.

There is considerable experimental evidence that hyperactive Ras proteins promote breast cancer growth and development including invasiveness, despite the low frequency of mutated forms of Ras in breast cancer. We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in aberrant growth and metastasis formation of many tumor types including breast cancer. The present study aims to investigate the correlation between EGF-induced invasiveness and Ras activation in four widely used breast cancer cell lines. Upon EGF stimulation, invasive abilities and H-Ras activation were significantly increased in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, but not in MDA-MB-453 and T47D cell lines. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target H-Ras, we showed a crucial role of H-Ras in the invasive phenotype induced by EGF in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. Taken together, this study characterized human breast cancer cell lines with regard to the relationship between H-Ras activation and the invasive phenotype induced by EGF. Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells.",

PURPOSE: Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma. Previously, we analyzed a large series of paired primary and metastatic melanomas for NRAS codon 61 mutations and showed that they arise early and are preserved during tumor progression. Here, we have screened the same tumor samples for BRAF mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary melanomas (n = 71) and corresponding metastases (n = 88) from 71 patients were screened for BRAF exon 11 and exon 15 mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis RESULTS: BRAF mutations were found in 42 of 71 patients (59%). Thirty-seven patients had mutations that lead to a Val599Glu change, whereas mutations resulting in Gly468Ser, Val599Arg, Val599Lys, and Lys600Glu changes were detected in one patient each. Furthermore, one patient had a 6-bp insertion between codons 598 and 599, encoding two threonine residues. In most cases, paired primary and metastatic lesions had the same BRAF genotype (i.e., mutations present in the primary tumors were preserved in the corresponding metastases, and mutations did not arise at the metastatic stage if they were not present in the primary lesion). Using laser-capture microdissection, BRAF mutations were found in the radial growth phase of the primary lesions. BRAF mutations occurred exclusively in tumors that were wild type for NRAS, and in total, 89% of the patients analyzed (63 of 71) had mutations in either of these two genes. CONCLUSIONS: The Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway is activated in the vast majority of melanomas. Activation occurs through either NRAS or BRAF mutations, both of which arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression.",

CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. The majority of circRNAs are conserved across species, are stable and resistant to RNase R, and often exhibit tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases.

Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart. In this paper, we make a detailed comparison between the calcium homeostasis/signaling networks in yeast cells and those in mammalian cardiac myocytes. This comparison covers not only the components, structure and function of the networks but also includes existing knowledge on the measured and simulated network dynamics using mathematical models. Surprisingly, most of the factors known in the yeast calcium homeostasis/signaling network are conserved and operate similarly in mammalian cells, including cardiac myocytes. Moreover, the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is a simple organism that affords powerful genetic and genomic tools. Thus, exploring and understanding the calcium homeostasis/signaling system in yeast can provide a shortcut to help understand calcium homeostasis/signaling systems in mammalian cardiac myocytes. In turn, this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.",

An efficient shotgun lipidomics strategy was established and optimized for fast phospholipid profiling of viscera from three fish species: Lateolabrax japonicas, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, and Carassius auratus. This strategy relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a tandem mass spectrometer without additional separation of the individual molecular species. Four classes of phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS), were analyzed, and at least 81 molecular species of phospholipids were identified, including 34 species of PC, 24 species of PE, 12 species of PS, and 11 species of PI, in both positive- and negative-ion electrospray ionization mode. The results show that fish viscera, which are traditionally discarded as fisheries wastes, are nutritional in phospholipids with total contents of the four detected phospholipid classes ranging from 1.52 to 3.29 mg/g in the three tested fish species. Regardless of the tested fish species, PC and PE are the dominant phospholipid classes, followed by PI and PS. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to normalize the relative amounts of the identified phospholipid species. The results demonstrate that PS 18:0/22:6, PI 18:0/20:4, and PI 18:0/20:5 were the main contributors of cumulative value and could be used as an indicator for fish species differentiation. This shotgun lipidomics method was >10 times faster than traditional methods, because no chromatographic separation was needed. The successful application of this strategy paves the way for full utilization of traditionally discarded fisheries wastes and provides an alternative means for fish species differentiation.",

The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mouse foetal muscle, mouse adult muscle and a rat neuronal), using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for alpha, beta, gamma, delta subunits (the native foetal muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha, beta, epsilon, delta subunits (the native adult muscle subunit combination), or with cRNAs for alpha4beta2 subunits (a putative native neuronal subunit combination). Acetylcholine had a similar potency at all three subunit combinations (EC50 11.6, 17.4 and 19.1 microM, respectively). At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of the acetylcholine currents for the foetal and adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine was independent of the holding voltage over the range -100 to -40 mV. In oocytes expressing the foetal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors the inhibition of the current in response to 100 microM acetylcholine by 10 nM d-tubocurarine was 29 +/- 5% (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 7), and the inhibition by 10 nM pancuronium was 39 +/- 6% (mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 8; P > 0.05 vs. d-tubocurarine). However, in the adult form of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, 10 nM d-tubocurarine and 10 nM pancuronium were both more effective at blocking the response to 100 microM acetylcholine compared to the foetal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, with values of 55 +/- 5% (P < 0.01; n = 12) and 60 +/- 4% (P < 0.001; n = 10), respectively. Thus the developmental switch from the gamma to the epsilon subunit alters the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor for both pancuronium and d-tubocurarine. Vecuronium was more potent than pancuronium. One nM vecuronium reduced the response to 100 microM acetylcholine by 71 +- 6% (n = 10) for foetal and 63 +/- 5% (n = 4) for adult nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor combination, 10 nM pancuronium was a more effective antagonist of the response to 100 microM acetylcholine (69 +/- 6%, n = 6) than 10 nM d-tubocurarine (30 +/- 5%; n = 6; P < 0.05 compared to pancuronium). This is in contrast to the adult muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, where pancuronium and d-tubocurarine were equieffective. The expression of the beta2 subunit with muscle alpha, epsilon and delta subunits formed a functional receptor which was blocked by pancuronium and d-tubocurarine in a similar manner to the alphabeta1epsilondelta subunit consistent with the hypothesis that the beta subunit is not a major determinant in the action of this drug at the adult muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.",

The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming \u03b1-subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+) channel in the heart, which plays a critical role in cardiac action potential repolarization. Dysfunction of IKr causes long QT syndrome, a cardiac electrical disorder that predisposes affected individuals to fatal arrhythmias and sudden death. The homeostasis of hERG channels in the plasma membrane depends on a balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Our recent data indicate that hERG channels undergo enhanced endocytic degradation under low potassium (hypokalemia) conditions. The GTPase Rab4 is known to mediate rapid recycling of various internalized proteins to the plasma membrane. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Rab4 on the expression level of hERG channels. Our data revealed that overexpression of Rab4 decreases the expression level of hERG in the plasma membrane. Rab4 does not affect the expression level of the Kv1.5 or EAG K(+) channels. Mechanistically, our data demonstrate that overexpression of Rab4 increases the expression level of endogenous Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin ligase that targets hERG but not Kv1.5 or EAG channels for ubiquitination and degradation. Nedd4-2 undergoes self- ubiquitination and degradation. Rab4 interferes with Nedd4-2 degradation, resulting in an increased expression level of Nedd4-2, which targets hERG. In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel pathway for hERG regulation; Rab4 decreases the hERG density at the plasma membrane by increasing the endogenous Nedd4-2 expression.",

It is encoded by only one gene in the Drosophila genome and is expressed throughout the nervous system. It regulates the balance between reserve and releasable vesicles, is required to maintain transmission upon heavy demand, and is essential for proper memory function at the behavioral level. Task-relevant sensorimotor functions, however, remain intact in the absence of Synapsin. Using an odor-sugar reward associative learning paradigm in larval Drosophila, we show that memory scores in mutants lacking Synapsin (syn(97)) are lower than in wild-type animals only when more salient, higher concentrations of odor or of the sugar reward are used. Furthermore, we show that Synapsin is selectively required for larval short-term memory. Thus, without Synapsin Drosophila larvae can learn and remember, but Synapsin is required to form memories that match in strength to event salience-in particular to a high saliency of odors, of rewards, or the salient recency of an event. We further show that the residual memory scores upon a lack of Synapsin are not further decreased by an additional lack of the Sap47 protein. In combination with mass spectrometry data showing an up-regulated phosphorylation of Synapsin in the larval nervous system upon a lack of Sap47, this is suggestive of a functional interdependence of Synapsin and Sap47.",

OBJECTIVE: Melioidosis is a frequent cause of severe sepsis in Southeast Asia caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Patients with melioidosis have elevated circulating levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, an important regulator of fibrinolysis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of tissue-type plasminogen activator during melioidosis. DESIGN: Animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Wild-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator-deficient C57BL/6 mice. INTERVENTIONS: Mice were intranasally infected with viable Burkholderia pseudomallei and killed after 24, 48, or 72 hrs for harvesting of lungs, liver, and blood. Additionally, survival studies were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Experimentally induced melioidosis was associated with elevated levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator in lungs of infected wild-type mice. During infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, tissue-type plasminogen activator-deficient mice were protected when compared to wild-type mice as demonstrated by a strongly decreased mortality (62% vs. 100% amongst wild-type mice, p < .0001), together with decreased pulmonary bacterial loads, less severe histopathological scores, and decreased fibrinolysis. These results were accompanied with an early increase in cytokine levels in tissue-type plasminogen activator-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: During severe gram-negative sepsis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, endogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator has harmful effects with respect to survival and pulmonary bacterial growth. These effects are related to tissue-type plasminogen activator-associated plasmin-induced fibrinolysis and/or a tissue-type plasminogen activator-associated decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production.",

Previously, we showed that macroautophagy is necessary for conidiation in the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we analyzed the physiological function(s) of selective autophagy in Magnaporthe through targeted deletion of MGG_12832, an ortholog of yeast SNX41 and ATG20/SNX42. Loss of MGG_12832 (hereafter SNX41) abolished conidia formation and pathogenesis in M. oryzae. Snx41-GFP localized as dynamic puncta or short tubules that are partially associated with autophagosomes and/or autophagic vacuoles. PX domain, but not macroautophagy per se, was required for such localization of Snx41-GFP in Magnaporthe. Although not required for nonselective autophagy, Snx41 was essential for pexophagy in Magnaporthe. We identified Oxp1, an ATP-dependent oxoprolinase in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, as a binding partner and potential retrieval target of Snx41-dependent protein sorting. The substrate of Oxp1, 5-oxoproline, could partially restore conidiation in the snx41\u0394. Exogenous glutathione, a product of the gamma-glutamyl cycle, significantly restored pathogenicity in the snx41\u0394 mutant, likely through counteracting the oxidative stress imposed by the host. We propose that the gamma-glutamyl cycle and glutathione biosynthesis are subject to regulation by Snx41-dependent vesicular trafficking, and mediate antioxidant defense crucial for in planta growth and pathogenic differentiation of Magnaporthe at the onset of blast disease in rice.",

TFTs (serum thyrotropin [TSH], free thyroxine [FT4] and total triiodothyronine [T3] concentrations) were completed for each patient on 3 occasions: at admission, at hospital discharge and at their first outpatient visit. TFTs were related to clinical and analytical data. Thirty-five patients (16 women [45.7%], mean age \u00b1 SD, 65.2 \u00b1 18.0 years) with AKI (creatinine 5.6 \u00b1 2.2 mg/dL) were studied. There were 10 (28.6%), 10 (28.6%), 11 (31.4%) and 4 (11.4%) patients with prerenal, renal, mixed (prerenal and renal), and postrenal AKI, respectively. RESULTS: Total prevalence of alterations in TFTs was 82.9% (n=29). Of those, euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) with low T3 only was the most common (n=13, 37.1%) derangement. In the whole group of patients, median TSH (0.93 \u00b5U/mL, interquartile range 0.35-2.27 \u00b5U/mL)and mean FT4 (1.2 \u00b1 0.3 ng/dL) were normal, whereas mean T3 was low (0.7 \u00b1 0.1 ng/mL). TSH, FT4 and T3 were similar in different types of AKI. On simple regression analysis, we found a negative correlation only between TSH and serum urea concentrations (ro=-0.382; p=0.024). At hospital discharge (median hospital stay 6 days; range 2-10 days), TFT showed significant changes only in T3 concentrations (0.8 \u00b1 0.3 ng/mL, p=0.013). At this point, the percentage of patients with normal TFT increased from 17.1% at baseline to 40% at discharge and then to 66.7% at their first outpatient visit. We found no association between the presence and type of alterations in TFT and clinical factors (sex, age, personal history of diabetes and/or hypertension, number and type of drugs used, number of signs and symptoms at AKI diagnosis, and degree, type and cause of AKI) or prognostic factors (hospital stay, recovery of renal function, need for renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis, development and degree of residual chronic renal failure and mortality) associated with AKI. CONCLUSION: Over 80% of AKI patients exhibit alterations in TFT. The commonest derangement is ESS (~70%), mainly low T3 syndrome, which is present in about one third of the patients with altered TFT. ESS recovers spontaneously as renal function improves. The presence of TFT alterations seems to not be associated with clinical and prognostic implications in AKI patients.",

OBJECTIVE: Recent advances have led to novel identification of genetic polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically. The aim of the present study was to independently replicate 3 recently described RA susceptibility loci, STAT4, IL2/IL21, and CTLA4, in a large Dutch case-control cohort, and to perform a meta-analysis of all published studies to date and investigate the relevance of the findings in clinically well-defined subgroups of RA patients with or without autoantibodies. METHODS: The STAT4, IL2/IL21, and CTLA4 gene polymorphisms (rs7574865, rs6822844, and rs3087243, respectively) were genotyped in 877 RA patients and 866 healthy individuals. A meta-analysis of all published studies of disease association with these polymorphisms was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects method. RESULTS: An association of STAT4, IL2/IL21, and CTLA4 with RA was detected in Dutch patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.19 [P=0.031], OR 0.84 [P=0.051], and OR 0.87 [P=0.041], respectively). Results from the meta-analysis confirmed an association of all 3 polymorphisms with RA in Caucasians (OR 1.24 [P=1.66x10(-11)], OR 0.78 [P=5.6x10(-5)], and OR 0.91 [P=1.8x10(-3)], respectively). The meta-analysis also revealed that STAT4 predisposed to disease development equally in patients with autoantibodies and those without autoantibodies, and that CTLA4 enhanced the development of anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive RA as compared with ACPA-negative RA. CONCLUSION: Our results replicate and firmly establish the association of STAT4 and CTLA4 with RA and provide highly suggestive evidence for IL2/IL21 loci as a risk factor for RA. Given the strong statistical power of our meta-analysis to confirm a true-positive association, these findings provide considerable support for the involvement of CTLA4 in distinct subsets of RA patients.",

Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a dreadful disease common in South-East Asia and Northern Australia and is characterized by chronic suppurative lesions and pneumonia. Melioidosis may evolve into severe sepsis with multi-organ failure with high mortalities, despite proper antibiotic therapy. Besides activation of a strong pro-inflammatory host response, the coagulation system plays an important role during melioidosis, which is thought to be host-protective. In particular, a procoagulant state together with downregulation of anticoagulant pathways and activation of fibrinolysis are present, all closely interrelated with parameters of inflammation. This review presents an overview of recent studies in which the role of coagulation, anti-coagulation and fibrinolysis during melioidosis was investigated both in patients and in experimental settings.",

Ultrasound is among the most widely used biomedical imaging modalities, but has limited ability to image specific molecular targets due to the lack of suitable nanoscale contrast agents. Gas vesicles-genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes-have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound. Their unique physical properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mechanical, acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins. Here, we demonstrate that genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific molecular targeting.

Blood plasma of pregnant women contains circulating cell-free fetal DNA (ccffDNA), originating from the placenta. The use of this DNA for non-invasive detection of fetal aneuploidies using massively parallel sequencing (MPS)-by-synthesis has been proven previously. Sequence performance may, however, depend on the MPS platform and therefore we have explored the possibility for multiplex MPS-by-ligation, using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD(\u2122) 4 system. DNA isolated from plasma samples from 52 pregnant women, carrying normal or aneuploid fetuses, was sequenced in multiplex runs of 4, 8 or 16 samples simultaneously. The sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome and quantified according to their genomic location. In case of a fetal aneuploidy, the number of reads of the aberrant chromosome is expected to be higher or lower than in normal reference samples. To statistically determine this, Z-scores per chromosome were calculated as described previously, with thresholds for aneuploidies set at > +3.0 and < -3.0 for chromosomal over- or underrepresentation, respectively. All samples from fetal aneuploidies yielded Z-scores outside the thresholds for the aberrant chromosomes, with no false negative or positive results. Full-blown fetal aneuploidies can thus be reliably detected in maternal plasma using a multiplex MPS-by-ligation approach. Furthermore, the results obtained with a sample from a pregnancy with 45,X in the cytotrophoblastic cell layer and 46,XX in the mesenchymal core cells show that ccffDNA originates from the cytotrophoblastic cell layer. Discrepancies between the genetic constitution of this cell layer and the fetus itself are well known, and therefore, care should be taken when translating results to the fetus itself.",

Genome-wide association studies have shown significant association of OATP1B1 and UGT1A1 with elevations of unconjugated bilirubin, and OATP1B1 inhibition data correlated with clinical unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia for several compounds. 2.

To investigate the intrinsic inhibition by the drugs, both in vivo Fi (fraction of intrinsic inhibition) and R-value (estimated maximum in vivo inhibition) for OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and UGT1A1 were calculated. 3.

AIMS: Polymorphisms of genes involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes underlie the divergent drug responses among individuals. Despite some successes in identifying these polymorphisms, the candidate gene approach suffers from insufficient gene coverage whereas the genome-wide association approach is limited by less than ideal coverage of SNPs in some important genes. To expand the potential of the candidate approach, we aim to delineate a comprehensive network of drug-response genes for in-depth genetic studies. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pharmacologically important genes were extracted from various sources including literatures and web resources. These genes, along with their homologs and regulatory miRNAs, were organized based on their pharmacological functions and weighted by literature evidence and confidence levels. Their coverage was evaluated by analyzing three commercial SNP chips commonly used for genome-wide association studies: Affymetrix SNP array 6.0, Illumina HumanHap1M and Illumina Omni. RESULTS: A panel of drug-response genes was constructed, which contains 923 pharmacokinetic genes, 703 pharmacodynamic genes and 720 miRNAs. There are only 16.7% of these genes whose all known SNPs can be directly or indirectly (r(2) > 0.8) captured by the SNP chips with coverage of more than 80%. This is possibly because these SNPs chips have notably poor performance over rare SNPs and miRNA genes. CONCLUSION: We have compiled a panel of candidate genes that may be pharmacologically important. Using this knowledgebase, we are able to systematically evaluate genes and their variants that govern an individual's response to a given pharmaceutical therapy. This approach can serve as a necessary complement to genome-wide associations.",

Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. These consist of polypeptides but also non-protein factors and are metabolically active molecules belonging to different functional categories like immunity (complement factors, haptoglobin), endocrine function (leptin, sex steroids, various growth factors), metabolic function (fatty acids, adiponectin, resistin), and cardiovascular function (angiotensinogen, PAI-1). Recent advances using genomic and proteomic approaches have identified numerous new adipocyte secreted factors whose function remain to be established. Too little as well as too much adipose tissue leads to metabolic disturbances like insulin resistance. Visceral obesity is especially strongly correlated with the development of diabetes, hypertension and cardio-vascular disease. Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is a means to dissipate excess energy, but in adult humans brown fat is very scarce and probably not functional. However, human white adipose tissue contains mesenchymal stem cells, and if these could be stimulated to differentiate into brown adipocytes, increased energy expenditure in white fat could help to shift energy balance towards a more negative state.",

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the impact of major disease states, including depression, in the loss of productivity in the workplace and how integration of health care can decrease cost to employers. SUMMARY: The majority of costs associated with depressive illness can be traced to lost productivity, and the employer, therefore, bears most of the economic burden. Efforts to improve employee health and productivity have been hampered by the compartmentalization of medical costs, pharmacy costs, behavioral health costs, and productivity measures. This situation can be rectified by \"busting\" these silos and promoting a reintegration of prospective costs and parties. Health risk assessments enable employers to identify illnesses that are suitable targets for integrated health and productivity management programs. In the case of depression, employers can act proactively to identify employees at risk, working to minimize risk factors such as stress before these individuals become heavy utilizers of company resources. For employees who are currently depressed, recent research evidence has demonstrated that pharmacotherapy can have a dramatic and positive effect on lost productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism. The selection of antidepressants and subsequent follow-up must be improved, however, if the benefits of pharmacotherapy are to be optimized. CONCLUSION: Understanding the linkage of disease management and productivity in the workplace can result in dramatic decreases in absenteeism and presenteeism and increased cost savings to the employers.",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes joint inflammation and extra-articular manifestations. To prevent progressive and irreversible structural damage, early diagnosis of RA is of paramount importance. Antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins and peptides (ACPAs) are the most specific serological markers available for diagnosing RA. ACPAs may be detected several years before symptoms appear, and their presence at disease onset is a good predictor of the development of erosive joint lesions. Synthetic peptides can replace cognate proteins in solid-phase assays for specific autoantibody recognition in RA patients. The use of synthetic peptides instead of proteins represents an advantage in terms of the reproducibility of such immunoassays. They give absolute control over the exact epitopes presented. Furthermore, it is difficult to prepare sufficient amounts of high-quality antigenic proteins with a well-defined degree of citrullination. Synthetic citrullinated peptides, in contrast, are easily obtained in a pure form with a well-defined chemical structure and the epitopes can be precisely oriented in the plate by covalent binding of the peptides. We have recently obtained and highlighted the application of chimeric peptides bearing different citrullinated protein domains for the design of RA diagnosis systems. Our results indicate that more than one serological test is required to classify RA patients based on the presence or absence of ACPAs. Each of the target molecules reported (fibrin, vimentin and filaggrin) helps to identify a particular subset of RA patients.",

Dysfunctions in SERCA:PLN interactions have been implicated as having a critical role in cardiac disease, and targeting Ca(2+) transport has been demonstrated to be a promising avenue in treating conditions of heart failure. Here, we designed a series of new mutants able to tune SERCA function, targeting the loop sequence that connects the transmembrane and cytoplasmic helices of PLN. We found that a variable degree of loss of inhibition mutants is attainable by engineering glycine mutations along PLN's loop domain. Remarkably, a double glycine mutation results in a complete loss-of-function mutant, fully mimicking the phosphorylated state of PLN. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we rationalized the effects of these mutations in terms of entropic control on PLN function, whose inhibitory function can be modulated by increasing its conformational dynamics. However, if PLN mutations go past a threshold set by the phosphorylated state, they break the structural coupling between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, resulting in a species that behaves as the inhibitory transmembrane domain alone. These studies provide new potential candidates for gene therapy to reverse the effects of heart failure.",

BACKGROUND: Carcinoid involvement of left-sided heart valves has been reported in patients with a patent foramen ovale, carcinoid tumor of the lung, and active carcinoid syndrome with high levels of serotonin. The present study details the clinical features and surgical management of patients with carcinoid heart disease affecting both left- and right-sided valves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven patients (7 men, 4 women) with symptomatic carcinoid heart disease underwent surgery for left- and right-sided valve disease between 1989 and 1999. Mean age was 57+/-9 years, and median preoperative NYHA class was 3. All patients had metastatic carcinoid tumors and were on somatostatin analog. Of 11 patients, 5 (45%) had a patent foramen ovale; 1 of these also had a primary lung carcinoid tumor. Surgery included tricuspid valve replacement in all patients, pulmonary valve replacement in 3 and valvectomy in 7, mitral valve replacement in 6 and repair in 1, aortic valve replacement in 4 and repair in 2, CABG in 2, and patent foramen ovale closure in 5. One myocardial metastatic carcinoid tumor was removed. There were 2 perioperative deaths. At a mean follow-up of 41 months, 4 additional patients were dead. All but 1 surgical survivor initially improved >/=1 functional class. No patient required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Carcinoid heart disease may affect left- and right-sided valves and occurred without intracardiac shunting in 55% of this surgical series. Despite metastatic disease that limits longevity, operative survivors had improvement in functional capacity. Cardiac surgery should be considered for select patients with carcinoid heart disease affecting left- and right-sided valves.",

As a result of this process, markers in the proximity of genes influencing breed-defining traits will have reduced variation (a selective sweep) and will show divergence in allele frequency. Consequently, low-resolution genomic scans can potentially be used to identify regions containing genes that have a major influence on breed-defining traits. We model the process of breed formation and show that the probability of two or three adjacent marker loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one breed (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable and moderately spaced markers are utilized. We also use simulations with selection to demonstrate that even a moderately spaced set of highly polymorphic markers (e.g., one every 0.8 cM) has high power to detect regions targeted by strong artificial selection in dogs. Further, we show that a gene responsible for black coat color in the Large Munsterlander has a 40-Mb region surrounding the gene that is very low in heterozygosity for microsatellite markers. Similarly, we survey 302 microsatellite markers in the Dachshund and find three linked monomorphic microsatellite markers all within a 10-Mb region on chromosome 3. This region contains the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for achondroplasia in humans, but not in dogs.

In a previous study, we reported that intrathecal injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) slowed disease progression in G93A mutant superoxide dismutase1 transgenic mice. In this study, we found that intrathecal MSC administration vastly increased the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the spinal cord of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice (G93A mutant superoxide dismutase1 transgenic). Thus, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ALS patients, focusing on regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ; CD4(+) /CD25(high) /FoxP3(+) ) and the mRNA expression of several cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2). Peripheral blood samples were obtained from nine healthy controls (HC) and sixteen patients who were diagnosed with definite or probable ALS. Isolated PBMCs from the blood samples of all subjects were co-cultured with MSCs for 24 or 72\u00a0h. Based on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we found that co-culture with MSCs increased the Treg /total T-lymphocyte ratio in the PBMCs from both groups according to the co-culture duration. Co-culture of PBMCs with MSCs for 24\u00a0h led to elevated mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 in the PBMCs from both groups. However, after co-culturing for 72\u00a0h, although the IFN-\u03b3 mRNA level had returned to the basal level in co-cultured HC PBMCs, the IFN-\u03b3 mRNA level in co-cultured ALS PBMCs remained elevated. Additionally, the levels of IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 were markedly elevated, along with Gata3 mRNA, a Th2 transcription factor mRNA, in both HC and ALS PBMCs co-cultured for 72\u00a0h. The elevated expression of these cytokines in the co-culture supernatant was confirmed via ELISA. Furthermore, we found that the increased mRNA level of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the co-cultured MSCs was correlated with the increase in Treg induction. These findings of Treg induction and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in co-cultured ALS PBMCs provide indirect evidence that MSCs may play a role in the immunomodulation of inflammatory responses when MSC therapy is targeted to ALS patients. We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes. Treg and Th2 secret anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b2. A series of immunomodulatory mechanism provides a new strategy for ALS treatment.",

Single-cell analysis is essential for understanding the processes of cell differentiation and metabolic specialisation in rare cell types.

The development of modern mass spectrometers possessing increased sensitivity and mass accuracy in combination with nano-LC-MS/MS now enables the analysis of single-cell contents. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we have successfully identified nine unique proteins in a single-cell sample and 56 proteins from a pool of 15 single-cell samples from glucosinolate-rich S-cells by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, thus establishing the proof-of-concept for true single-cell proteomic analysis. Dehydrin (ERD14_ARATH), two myrosinases (BGL37_ARATH and BGL38_ARATH), annexin (ANXD1_ARATH), vegetative storage proteins (VSP1_ARATH and VSP2_ARATH) and four proteins belonging to the S-adenosyl-l-methionine cycle (METE_ARATH, SAHH1_ARATH, METK4_ARATH and METK1/3_ARATH) with associated adenosine kinase (ADK1_ARATH), were amongst the proteins identified in these single-S-cell samples. Comparison of the functional groups of proteins identified in S-cells with epidermal/cortical cells and whole tissue provided a unique insight into the metabolism of S-cells. We conclude that S-cells are metabolically active and contain the machinery for de novo biosynthesis of methionine, a precursor for the most abundant glucosinolate glucoraphanine in these cells. Moreover, since abundant TGG2 and TGG1 peptides were consistently found in single-S-cell samples, previously shown to have high amounts of glucosinolates, we suggest that both myrosinases and glucosinolates can be localised in the same cells, but in separate subcellular compartments. The complex membrane structure of S-cells was reflected by the presence of a number of proteins involved in membrane maintenance and cellular organisation.",

The molecular basis for the prevalence of blood group O in regions where malaria is endemic remains unclear. In some genetic backgrounds oxidative modifications have been linked to a reduced susceptibility to severe malaria disease. Through redox proteomics, we detected differences in carbonylated membrane proteins among the different blood groups, both in Plasmodium-infected and uninfected erythrocytes (RBC). Carbonylation profiles of RBC membrane proteins revealed that group O blood shows a reduced protein oxidation pattern compared to groups A, B and AB. Upon infection with Plasmodium falciparum Dd2, erythrocytes of all blood groups showed increased oxidation of membrane proteins. By examining 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) we observed that, upon malaria infection, the protein components of lipid rafts and cytoskeleton were the main targets of 4-HNE carbonylation in all blood groups. Ankyrins and protein bands 4.2 and 4.1 were differentially carbonylated in group O as compared to A and B groups. During trophozoite maturation in group O erythrocytes, a steady increase was observed in the number of 4-HNE-modified proteins, suggesting a parasite-driven 4-HNE-carbonylation process. Our findings indicate a possible correlation between the protection against severe malaria in blood group O individuals and a specific pattern of 4-HNE-carbonylation of cytoskeleton proteins.",

Insulating domains in Rap1p coincide with previously described transcription activation domains, whereas four adjacent subdomains spanning the whole of the Abf1p C terminus (440-731) were found to display autonomous insulating capacity. That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between physical frailty at baseline and depressive symptoms at baseline and at follow-up. DESIGN: Four-year prospective study. SETTING: Communities in the South East Region of Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data of 1827 older Chinese adults aged 55 and above in the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study-I. MEASUREMENTS: The frailty phenotype (based on Fried criteria) was determined at baseline, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale > 5) at baseline and follow-ups at 2 and 4 years. RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 65.9 (standard deviation 7.26). At baseline, 11.4% (n = 209) had depressive symptoms, 32.4% (n = 591) were prefrail and 2.5% (n = 46) were frail. In cross-sectional analysis of baseline data, the adjusted odds ratios (OR)s and 95% confidence intervals controlling for demographic, comorbidities, and other confounders were 1.69 (1.23-2.33) for prefrailty and 2.36 (1.08-5.15) for frailty, (P for linear trend <.001). In longitudinal data analyses, prospective associations among all participants were: prefrail: OR = 1.86 (1.08-3.20); frail: OR = 3.09 (1.12-8.50); (P for linear trend = .009). Among participants free of depressive symptoms at baseline, similar prospective associations were found: prefrail OR = 2.26 (1.12-4.57); frail: OR = 3.75 (1.07-13.16); (P for linear trend = .009). CONCLUSION: These data support a significant role of frailty as a predictor of depression in a relatively younger old Chinese population. Further observational and interventional studies should explore short-term dynamic and bidirectional associations and the effects of frailty reversal on depression risk.",

CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. RLS severity and burden vary widely, and the condition may require long-term treatment. OBJECTIVE: To review the comparative effectiveness, efficacy, and safety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for RLS. DATA SOURCES: We searched bibliographic databases MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase, and Natural Standards through June 2012. REVIEW METHODS: Eligible efficacy studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of individuals with RLS published in English that lasted at least 4 weeks and compared pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments with placebo or active treatment. We assessed RLS symptom impact, sleep scale scores, disease-specific quality of life, withdrawals, and adverse effects. We included observational studies that assessed long-term (>6 months) treatment adverse effects and withdrawals. RESULTS: Of the 53 studies included, one active comparator and 33 placebo-controlled RCTs provided efficacy and harms data, and 18 observational studies assessed long-term harms and adherence. RCTs were typically small and of short duration, and enrolled adult subjects with severe primary RLS of long duration. Placebo-controlled RCTs (18 trials) demonstrated that dopamine agonists (pramipexole, rotigotine, ropinirole, and cabergoline) increased the percentage of subjects who had a clinically important response defined as \u226550 percent reduction from baseline in mean International RLS symptom scale scores (IRLS responders) (risk ratio [RR]=1.60; [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38 to 1.86], k=7), improved RLS symptom scores, patient-reported sleep scale scores (effect size=0.38; [95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46], k=8), and disease-specific quality of life (effect size=\u22120.37; [95% CI: \u22120.48 to \u22120.27], k=9). Dopamine agonists resulted in more patients who experienced at least one adverse event (high-strength evidence for all outcomes). Long-term augmentation (drug-induced worsening of symptoms) and treatment withdrawal were common. Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence). Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose reduced IRLS symptom scale scores versus placebo (k=1, moderate strength of evidence). Four studies assessed nonpharmacologic interventions. Compression stockings but not the botanical extract valerian improved IRLS symptom scale scores more than sham or placebo treatments. Strength of evidence was moderate for compression stockings and low for valerian. Exercise improved symptoms more than control (low-strength evidence). Near-infrared light treatment improved IRLS symptom scores more than sham (low-strength evidence). Two trials compared active treatments. In one small crossover trial, pramipexole and levodopa/benserazide resulted in similar improvements in IRLS scores (low-strength evidence). Cabergoline improved IRLS scores and resulted in less augmentation than levodopa (moderate-strength evidence). Iron improved symptoms in adults with iron deficiency (k=2) (low-strength evidence). No studies enrolled pregnant women, children, or those with end-stage renal disease. Withdrawal from mostly dopamine agonist and levodopa treatment at 1 year or more ranged from 13 to 57 percent. Treatment withdrawals were due to lack of efficacy (6% to 37%) as well as augmentation and other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, dopamine agonists and alpha-2-delta ligands reduce RLS symptoms and improve patient-reported sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life. Adverse effects of pharmacologic therapies and long-term treatment withdrawals due to adverse effects or lack of efficacy are common. Long-term effectiveness as well as applicability for adults with milder or less frequent RLS symptoms, individuals with secondary RLS, and children is unknown.",

Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Indeed, SU(VAR)3-7 is sumoylated at lysine K839; this modification is required for localization of SU(VAR)3-7 at pericentric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeres. In addition, sumoylation of SU(VAR)3-7 is a prerequisite for its ability to enhance position-effect variegation.

Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity. Regulation of FOXO transcriptional activity occurs mainly through a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Here we describe nemo-like kinase (NLK) as a novel regulator of FOXOs. NLK binds to and phosphorylates FOXO1, FOXO3a, and FOXO4 on multiple residues. NLK acts as a negative regulator of FOXO transcriptional activity. For FOXO4 we show that NLK-mediated loss of FOXO4 activity co-occurs with inhibition of FOXO4 monoubiquitination. Previously, we have shown that oxidative stress-induced monoubiquitination of FOXO4 stimulates its transactivation, which leads to activation of an antioxidant defensive program. Conversely, NLK-dependent inhibition of FOXO4 activity can provide a means to downregulate this defensive program, when oxidative stress reaches a level beyond which repair is no longer feasible and cells need to undergo apoptosis.",

We conducted a randomized double-blind study to assess the safety and effectiveness of short-term sedation with propofol in adult patients immediately after cardiac surgery. Sixty hemodynamically stable adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to receive propofol postoperatively or no postoperative sedation. The propofol group (n = 30) received propofol infusion (1 mg.kg-1.hr-1) immediately after they awoke postoperatively. The infusion rates were adjusted to maintain a sedation level (Ramsay score) of 3. Nurses assessed the effectiveness of the sedation according to Ramsay scores; the patients also subjectively evaluated sedation. Postoperative pulmonary oxygenation dysfunction (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg) was noted in 10 patients receiving propofol and in eight patients in the control group. The dysfunction was greatly improved after overnight ventilator support, and this improvement was not affected by propofol sedation. The propofol group received an average of 13.6 +/- 5.3 hours of propofol infusion, at an average infusion rate of 0.96 +/- 0.16 mg.kg-1.hr-1. Patients receiving propofol remained well sedated (Ramsay score > or = 2) during 99.3% of the study period, while the control patients remained anxious or agitated (Ramsay score, 1) during 12% of the study period. Patients receiving propofol were successfully extubated 9 +/- 4 minutes after cessation of propofol infusion, without complications. The turnover of intensive care unit beds was not delayed by propofol sedation. Subjective evaluations (scored on an analog scale: 0 = nil, 10 = extreme) revealed that patients receiving propofol felt less pain than those in the control group (2.3 +/- 2.7 vs 4.7 +/- 3.1, p < 0.05), had better sleep quality (7.8 +/- 2.9 vs 5.1 +/- 2.9, p < 0.05), and were more satisfied with the care they received (8.3 +/- 2.2 vs 5.8 +/- 3.9, p < 0.05). These findings suggest that propofol infusion is effective for short-term sedation of cardiac surgery patients postoperatively and that an infusion rate adequate to maintain a Ramsay score of 3 may be ideal. Postoperative sedation should be considered for all cardiac surgery patients, not only those with outward signs of anxiety or agitation.",

Although major advances have been made in the treatment of RA, relatively little is known about disease pathogenesis. Autoantibodies, present in approximately 60\u00a0% of the patients with early disease, might provide indications for immunological mechanisms underlying RA. Among the RA-associated autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively in the last decade. The discovery of ACPAs resulted into novel insight in RA pathogenesis and allowed division of the heterogeneous entity of RA into an ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative subset of disease. Other autoantibodies discovered in the serum of RA patients, including rheumatoid factors (RFs) targeting human IgG and anti-peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD)3/4 antibodies reactive against and activating the enzyme involved in citrullination, might contribute in collaboration with ACPAs to a feed-forward loop to aggravate erosive outcome of disease. Recently, a novel autoantibody system associated with RA was identified. These autoantibodies recognize carbamylated proteins (anti-CarP antibodies) and are detected in approximately 20\u00a0% of ACPA-negative patients, suggesting another parameter to sub-classify RA.

BACKGROUND: We recently conducted a comprehensive review of the psychiatric inclusion/exclusion criteria used in 170 placebo-controlled antidepressant efficacy trials (AETs) published during the past 20 years and found that the criteria of more recent studies were significantly more restrictive than prior studies. Vortioxetine is the most recently approved medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We compared the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the vortioxetine studies to the criteria used in other AETs, and discuss the broader issue of the generalizability of AETs and the implications this might have for the labeling of antidepressants receiving FDA approval. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of placebo-controlled AETs published from January, 1995 through December, 2014. We identified 170 AETs published during this 20 year period and compared the inclusion/exclusion criteria used in the 12 studies of vortioxetine to those used in the nonvortioxetine studies. A second analysis compared vortioxetine to the 3 antidepressants most recently approved prior to vortioxetine (desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran extended release, vilazodone). RESULTS: Compared to the nonvortioxetine AETs, the vortioxetine studies significantly more often excluded patients with any comorbid Axis I disorder (p<.001) and more often required the current depressive episode to be longer than the DSM minimum symptom duration requirement of 2 weeks (p<.01). The cutoff on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale required for inclusion in the vortioxetine studies was higher than the cutoff used in the other AETs (p<.01). LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the present analysis is that it was based on published placebo-controlled studies of antidepressants. CONCLUSION: The inclusion/exclusion criteria in the studies of vortioxetine were more restrictive than the criteria used in other AETs. Inconsistent with FDA guidelines on the labeling of medications, the label of vortioxetine does not include a description of the limits to the group of patients with MDD for whom the medication has been shown to be effective.",

METHODS: Eleven EZH2-derived peptides were prepared based on the HLA-A24 binding motif.

INTRODUCTION: Kummell's disease is an avascular necrosis of the vertebral body, secondary to a vertebral compression fracture. This entity is characterised by the gradual development in time of a vertebral body collapse following a trivial spinal trauma, involving a worsening back pain associated with a progressive kyphosis. PURPOSES: The aim of this article is to carry out an international literature review regarding Kummell's disease, addressing its physiopathology, histopathology, clinical presentation, radiological characteristics and treatment modalities; at the same time, the literature is updated through the description of a new and interesting case, symbol of the pathology long-term potential complications, if not diagnosed and therefore not suitably treated. CASE REPORT: A patient with osteoporosis, following a slight spinal trauma, suffered a progressive necrosis of the D11 body; although the radiological exams showed a constant worsening of the thoracic-lumbar kyphosis and a restriction of the spinal canal, in another medical centre he was only treated with a corset and painkillers. A year after the injury, motor deficits concerning the lower limbs appeared. He was then sent to us and indication for posterior internal fixation was given. On the basis of both his medical history and radiological and histological findings, Kummell's disease was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to have a complete knowledge of the clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of Kummell's disease, so as to follow a correct diagnostic course enabling to prepare the most suitable therapy.",

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of chronic cocaine on dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) synthesis in several rat brain regions implicated in drug reinforcement. Male rats were treated twice daily with cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline for 1 week. After 42 hr of abstinence, rats were challenged with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline, followed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, ip). Animals were decapitated 30 min after NSD-1015 and discrete brain regions were microdisected from 300 microns frozen sections. Postmortem tissue levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 5-hyroxytryptophan (5-HTP) were quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection and used to estimate biosynthesis of DA and 5-HT, respectively. In chronic saline-treated rats, cocaine dramatically suppressed DA and 5-HT synthesis in all forebrain regions examined, including: medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, olfactory tubercle, and basolateral amygdala. The degree of inhibition ranged from 35-65% and was more pronounced in 5-HT neurons compared to DA neurons in the same tissue sample. In general, chronic cocaine did not significantly alter basal levels of DOPA or 5-HTP; a notable exception was lateral hypothalamus, where chronic cocaine reduced basal DA synthesis to 75% of control. After repeated cocaine injections, the synthesis-inhibiting effect of a challenge injection of cocaine was attenuated in many brain areas. These data suggest that whereas acute cocaine decreases DA and 5-HT synthesis in forebrain, chronic cocaine is not neurotoxic to DA and 5-HT neurons. In addition, the mechanism(s) mediating cocaine-induced suppression of monoamine synthesis may become desensitized by chronic exposure to the drug.",

BACKGROUND: Various human cardiovascular pathophysiological conditions associate aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and circulating miRNAs are emerging as promising biomarkers. In mice, myocardial miR-21 overexpression is related to cardiac fibrosis elicited by pressure overload. This study was designed to determine the role of myocardial and plasmatic miR-21 in the maladaptive remodeling of the extracellular matrix induced by pressure overload in aortic stenosis (AS) patients and the clinical value of miR-21 as a biomarker for pathological myocardial fibrosis. METHODS: In left ventricular biopsies from 75 AS patients and 32 surgical controls, we quantified the myocardial transcript levels of miR-21, miR-21-targets and ECM- and TGF-\u03b2-signaling-related elements. miR-21 plasma levels were determined in 25 healthy volunteers and in AS patients. In situ hybridization of miR-21 was performed in myocardial sections. RESULTS: The myocardial and plasma levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in the AS patients compared with the controls and correlated directly with the echocardiographic mean transvalvular gradients. miR-21 overexpression was confined to interstitial cells and absent in cardiomyocytes. Using bootstrap validated multiple linear regression, the variance in myocardial collagen expression was predicted by myocardial miR-21 (70% of collagen variance) or plasma miR-21 (52% of collagen variance), together with the miR-21 targets RECK and PDCD4, and effectors of TGF-\u00df signaling.

The tumor-suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC1, on chromosome 10q23.3, has been implicated in an important number of human tumors, such as thyroid carcinomas. PTEN somatic mutations occur in sporadic tumors of the endometrium, brain, prostate, or melanomas, while germline mutations predispose to development of the multiple hamartoma syndromes (i.e., Cowden's disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome). Activation of the two alleles of PTEN is required for its tumor-suppression role. Because the frequency of PTEN suppression in thyroid tumors exceeds that of PTEN mutations or deletions, it is very likely that epigenetic mechanisms, such as promoter hypermethylation, may account for its inactivation in a subset of tumors. The main aim of this study was to assess the frequency of promoter hypermethylation of PTEN in thyroid tumors. We studied frozen tissue samples from 46 papillary carcinomas, 7 follicular carcinomas, 6 follicular adenomas as well as 39 normal thyroid tissue samples. Methylation-specific polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) with three different sets of primers was used. Two of the primer sets were designed to avoid any interference with PTEN pseudogene promoter. PTEN promoter hypermethylation was detected in 21 of 46 (45.7%) papillary carcinomas, 6 of 7 follicular carcinomas, and 5 of 6 follicular adenomas. It was negative in all normal tissues. Negative immunohistochemical staining for PTEN was significantly associated with the presence of promoter hypermethylation (p < 0.001). These results show a high frequency of PTEN promoter hypermethylation, especially in follicular tumors, suggesting its possible role in thyroid tumorigenesis.",

MCT8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid tests. The great majority of affected children cannot walk or talk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue hypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone is ineffective. In Mct8-deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT8 to enter tissues and could be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect and efficacy of DITPA in children with MCT8 deficiency. METHODS: This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on compassionate grounds for 26-40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8.5-25 months, beginning with a small dose of 1.8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg/d (2.1-2.4 mg/kg \u00b7 d), given in three divided doses. RESULTS: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg \u00b7 d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The following significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all subjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). Cholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain occurred in two. None of the treated children required a gastric feeding tube or developed seizures. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: DITPA (1-2 mg/kg \u00b7 d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and reduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss.

Defective DNA damage response (DDR) can result in genomic instability (GIN) and lead to the transformation into cancer. P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved DDR proteins. Because 53BP1 molecules localize at the sites of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and rapidly form nuclear foci, the presence of 53BP1 foci can be considered as a cytologic marker for endogenous DSBs reflecting GIN. Although it has been proposed that GIN has a crucial role in the progression of thyroid neoplasms, the significance of GIN during thyroid tumorigenesis remains unclear, particularly in patients. We analyzed, therefore, the level of GIN, as detected with immunofluorescence of 53BP1, in 40 cases of resected thyroid tissues. This study demonstrated a number of nuclear 53BP1 foci in thyroid cancers, suggesting a constitutive activation of DDR in thyroid cancer cells. Because follicular adenoma also showed a few 53BP1 nuclear foci, GIN might be induced at a precancerous stage of thyroid tumorigenesis. Furthermore, high-grade thyroid cancers prominently exhibited an intense and heterogeneous nuclear staining of 53BP1 immunoreactivity, which was also observed in radiation-associated cancers and in mouse colonic crypts as a delayed response to a high dose ionizing radiation, suggesting increased GIN with progression of cancer. Thus, the present study demonstrated a difference in the staining pattern of 53BP1 during thyroid carcinogenesis. We propose that immunofluorescence analysis of 53BP1 expression can be a useful tool to estimate the level of GIN and, simultaneously, the malignant potency of human thyroid tumors.",

Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited chromosomal instability disorder characterized by childhood aplastic anemia, developmental abnormalities and cancer predisposition. One of the hallmark phenotypes of FA is cellular hypersensitivity to agents that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), such as mitomycin C (MMC). FA is caused by mutation in at least 14 genes which function in the resolution of ICLs during replication. The FA proteins act within the context of a protein network in coordination with multiple repair factors that function in distinct pathways. SNM1B/Apollo is a member of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase/\u03b2CASP family of nucleases and has been demonstrated to function in ICL repair. However, the relationship between SNM1B and the FA protein network is not known. In the current study, we establish that SNM1B functions epistatically to the central FA factor, FANCD2, in cellular survival after ICL damage and homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We also demonstrate that MMC-induced chromosomal anomalies are increased in SNM1B-depleted cells, and this phenotype is not further exacerbated upon depletion of either FANCD2 or another key FA protein, FANCI. Furthermore, we find that SNM1B is required for proper localization of critical repair factors, including FANCD2, BRCA1 and RAD51, to MMC-induced subnuclear foci.

Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns >20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns <10 kb. The predicted sites in long introns are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, despite extensive divergence of other sequences within the same introns. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Experimental analyses of in vivo processing intermediates and lariat products from four large introns in the unrelated genes kuzbanian, outspread, and Ultrabithorax confirmed that these introns are removed by a series of recursive splicing steps using the predicted nonexonic sites.

The Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a serious infectious disease of humans and animals. Once considered an esoteric tropical disease confined to Southeast Asia and northern Australia, research on B. pseudomallei has recently gained global prominence due to its classification as a potential bioterrorism agent by countries such as the United States and also by increasing numbers of case reports from regions where it is not endemic. An environmental bacterium typically found in soil and water, assessing the true global prevalence of melioidosis is challenged by the fact that clinical symptoms associated with B. pseudomallei infection are extremely varied and may be confused with diverse conditions such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, or Staphyloccocus aureus infection. These diagnostic challenges, coupled with lack of awareness among clinicians, have likely contributed to underdiagnosis and the high mortality rate of melioidosis, as initial treatment is often either inappropriate or delayed. Even after antibiotic treatment, relapses are frequent, and after resolution of acute symptoms, chronic melioidosis can also occur, and the symptoms can persist for months to years. In a recent article, Price et al. [mBio 4(4):e00388-13, 2013, doi:10.1128/mBio.00388-13] demonstrate how comparative genomic sequencing can reveal the repertoire of genetic changes incurred by B. pseudomallei during chronic human infection. Their results have significant clinical ramifications and highlight B. pseudomallei's ability to survive in a wide range of potential niches within hosts, through the acquisition of genetic adaptations that optimize fitness and resource utilization.",

INTRODUCTION: In addition to the classic triad (tremor, rigidity and akinesia), Parkinson's disease (PD) is also accompanied by several non-motor disorders. AIM: To carry out an updated review of these non-motor symptoms in terms of their pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical features and treatment. DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson. They are often neglected and remain undetected. Although they may respond to dopaminergic agents, they usually require a different therapeutic approach. Studies are needed to evaluate new therapeutic perspectives that act against the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: PD affects systems other than the dopaminergic nigrostriatal. A better understanding of this pathology will make it possible to approach and optimise the treatment of the conditioning symptoms, thereby enhancing the welfare of patients with PD.",

Gravitropism of oat (Avena sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) coleoptiles was investigated in relation to the displacement angle or to the initially set stimulation angle (SA). We measured curvature rates at the early phase of curvature, before it was affected by the drop in SA resulting from the curvature response itself. The plot of the rates against the sines of initial SAs revealed similar curves for oats and wheat, which approached saturation as the sine increased to unity. The two species and previously analyzed rice [Iino et al. (1996) Plant Cell Environ. 19: 1160] appeared to have similar gravisensitivities. Initial SAs below and over 90 degrees yielded comparable rates when the sine values were the same, indicating that the extent of gravitropism is determined by the gravity component perpendicular to the organ's long axis. Long-term curvature kinetics at different SAs indicated that the net curvature rate dropped sharply before the tip reached the vertical position and then the tip approached the vertical slowly, with clear oscillatory movements in the case of wheat. During this late curvature phase, the coleoptile straightened gradually, although none of its parts had yet reached the vertical. When rotated on horizontal clinostats or displaced upwards to reduce SA in the late curvature phase, coleoptiles bent in the opposite direction. These results demonstrated that autotropism counteracts gravitropism to straighten coleoptiles.",

It is characterized by deep painful nodules and abscesses that rupture and contribute to the formation of sinus tracks and scarring. The management of HS is based on the assessment of disease severity and a combination of medical and surgical treatment according to the European Guidelines. Adalimumab, a recombinant, fully humanized, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-\u03b1) monoclonal antibody, is the only officially approved treatment for the management of moderate-to-severe HS. Case reports, concerning 42 patients who received adalimumab for severe HS (with the standard dose regimen for psoriasis), reported a cumulative response rate of 58% ( > 50% in 23 patients) with a relapse rate of 71% (10 out of 14 patients). The most recent and most well-powered phase III, randomized placebo-controlled trials for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in treatment of moderate-to-severe HS (PIONEER studies I and II) showed that the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) rate at week 12 was significantly higher for patients randomized to adalimumab compared to placebo.

The main problem is that at the moment we do not have any therapeutical resources to help us better treat these tumours, as we can do, with others tumours like breast, lung and colorectal cancer. We have also improved on diagnostic imaging, especially with the new MRI sequences; we can now better define the characteristics of the tumour area and the surrounding brain structures, allowing us to adjust resections.

These imaging techniques allow the radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently healthy tissue.

Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes  150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature.

An increasing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress and damage play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases associated with neurodegeneration, including Down syndrome (DS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Pick's disease (PD). Although oxidative stress is a common element in these diseases, specific clinico-pathological phenotypes have been described for each disorder. Development of these phenotypes might be linked, among others, to differences in antioxidant response. The present study is designed to investigate expression of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the newly characterized family of highly conserved antioxidant enzymes, and other antioxidant enzymes in frontal cortex and cerebellum of DS, AD and PD patients using the technique of proteomics. Levels of Prx I, Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutathione-S-transferase omega1 in DS, AD and PD were not significantly different from that of controls in both brain regions investigated. In contrast, Prx II was significantly increased (P<0.05) in frontal cortex of DS, AD and PD, whereas Prx III was decreased in frontal cortex of DS (P<0.01) and PD (P<0.001). Interestingly, Prx VI displayed a significant increase (P<0.05) only in PD frontal cortex. The present data indicate that differential regulation of antioxidant enzymes exist in DS, AD and PD, suggestive of the diversity as well as distinct functional roles of these proteins. Moreover, while up-regulation of Prx II appears to provide evidence for the existence of compensatory response in increased cell loss, up-regulation of Prx VI may be used to discriminate PD from AD as well as DS.",

These homologous proteins differ at their N and C termini: the C-terminal Met-Leu-Leu in PLN is replaced by Arg-Ser-Tyr-Gln-Tyr in SLN. The role of the C-terminal sequence of SLN tagged N-terminally with the FLAG epitope (NF-SLN) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention was investigated by transfecting human embryonic kidney-293 cells with cDNAs encoding NF-SLN or a series of NF-SLN mutants in which C-terminal amino acids were deleted progressively. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of transfected cells by using anti-FLAG antibodies indicated that NF-SLN and PLN tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG epitope, even when overexpressed, were restricted to the ER. However, C-terminal truncation deletions of SLN, which lacked RSYQY, were not localized to ER and did not inhibit Ca(2+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake by SERCA. The shortest deletion constructs, NF-SLN 1-22 and NF-SLN 1-23, did not express stable protein products. However, all NF-SLN cDNA constructs, including NF-SLN 1-22 and NF-SLN 1-23, were expressed stably and localized to the ER when they were coexpressed with SERCA2a. These results show that NF-SLN subcellular distribution depends on SERCA coexpression and on its luminal, C-terminal RSYQY sequence. By using immunoprecipitation and MS, glucose-regulated protein 78/BiP and glucose-regulated protein 94 were identified as proteins that interact with NF-SLN through the RSYQY sequence. Thus, in the absence of SERCA, retention of NF-SLN in the ER is mediated through its association with other components through the C-terminal RSYQY sequence.",

AIMS: Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) is associated with mutations in more than 10 genes, but genes mutation frequencies and associated clinical features remain largely unknown. Here, we performed a mutation analysis of four genes involved in FDCM in a population of idiopathic DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: A SSCP and sequencing mutation screening of all the exons coding for beta myosin heavy chain (MYH7 gene), cardiac T troponin (TNNT2 gene), phospholamban (PLN gene), and the cardio-specific exon of metavinculin (VCL gene) were performed in 96 independent patients (54 familial and 42 sporadic). It led to the identification of eight heterozygous mutations, seven new ones in MYH7, and the already described R141W mutation in TNNT2. MYH7 mutations (in five familial and two sporadic cases) substitute residues located either in the head (I201T, T412N, A550V) or tail domains (T1019N, R1193S, E1426K, R1634S) of the protein. DCM was not associated with skeletal myopathy or conduction defects in any patients. Contrasting clinical features were observed between MYH7 and TNNT2 mutations carriers. In MYH7 vs. TNNT2, mean age at diagnosis was late (P<0.03), penetrance was incomplete in adults (56 vs. 100%), and mean age at major cardiac event was higher (P<0.04). CONCLUSION: We have identified seven mutations in MYH7, one in TNNT2, and none in PLN or in the VCL cardio-specific exon.

It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or occurs at night and in the evening. RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form, usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype without PLM and l-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an l-DOPA challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In most cases, RLS is idiopathic. It may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses of l-DOPA or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used.",

BACKGROUND: The study investigated if intraoperative use of carmustine wafers, particularly in combination with Stupp regimen, is a viable and safe first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. METHODS: Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years) with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 \u00b1 1.7) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial resection (13 months; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative use of carmustine wafers in combination with Stupp regimen is a viable first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. The prognostic value of this treatment association should be evaluated in a multicenter trial, ideally in a randomized and placebo-controlled one.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of HIV-1 subtype C strains from Bangladesh and related strains from other countries, and thereby clarify when and from where subtype C was introduced in the country and how it subsequently spread within Bangladesh. The phylogenetic analysis included 118 Bangladeshi gag sequences and 128 sequences from other countries and was performed using the BEAST package. Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of Bangladeshi sequences (97/118, 82%) fall into a large regional cluster of samples from Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar, which dates back to the early 1960's. Following its establishment in the region, this strain has entered Bangladesh multiple times from around 1975 and onwards, but extensive in-country transmission could only be detected among drug users and not through sexual transmission. In addition, there have been multiple (at least ten) introductions of subtype C to Bangladesh from outside this region, but no extensive spread could be detected for any of these. Since many HIV-infections remain undetected while asymptomatic, the true extent of the transmission of each strain remains unknown, especially among hard to reach groups such as clients of sex workers and returning migrants with families.",

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology is mostly (>95%) not inherited in a Mendelian fashion. Such sporadic AD (sAD) forms do not exhibit familial aggregation and are characterized by complex genetic inheritance. Growing evidence indicates that multiple genes contribute to sAD-characteristic endophenotypes, molecular mechanisms, signaling pathways and biomarker signatures either individually or through complex gene-gene interactions, lifestyle and the environment. DISCUSSION: Under the hypothesis that low-prevalence variants showing moderate-to-high effect size may be associated with risk for sAD, two independent research groups have demonstrated that a rare variant (rs75932628, encoding a substitution of arginine by histidine at residue 47 (R47H), in the TREM2 gene, which encodes the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to sAD. Another study has provided intriguing evidence that a low-frequency variant (rs63750847) in the APP gene is associated with a reduced risk of developing AD and a lower likelihood of age-related cognitive decline in elderly subjects without AD. SUMMARY: Recent years have witnessed tremendous development in genetics technology that has allowed full individualized genome-wide or genomic screening embracing all of the risk and protective variants for sAD, both across populations and within individuals. Hopefully, the integration of neurogenetics with systems biology and high-throughput genotyping will further pave the way to decipher all of the related causes, mechanisms, and biomarkers across the spectrum of distinct AD forms. After an almost lost apprentice decade in AD therapy development, the epoch of individualized asymptomatic screening and progress in primary and secondary prevention of sAD is probably at its dawn. Even though we are more at the beginning than at the end of sAD genetics, there is some reason for optimism given the recent identification of novel risk or protective variants (such as rare TREM2 and APP mutations) showing strong statistical associations with sAD.",

INTRODUCTION: Autonomic dysfunction (AD) can be a feature of both multiple system atrophy (MSA) and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), conditions that are frequently misdiagnosed in life. Most studies on AD in MSA and IPD are based on clinical cases without pathological verification. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed AD in 135 pathologically confirmed cases of IPD and in 33 of MSA from the UK PD Society Brain Bank. RESULTS: MSA started at a younger age than IPD (54.4 +/- 10.7 yrs versus 60.6 +/- 10.8 yrs), and AD began earlier in the course of the illness All MSA patients had some degree of AD in life whereas AD was absent in 24% of IPD patients. Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the presence of autonomic disturbance alone does not distinguish between MSA and IPD in individual cases. However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA.",

When an otherwise harmful insult to the brain is preceded by a brief, noninjurious stimulus, the brain becomes tolerant, and the resulting damage is reduced. Epileptic tolerance develops when brief seizures precede an episode of prolonged seizures (status epilepticus). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. We investigated how prior seizure preconditioning affects the miRNA response to status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid in mice. The miRNA was extracted from the ipsilateral CA3 subfield 24 hours after focal-onset status epilepticus in animals that had previously received either seizure preconditioning (tolerance) or no preconditioning (injury), and mature miRNA levels were measured using TaqMan low-density arrays. Expression of 21 miRNAs was increased, relative to control, after status epilepticus alone, and expression of 12 miRNAs was decreased. Increased miR-132 levels were matched with increased binding to Argonaute-2, a constituent of the RNA-induced silencing complex. In tolerant animals, expression responses of >40% of the injury-group-detected miRNAs differed, being either unchanged relative to control or down-regulated, and this included miR-132. In vivo microinjection of locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides (antagomirs) against miR-132 depleted hippocampal miR-132 levels and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death.

The therapeutic potential of anticancer antibodies is limited by the resistance of tumor cells to complement-mediated attack, primarily through the over-expression of membrane complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs: CD46, CD55 and CD59). Trastuzumab, an anti- HER2 monoclonal antibody, approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, exerts only minor complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC). Pertuzumab is a novel anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, which blocks HER2 dimerization with other ligand-activated HER family members. Here, we explored the complement-mediated anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive tumor cells of various histological origins. Delivery of chemically stabilized anti-mCRP siRNAs using cationic lipoplexes, AtuPLEXes, to HER2-over-expressing BT474, SK-BR-3 (breast), SKOV3 (ovarian) and Calu-3 (lung) cancer cells reduced mCRPs expression by 85-95%. Knockdown of individual complement regulators variably led to increased CDC only upon combined treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The combined down-regulation of all the three regulators augmented CDC by 48% in BT474, 46% in SK-BR-3 cells, 78% in SKOV3 cells and by 30% in Calu-3 cells and also increased complement-induced apoptosis and caspase activity on mCRP neutralized tumor cells. In addition, antibody-induced C3 opsonization of tumor cells was significantly enhanced after mCRP silencing and further augmented tumor cell killing by macrophages. Our findings suggest that siRNA-induced inhibition of complement regulator expression clearly enhances complement- and macrophage-mediated anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive tumor cells. Thus - if selectively targeted to the tumor - siRNA-induced inhibition of complement regulation may serve as an innovative strategy to potentiate the efficacy of antibody-based immunotherapy.",

Alternative splicing is an important source of protein diversity, and is an established but not yet fully understood mechanism for gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. Its regulation is governed by a variety of mechanisms, including variation in the expression levels of splicing factors engaged in spliceosome formation. SRp55 is one of the most ubiquitous splicing factors and one that can be up-regulated by DNA damage in the absence of p53, and we had previously found that depletion of its activity increased resistance to DNA damage in p53-dependant manner. To assess its influence on the splicing patterns of genes involved in apoptosis, we performed splice-specific microarray analysis of cells treated with siRNA specific for this gene. This analysis, backed by RT-PCR verification, identified three genes, KSR1, ZAK and mda7/IL24, which are sensitive to SRp55 depletion. We also analyzed the splice patterns of apoptosis-related genes in p53-deficient U2OS cells following treatment with the genotoxic drug mitomycin C. This analysis revealed that DNA damage resulted in changes in splicing activity that modified the splicing pattern of Fas, a key pro-apoptotic, p53-inducible death receptor. Interestingly, this modification led to an enrichment of the anti-apoptotic soluble Fas isoform, and this secreted isoform was detected in the media surrounding cells subjected to DNA damage. These findings show that modulation of splicing activity in p53-deficient cells during the early response to sub-lethal DNA damage results in a change in the splicing of target genes, thus modifying the cellular response to genotoxic agents.",

Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we found a number of potential ABCE1-interacting proteins that might support its function as an endogenous suppressor of RNA interference.

Overexpression of sirtuins (NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Studies of the effects of genes on ageing are vulnerable to confounding effects of genetic background. Here we re-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both C. elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. Instead, longevity co-segregated with a second-site mutation affecting sensory neurons. Outcrossing of a line with low-copy-number sir-2.1 overexpression also abrogated longevity. A Drosophila strain with ubiquitous overexpression of dSir2 using the UAS-GAL4 system was long-lived relative to wild-type controls, as previously reported, but was not long-lived relative to the appropriate transgenic controls, and nor was a new line with stronger overexpression of dSir2. These findings underscore the importance of controlling for genetic background and for the mutagenic effects of transgene insertions in studies of genetic effects on lifespan. The life-extending effect of dietary restriction on ageing in Drosophila has also been reported to be dSir2 dependent. We found that dietary restriction increased fly lifespan independently of dSir2. Our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila.",

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death among American women. This study investigates the mechanism of fibronectin (FN) in stimulating ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion through up-regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway. Human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-3, A2780/CP70) were cultured and treated with fibronectin (10 \u00b5g/mL). Trans-well plates were used to conduct the migration assay, real-time RT-PCR for FAK mRNA expression, and FAK siRNA for blocking FAK expression. Western blots were used for P-FAK, P-PI3K, and P-Akt analysis. Fibronectin-treated OVCAR-3, A2780/CP70 cells have increased ability to migrate and invade. It significantly promoted this behavior through the phosphorylation of FAK. The cell displayed significantly increased signaling regulation of the FAK pathway (p-PI3K/P-Akt). Furthermore, siRNA FAK-treated cells had reduced the levels of p-PI3K/P-Akt after induced by fibronectin. Our results indicate that FAK inhibition can suppress ovarian cancer cells migration and invasion through inhibiting downstream signaling (PI3K/AKT), which might be a therapeutic target or biomarker for ovarian cancer.",

Hsmar1, one of the two subfamilies of mariner transposons in humans, is an ancient element that entered the primate genome lineage approximately 50 million years ago. Although Hsmar1 elements are inactive due to mutational damage, one particular copy of the transposase gene has apparently been under selection. This transposase coding region is part of the SETMAR gene, in which a histone methylatransferase SET domain is fused to an Hsmar1 transposase domain. A phylogenetic approach was taken to reconstruct the ancestral Hsmar1 transposase gene, which we named Hsmar1-Ra. The Hsmar1-Ra transposase efficiently mobilizes Hsmar1 transposons by a cut-and-paste mechanism in human cells and zebra fish embryos. Hsmar1-Ra can also mobilize short inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) related to Hsmar1 (MiHsmar1), thereby establishing a functional relationship between an Hsmar1 transposase source and these MITEs. MiHsmar1 excision is 2 orders of magnitude more efficient than that of long elements, thus providing an explanation for their high copy numbers. We show that the SETMAR protein binds and introduces single-strand nicks into Hsmar1 inverted-repeat sequences in vitro. Pathway choices for DNA break repair were found to be characteristically different in response to transposon cleavage mediated by Hsmar1-Ra and SETMAR in vivo. Whereas nonhomologous end joining plays a dominant role in repairing excision sites generated by the Hsmar1-Ra transposase, DNA repair following cleavage by SETMAR predominantly follows a homology-dependent pathway. The novel transposon system can be a useful tool for genome manipulations in vertebrates and for investigations into the transpositional dynamics and the contributions of these elements to primate genome evolution.",

PURPOSE: EZH2 is a member of the polycomb group of genes and important in cell cycle regulation. Increased expression of EZH2 has been associated previously with invasive growth and aggressive clinical behavior in prostate and breast cancer, but the relationship with tumor cell proliferation has not been examined in human tumors. The purpose of this study was to validate previous findings in a population-based setting, also including tumors that have not been studied previously. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study of nearly 700 patients, we examined EZH2 expression and its association with tumor cell proliferation and other tumor markers, clinical features, and prognosis in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast. RESULTS: Strong EZH2 expression was associated with increased tumor cell proliferation in all four cancer types. Associations were also found between EZH2 and important clinicopathologic variables. EZH2 expression showed significant prognostic impact in melanoma, prostate, and endometrial carcinoma in univariate survival analyses, and revealed independent prognostic importance in carcinoma of the endometrium and prostate. CONCLUSION Our findings point at EZH2 as a novel and independent prognostic marker in endometrial cancer, and validate previous findings on prostate and breast cancer. Further, EZH2 expression was associated with features of aggressive cutaneous melanoma. The fact that EZH2 might identify increased tumor cell proliferation and aggressive subgroups in several cancers may be of practical interest because the polycomb group proteins have been suggested as candidates for targeted therapy. EZH2 expression should, therefore, be further examined as a possible predictive factor.",

The exact cause of this increase is still debated and there are conflicting reports. Sophisticated molecular studies suggest that environmental chemicals may have effects of thyroid carcinogenesis. The development of powerful molecular biology techniques has enabled targeted next-generation sequencing for detection of mutations in thyroid cancer, and this technique can make a specific diagnosis of thyroid cancer in cytologically indeterminate cases. The initial treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is surgery followed by radioiodine remnant ablation. However, further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of radioactive iodine for DTC patients with lateral neck metastasis. DTC is an indolent tumor and may cause death even decades later. Thus, long-term follow-up is mandatory. Recently, dynamic risk stratification (DRS) has begun to use stimulated thyroglobulin level at 1 year after the initial treatment and restratified the risk in accordance with the response to the initial treatment. This DRS strategy accurately predicts disease free survival and can be widely used in daily clinical settings. For the iodine refractory metastatic disease, redifferentiation therapy and targeted therapy are two promising alternative treatments. Sorafenib is the first approved agent for the treatment of progressive iodine refractory advanced thyroid cancer in Korea and may be very helpful for radioactive-refractory locally advanced or metastatic DTC. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years.",

Gonadal function is critically dependant on regulated secretion of the gonadotropin hormones from anterior pituitary gonadotroph cells. Gonadotropin biosynthesis and release is triggered by the binding of hypothalamic GnRH to GnRH receptor expressed on the gonadotroph cell surface. The repertoire of regulatory molecules involved in this process are still being defined. We used the mouse L beta T2 gonadotroph cell line, which expresses both gonadotropin hormones, as a model to investigate GnRH regulation of gene expression and differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify and isolate hormonally induced changes. This approach identified Fanconi anemia a (Fanca), a gene implicated in DNA damage repair, as a differentially expressed transcript. Mutations in Fanca account for the majority of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessively inherited disease identified by congenital defects, bone marrow failure, infertility, and cancer susceptibility. We confirmed expression and hormonal regulation of Fanca mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR, which showed that GnRH induced a rapid, transient increase in Fanca mRNA. Fanca protein was also acutely upregulated after GnRH treatment of L beta T2 cells. In addition, Fanca gene expression was confined to mature pituitary gonadotrophs and adult mouse pituitary and was not expressed in the immature alpha T3-1 gonadotroph cell line. Thus, this study extends the expression profile of Fanca into a highly specialized endocrine cell and demonstrates hormonal regulation of expression of the Fanca locus. We suggest that this regulatory mechanism may have a crucial role in the GnRH-response mechanism of mature gonadotrophs and perhaps the etiology of FA.",

This is especially the case when the tumor cells are resistant to chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Studies concerning the expression of these receptors in prostate cancer vary in the literature, possibly due to differences in patient inclusion, sample preparations and scoring criteria. In our study, EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression was analyzed in prostate cancer samples from primary tumors and corresponding lymph node metastases from 12 patients. The expression of HER2 and EGFR was scored from immunohistochemical preparations and the HercepTest criteria (0, 1+, 2+ or 3+), while HER3 expression was scored as no, weak or strong staining. There were 5 EGFR-positive (2+ or 3+) primary tumors and 6 EGFR-positive lymph node metastases, and there was EGFR upregulation in one metastasis. Only 4 of the 12 patients had marked HER2 expression (2+ or 3+) in their primary tumors and there was one downregulation and 5 cases of upregulation in the metastases. Thus, a total of 8 out of 12 analyzed metastases were HER2-positive. Of the 12 primary tumors, 9 expressed HER3 while only 2 of the lymph node metastases expressed recognizable HER3 staining, so 7 metastases appeared to have downregulated HER3 expression. In one of the primary tumors there was positive co-expression of EGFR and HER2, while this co-expression was observed in 4 of the metastases. Thus, there were tendencies for upregulation of HER2, increased co-expression of EGFR and HER2 and downregulation of HER3 in the prostate cancer lymph node metastases in comparison to the primary tumors. The results are encouraging for studies involving more patients. Possible strategies for EGFR- and HER2-targeted therapy are briefly discussed in the present study, especially with regard to the expression and co-expression of EGFR and HER2 in metastases.",

However, perturbation of its activity often leads to T cell leukemia. Whether and how its transcriptional activities are regulated during hematopoiesis remains to be addressed. Here, we show that TAL1 is associated with histone demethylase complexes containing lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), RE1 silencing transcription factor corepressor (CoREST), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 in erythroleukemia and T cell leukemia cells. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, our data revealed that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and suggest that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs.",

SLN protein expression in wild-type mice was abundant in soleus and red gastrocnemius (RG), low in extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and absent from white gastrocnemius (WG). SERCA activity rates were increased in soleus and RG, but not in EDL or WG, from Sln-null muscles, compared with wild type. No differences were seen between wild-type and Sln-null EDL muscles in force-frequency curves or maximum rates of force development (+dF/dt). Maximum relaxation rates (-dF/dt) of EDL were higher in Sln-null than wild type across a range of submaximal stimulation frequencies, but not during a twitch or peak tetanic contraction. For soleus, no differences were seen between wild type and Sln-null in peak tetanic force or +dF/dt; however, force-frequency curves showed that peak force during a twitch and 10-Hz contraction was lower in Sln-null. Changes in the soleus force-frequency curve corresponded with faster rates of force relaxation at nearly all stimulation frequencies in Sln-null compared with wild type. Repeated tetanic stimulation of soleus caused increased (-dF/dt) in wild type, but not in Sln-null. No compensatory responses were detected in analysis of other Ca(2+) regulatory proteins using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry or myosin heavy chain expression using immunofluorescence. These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates.",

Cross-linking of the FeS cluster domain to the ribosomal protein S12 substantiates an extreme lever-arm movement of the FeS cluster domain during ribosome recycling.

Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy. Expression of the inhibitory halorhodopsin NpHR in hippocampal principal cells has been recently used as a tool to effectively control chemically and electrically induced epileptiform activity in slice preparations, and to reduce in vivo spiking induced by tetanus toxin injection in the motor cortex.

Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In this report, we examined the mechanism of action of human Ctf4 (hCtf4) in DNA replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings show that the purified hCtf4 exists as a dimer and that the hCtf4 SepB domain likely plays a primary role determining the dimeric structure. hCtf4 binds preferentially to DNA template-primer structures, interacts directly with the replicative DNA polymerases (alpha, delta, and epsilon), and markedly stimulates the polymerase activities of DNA polymerases alpha and epsilon in vitro. Depletion of hCtf4 in HeLa cells by small interfering RNA resulted in G(1)/S phase arrest. DNA fiber analysis revealed that cells depleted of hCtf4 exhibited a rate of DNA replication slower than cells treated with control small interfering RNA. These findings suggest that in human cells, hCtf4 plays an essential role in DNA replication and its ability to stimulate the replicative DNA polymerases may contribute to this effect.",

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between SB and GERD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five individuals were eligible to participate in this observational transversal study at the Gastroenterology Service of the Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The participants were classified into 2 groups, those with and without GERD, according to the Montreal Criteria and pH-metry/endoscopy findings. The diagnosis of SB was not assessed in a sleep laboratory but was based on self-report plus clinical inspection, according to the minimal diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The Lipp Stress Symptom Inventory was used to evaluate self-perceived stress. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with SB as dependent variable and GERD, sex, age, body mass index, and stress as predictors (\u03b1=.05; 90% power). RESULTS: The study population included individuals with SB without GERD (13.3%) and individuals with SB with GERD (31.1%). In participants with GERD, the prevalence of SB was 73.7%. Only the variable GERD was significantly associated with SB (P=.017; odds ratio 6.58; 95% confidence interval 1.40-30.98), although adjusted for stress and age. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB.",

The development of the mammary gland requires an integrated response to specific growth factors and steroid hormones.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands have also been implicated in mammary gland growth and morphogenesis. Since both cytokines seem to exert a morphogenic program in this tissue, we have investigated the possible concerted action of EGF and HGF on the HC11 cell line, a widely used model of nontumorigenic mammary cells. Western blot analysis indicated that HC11 expressed MET and EGFR, and showed ERK1/2 and AKT activation following HGF or EGF treatment. Analysis by real-time PCR and western blot showed that after an EGF but not HGF or insulin-like growth factor-I treatment, HC11 mammary cells exhibited an increase in MET expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, which was dependent on the AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment with HGF and EGF increased proliferation, scatter, and invasion as assessed by cell count, cell cycle, scatter, and transwell assays. AKT inhibition did not influence the cooperation on proliferation or invasion after HGF+EGF treatment, while ERK1/2 inhibition abolished MET/EGFR cooperation on proliferation. HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland.",

BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone can have positive effects on the cardiovascular system but its therapeutic potential is limited secondary to its adverse effects. DITPA (3,5-diiodothyroproprionic acid) is a synthetic thyroid hormone analog with positive inotropic effects similar to thyroid hormone but with minimal systemic effects. DITPA has previously been shown to reduce pathologic remodeling and improve cardiac output following myocardial infarction; however, few studies have examined the role of DITPA in determining infarct size or the early inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia. We examined the role of DITPA in the acute phase following infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were subjected to surgical induction of myocardial infarction and were then randomized to receive daily injections of DITPA or vehicle control. After 3 d, animals were sacrificed and infarct size was determined by H and E staining. Myocardial macrophage and neutrophil accumulation was determined by immunofluorescent staining. Immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to examine the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homogenates from the ischemic tissue. RESULTS: Compared with vehicle control, DITPA treated animals had smaller infarcts (52.1%\u00b15.7% versus 37.3%\u00b13.6%, P<0.05) and decreased macrophage (32\u00b14 versus 14\u00b11 cells/HPF, P<0.05, and neutrophil (14\u00b12 versus 7\u00b11 cells/HPF, P<0.05) accumulation. Myocardial ICAM-1, (2.37\u00b10.4 versus 1.1\u00b10.2, P<0.05), KC levels (33.32\u00b112.4 pg/mg, versus 21.24\u00b18.9 pg/mg, P<0.05), and IL-6 levels (112.3\u00b178 pg/mg versus 37.3\u00b125.9 pg/mg, P<0.05) were also reduced in the DITPA treated group, while MCP-1 levels were equivalent between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. The reduction in myocardial ICAM-1, KC, and IL-6 levels in the DITPA group was associated with a decrease in macrophage and neutrophil accumulation.",

Pompe disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in acid \u03b1-glucosidase (GAA) activity due to mutations in the GAA gene. Pompe disease is characterized by accumulation of lysosomal glycogen primarily in heart and skeletal muscles, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. We have shown previously that the small molecule pharmacological chaperone AT2220 (1-deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride, duvoglustat hydrochloride) binds and stabilizes wild-type as well as multiple mutant forms of GAA, and can lead to higher cellular levels of GAA. In this study, we examined the effect of AT2220 on mutant GAA, in vitro and in vivo, with a primary focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained P545L mutant form of human GAA (P545L GAA). AT2220 increased the specific activity of P545L GAA toward both natural (glycogen) and artificial substrates in vitro. Incubation with AT2220 also increased the ER export, lysosomal delivery, proteolytic processing, and stability of P545L GAA. In a new transgenic mouse model of Pompe disease that expresses human P545L on a Gaa knockout background (Tg/KO) and is characterized by reduced GAA activity and elevated glycogen levels in disease-relevant tissues, daily oral administration of AT2220 for 4 weeks resulted in significant and dose-dependent increases in mature lysosomal GAA isoforms and GAA activity in heart and skeletal muscles. Importantly, oral administration of AT2220 also resulted in significant glycogen reduction in disease-relevant tissues. Compared to daily administration, less-frequent AT2220 administration, including repeated cycles of 4 or 5 days with AT2220 followed by 3 or 2 days without drug, respectively, resulted in even greater glycogen reductions. Collectively, these data indicate that AT2220 increases the specific activity, trafficking, and lysosomal stability of P545L GAA, leads to increased levels of mature GAA in lysosomes, and promotes glycogen reduction in situ. As such, AT2220 may warrant further evaluation as a treatment for Pompe disease.",

DNA repair has an essential role in protecting the genome from damage by endogenous and environmental agents.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombination repair (RR) and base excision repair (BER) pathways have critical roles in protection against other cancers, and we wished to investigate their role in colorectal cancer. We have compared the frequency of polymorphisms in the NER genes, XPD, XPF, XPG, ERCC1; in the BER gene, XRCC1; and in the RR gene, XRCC3; in colorectal cancer patients and in a control group. No significant associations were found for any of the NER gene polymorphisms or for the XRCC1 polymorphism. The C allele (position 18067) of the XRCC3 gene was weakly but significantly associated with colorectal cancer (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.22, P=0.03). For all patients who were heterozygous for any of the repair genes studied, tumour tissue was investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

This study would focus on how PHA-E tightly bind to EGFR and the results would compare with EGF. The adhesion force, measured by AFM, between EGFR and PHA-E was 207.14\u00b174.42 pN that was higher than EGF (183.65\u00b186.93 pN).

The result showed that binding affinity of PHA-E to EGFR was one order higher than EGF to EGFR. In the results of flow cytometer and confocal microscope, we found binding efficiency of EGF to EGFR was decrease as the concentration of PHA-E increased. In the analysis of Western blot, treatment of A-549 cells with PHA-E resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in EGFR phosphorylation. In conclusion, we found that PHA-E had better adhesion force and binding affinity to EGFR than that of the EGF.

PURPOSE: We examined if supervised analysis of gene expression data from phase II studies could identify HER-2 overexpression as a predictor of response to trastuzumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression data from 132 newly diagnosed breast cancers were used to simulate 50,000 single-agent phase II trastuzumab studies. True HER-2 amplification was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Only 3.67% of the simulated studies yielded HER-2 as the top predictor, >96% of the individual \"studies\" picked a different gene as the most predictive of trastuzumab response. HER-2 was included in the top 10 gene list 9.73% of the time. When HER-2 was a priori defined as a potential predictor, 99.6% of the simulated studies confirmed overexpression among responders. Candidate marker testing may be more efficient than de novo predictor discovery in phase II trials. We describe a tandem, two-step phase II trial design for rapid marker assessment that combines two optimal two-stage phase II trials into a single study. In the first stage, unselected patients are treated, and if insufficient responses are seen, the trial remains open for marker-positive patients only and a second two-stage trial commences. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of successful discovery of drug-specific pharmacogenomic response markers in a typical phase II study is small. The evaluation of predefined predictors using tandem two-step phase II design has the advantages of estimating response rates in both unselected and marker-selected patient populations and allows for simultaneous screening of multiple different predictors for the same drug and several distinct predictor-drug pairs in a single, parallel multiarm trial.",

MS is a chronic and disabling immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects mainly young adults. MS imposes a huge economic burden on healthcare systems and the society. Although the last 20 years have brought a continuous expansion in therapeutic options, there are still unmet needs in MS management. Available MS drugs have varying degrees of efficacy in reducing relapse risk. The long-term term effects of these treatments are incompletely known. New therapies, along with variations of currently available treatments, may prove more effective and tolerable than the available drugs. Treatments for MS differ with respect to the mode of administration, tolerability and likelihood of treatment adherence, side effects, and risk of major toxicity. The armamentarium of approved disease-modifying therapies in MS and those in development include: (1) the first approved, moderately effective, injectable interferon-\u03b2 and glatiramer acetate; (2) oral drugs (fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate); (3) monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab, alemtuzumab); and (4) immunosuppressive agents (e.g. mitoxantrone).

Therapeutics that impact remyelination in the CNS could be critical determinants of long-term functional outcome in multiple sclerosis (MS). Fingolimod is a S1P receptor modulator in MS clinical trials due to systemic anti-inflammatory properties, yet may impact cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier. Previous studies using isolated dissociated cultures indicate that neural cells express S1P receptors and respond to receptor engagement. Our objective was to assess the effects of fingolimod on myelin-related processes within a multicellular environment that maintains physiological cell-cell interactions, using organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Fingolimod treatment had no impact on myelin under basal conditions. Fingolimod treatment subsequent to lysolecithin-induced demyelination enhanced remyelination and process extension by OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes, while increasing microglia numbers and immunoreactivity for the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. The number of phagocytosing microglia was not increased by fingolimod. Using S1P receptor specific agonists and antagonists, we determined that fingolimod-induced effects on remyelination and astrogliosis were mediated primarily through S1P3 and S1P5, whereas enhanced microgliosis was mediated through S1P1 and S1P5. Taken together, these data demonstrate that fingolimod modulates multiple neuroglial cell responses, resulting in enhanced remyelination in organotypic slice cultures that maintain the complex cellular interactions of the mammalian brain.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Miller Fisher syndrome is a localized variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, characterized by ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis is a related syndrome in which upper motor neurone features accompany the classic triad. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are uniquely found in both conditions and are believed to be pathogenic. RECENT FINDINGS: Infectious illnesses usually precede Miller Fisher syndrome. The clearest associations have been described with Haemophilus influenzae and Campylobacter jejuni infection. Raised cerebrospinal fluid protein is seen in 60% of patients, but clinical features and anti-GQ1b antibody testing are diagnostically more informative. Experimental studies demonstrating complement-dependent neuromuscular block may be relevant to the clinical pathophysiology of Miller Fisher syndrome. Recent neurophysiological studies suggest abnormal neuromuscular transmission occurs in some cases of Miller Fisher syndrome and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Recent mouse models have demonstrated that presynaptic neuronal membranes and perisynaptic Schwann cells are targets for anti-GQ1b antibody attack. The elimination of antiganglioside antibodies from the circulation through specific immunoadsorption therapy has the potential to ameliorate the course of Miller Fisher syndrome. This condition is typically a benign, self-limiting illness. Both plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin may be employed as treatment, especially in cases of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis or those with overlapping Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. SUMMARY: Anti-GQ1b antibody testing has allowed clinicians to develop a greater understanding of the spectrum of Miller Fisher syndromes and to refine clinical diagnoses in patients with unusual presentations. Experimental studies strongly suggest anti-GQ1b antibodies are pathogenic, which in principle should direct treatments towards antibody neutralization or elimination.",

Cylindromatosis (CYLD) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is altered in patients with familial cylindromatosis, a condition characterized by numerous benign adnexal tumors. However, the regulatory function of CYLD remains unsettled. Here we show that the development of B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells was unaffected in CYLD-deficient mice, but that the activation of these cells with mediators of innate and adaptive immunity resulted in enhanced NF-kappaB and JNK activity associated with increased TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) ubiquitination. CYLD-deficient mice were more susceptible to induced colonic inflammation and showed a dramatic increase in the incidence of tumors compared with controls in a colitis-associated cancer model.

Achondroplasia, the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism in humans, occurs between 1 in 15,000 and 40,000 live births. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and there is, on average, an increased paternal age at the time of conception of affected individuals. More then 97% of persons with achondroplasia have a Gly380Arg mutation in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene. Mutations in the FGFR3 gene also result in hypochondroplasia, the lethal thanatophoric dysplasias, the recently described SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans) dysplasia, and two craniosynostosis disorders: Muenke coronal craniosynostosis and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans. Recent evidence suggests that the phenotypic differences may be due to specific alleles with varying degrees of ligand-independent activation, allowing the receptor to be constitutively active. Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis. These specific genotype-phenotype correlations in the FGFR disorders seem to be unprecedented in the study of human disease.

Similarly, the biochemical parameters such as proline content, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed and found to be notably lesser in IG 3 inoculated oat plants in contrast to un-inoculated plants under salt stress. Inoculation of IG 3 strain to oat seedlings under salt stress positively modulated the expression profile of rbcL and WRKY1 genes. Root colonization of root surface and interior was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Due these outcomes, it could be implicated that inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 enhanced plant growth under salt stress condition.

OBJECTIVE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which binds the low-density lipoprotein receptor and targets it for degradation, has emerged as an important regulator of serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease risk. Although much work is currently focused on developing therapies for inhibiting PCSK9, the endogenous regulation of PCSK9, particularly by insulin, remains unclear. The objective of these studies was to determine the effects of insulin on PCSK9 in vitro and in vivo. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using rat hepatoma cells and primary rat hepatocytes, we found that insulin increased PCSK9 expression and increased low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation in a PCSK9-dependent manner. In parallel, hepatic Pcsk9 mRNA and plasma PCSK9 protein levels were reduced by 55% to 75% in mice with liver-specific knockout of the insulin receptor; 75% to 88% in mice made insulin-deficient with streptozotocin; and 65% in ob/ob mice treated with antisense oligonucleotides against the insulin receptor. However, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of insulin receptor in lean, wild-type mice had little effect. In addition, we found that fasting was able to reduce PCSK9 expression by 80% even in mice that lack hepatic insulin signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that although insulin induces PCSK9 expression, it is not the sole or even dominant regulator of PCSK9 under all conditions.",

We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like protein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process.",

The disease is most common in people of Caribbean or Asian descent. SLE mainly affects adults and is common in women between the ages of 20 and 40 years, with a female to male ratio of 9:1. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and encompasses multiple immunological, vascular and inflammatory processes. Diagnosing SLE can be challenging because of the myriad of clinical features and substantial variability between patients. Cutaneous involvement is present in about 60% of cases and typically manifests as a malar or butterfly rash. Joint involvement is inflammatory in nature with arthralgia, arthritis and/or tendinitis and occurs in about 90% of patients with SLE. Cardiorespiratory symptoms are common with chest pain on inspiration due to lupus-induced pleurisy or pericarditis, which may be associated with effusions. Lupus glomerulonephritis is one of the most important systemic complications, occurring in about 30% of patients with SLE in the UK. Careful screening tests for renal disease need to be undertaken as it is asymptomatic. The diagnosis of SLE is traditionally based on a combination of clinical features and laboratory findings and any patient with suspected clinical features of lupus should be investigated for the presence of autoantibodies. Treatment often includes corticosteroids, by various routes, at different points in disease management. In addition, some experts advocate the use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial, as a principal drug in all SLE patients.

INTRODUCTION: Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity which has shown efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in six of ten short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (completed end 2012). METHODS: We performed meta-regression analyses to indirectly compare vortioxetine to seven marketed antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. To ensure study comparability, only experimental drug and placebo arms from placebo-controlled registration studies were included in primary analyses. The main outcomes were efficacy (standardized mean difference in change from baseline to 2 months on primary endpoint [MADRS/HAM-D]), and tolerability (withdrawal rate due to adverse events). RESULTS: For efficacy, estimates of treatment effect (negative estimates favor vortioxetine) for vortioxetine versus comparators were: agomelatine, -0.16 (p = 0.11); desvenlafaxine, 0.03 (p = 0.80); duloxetine, 0.09 (p = 0.42); escitalopram, -0.05 (p = 0.70); sertraline, -0.04 (p = 0.83); venlafaxine IR/XR, 0.12 (p = 0.33); and vilazodone, -0.25 (p = 0.11). For tolerability, all but one combination was numerically in favor of vortioxetine (odds ratio < 1), although not all differences were statistically significant: agomelatine, 1.77 (p = 0.03); desvenlafaxine, 0.58 (p = 0.04); duloxetine, 0.75 (p = 0.26); escitalopram, 0.67 (p = 0.28); sertraline, 0.30 (p = 0.01); venlafaxine, 0.47 (p = 0.01); and vilazodone, 0.64 (p = 0.18). Sensitivity analyses did not significantly alter antidepressant effect estimates or relative ranking. CONCLUSION: These meta-regression data show that vortioxetine offers a comparable or favorable combination of efficacy (measured by MADRS/HAM-D) and tolerability (measured by withdrawal rate due to adverse events) versus other antidepressants in registration studies in MDD. Alternative methods like mixed-treatment comparison and inclusion of all randomized studies and active reference arms may provide complementary information to this analysis (more evidence but also more heterogeneity). Key messages: Indirect comparisons based on registration studies allow a useful comparison between a recently approved antidepressant and an approved drug.

Embolization by macrospheres injected into the left carotid artery of anesthetized rats reduced CBF(LSF) in the territories of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (8/14 animals), the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (2/14) or in less clearly defined regions (4/14). Analysis of MCA occlusions (MCAOs) revealed a first CSD wave starting off during ischemic decline at the emerging core region, propagating concentrically over large portions of left cortex. Subsequent recurrent waves of CSD did not propagate concentrically but preferentially circled around the ischemic core. In the vicinity of the core region, CSDs were coupled to waves of predominantly vasoconstrictive CBF(LSF) responses, resulting in further decline of CBF in the entire inner penumbra and in expansion of the ischemic core. We conclude that CSDs and corresponding CBF responses follow a defined spatiotemporal order, and contribute to early evolution of ischemic territories.",

UNLABELLED: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a unique central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disease with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, which are time- and disease progression-related. It usually affects young adults, with a female predominance of 3:1. Men are more likely to develop symptoms at a slightly older age with a more progressive disease course. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory investigations, with a central role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although the exact etiology is still obscure, the leading hypothesis behind MS relapses is acute inflammatory attacks on CNS myelin and axons. This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to be major contributors to the disease's evolution. MS therapies consist of long-term (immunomodulatory) management, focusing on disease modification, and short-term symptomatic control. Symptomatic treatment includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to protect function and restore quality of life (QoL). The introduction and development of disease-modifying medications provide opportunities to change the face of this disease, enhancing QoL over the long-term. Interferon (INF) and Glatiramer acetate (GLAT) represent first line medications with limited effect and relatively fair safety profile. Newer medications with improved efficacy along with a more hazardous side effect profile are now considered second line therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with poor outcome. The safety and feasibility of continuous high-dose intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and ischemic cerebral injury has not been well studied. METHODS: Patients presenting to our center within 72 hours of aneurysmalSAH (confirmed by computed tomography [CT] scanning and cerebral angiography) between June 2001 and October 2002 were enrolled in a prospective pilot study in which they received MgSO4 as an adjunct to standard SAH management. Study patients received an intravenous infusion of 12 g of MgSO4 in a 500-mL solution of 0.9% NaCl administered at a rate of 4.06 mM (or 0.5 g) every hour over a 24-hour period for 10 days to achieve a target predetermined serum Mg range of more than 1.5 to less than 4.0 mM/L. The effect of MgSO4 on clinical examination, heart rate, and blood pressure was measured every 2 hours; serum glucose and phenytoin levels were monitored daily. Outcome measures included evidence of vasospasm on clinical examination, transcranial Doppler study ((TCD); velocity >or=100 cm/s), or repeat cerebral angiogram obtained within 10 days of SAH; and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score assessment and CT scan evidence of ischemic infarction at 30 days. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (mean age: 55 years; range: 39-84 years; 11 males, 8 females) were enrolled in the study. Presenting Hunt Hess grade was II or higher; mean Fisher grade was 3. Vasospasm was observed in nine patients (by clinical examination in two, TCD in five, and angiogram in nine). The mean serum Mg level was 2.7 mM/L (standard deviation: +/- 0.37) and was maintained during the infusion period. No clinical adverse effects, hemodynamic changes, or fluctuations in serum glucose or phenytoin levels were observed. None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients).

The perceptive hearing loss is considered to be present at birth although it is frequently not recognized for several years. The cause of the hearing defect is a congenital bilateral malformation of the cochlea of the Mondini type. The goitre is not recognized clinically at birth or in early childhood. It becomes apparent in the pre-pubertal years when it presents as a colloid enlargement progressing to a nodular goitre. The thyroid defect has been shown to be a partial defect in iodine organification leading to the underproduction of thyroxine and subsequent thyroid hyperplasia. The syndrome is caused by a single mutant recessive gene responsible for both the deafness and goitre. Its autosomal mechanism gives an equal incidence in both sexes, unusual in thyroid disease. This article reviews the current aspects of pathogenesis and treatment of this syndrome and reports its occurrence in two Sudanese siblings.",

OBJECT: Vasospasm is the major cause of disability and death after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Although the results of 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH, retrospective studies have failed to confirm this. The authors conducted a prospective observational study to determine whether a standardized regimen of simvastatin would reduce the incidence of cerebral vasospasm and improve neurological outcomes in patients with aSAH. METHODS: Since 1991, all patients with aSAH admitted to the authors' institution have been prospectively followed up with standardized outcomes recording. Starting in September 2005, all patients admitted with aSAH were given enteral simvastatin (80 mg/day for 14 days) in addition to the standard care. The incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, length of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality rate, and discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale scores in these 170 patients were compared to data obtained in 170 consecutive patients who underwent treatment in our unit prior to the introduction of statin therapy. RESULTS: The 5-year study period included 340 consecutively treated patients (170 who received statins and 170 who did not). Patients who received simvastatin therapy were more frequently male (29 vs 20%) and had a smaller median aneurysm diameter (6 vs 7 mm). Baseline characteristics were otherwise similar between the cohorts. There were no differences in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (25.3 vs 30.5%; p = 0.277), in-hospital mortality rate (18 vs 15%; p = 0.468), length of hospitalization (21 +/- 15 vs 19 +/- 12 days; p = 0.281), or poor outcome at discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale Scores 1-2: 21.7 vs 18.2%; p = 0.416) between the simvastatin and nonstatin cohorts. There were no statin-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The uniform introduction of simvastatin did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, death, or poor outcome in patients with aSAH. Simvastatin was well tolerated, but its benefit may be less than has been previously reported.",

All cases referred for fetal sex determination from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2009 were ascertained from two laboratories offering the test. Fetal gender determined by NIPD was compared with that based on ultrasound, invasive test or phenotype at birth. Indication and rate of invasive testing was ascertained. In the first year, results were issued in 150/161 pregnancies tested. Of the 135 with outcome data, results were concordant in 130/135 [96.3% (95% CI 91.6-98.8%)]. Reporting criteria were changed and in the subsequent 511 pregnancies the concordancy rate increased to 401/403 [99.5% (95% CI 98.2-99.9%)]. Over the 3 years only 32.9% (174/528) underwent invasive testing.

Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). We use solution NMR to map the structural changes occurring within SLN upon interaction with the regulatory target, SERCA, co-reconstituting the two proteins in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) detergent micelles, a system that preserves the native structure of SLN and the activity of SERCA, with the goal of comparing these interactions with those of the previously studied PLN-SERCA complex. Our analysis of the structural dynamics of SLN in DPC micelles shows this polypeptide to be partitioned into four subdomains: a short unstructured N terminus (residues 1-6), a short dynamic helix (residues 7-14), a more rigid helix (residues 15-26), and an unstructured C terminus (residues 27-31). Upon addition of SERCA, the different domains behave according to their dynamics, molding onto the surface of the enzyme. Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms.",

PURPOSE: We report on three cases with hemiplegia after cervical paraspinal muscle needling and propose possible explanations for these unusual complications. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical charts from a decade (2002-2013) at Korea University Hospital. The records were systematically searched, and the cases with hemiplegia (grade<3) after needing therapy were collected. No conflict of interest reported. No funding received. RESULTS: A 54-year-old woman, a 38-year-old woman, and a 60-year-old man with hemiplegia by cervical subdural or epidural hematoma after cervical posterior paraspinal muscle needling without direct invasion (intramuscular stimulation, acupuncture, or intramuscular lidocaine) were observed. All patients were taken for emergent decompressive laminectomy, and their postoperative motor function improved substantially. CONCLUSION: Spinal hematoma after muscle needling is unusual but was thought to result after a rupture of the epidural or subarachnoid veins by a sharp increase in blood pressure delivered in the intraabdominal or intrathoracic areas after needling therapy.",

BACKGROUND: Mutations in calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) encoding gene have been recently linked to ALS. Similar to several proteins implicated in ALS, CREST contains a prion-like domain and was reported to be a component of paraspeckles. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CREST is prone to aggregation and co-aggregates with FUS but not with other two ALS-linked proteins, TDP-43 and TAF15, in cultured cells. Aggregation of CREST affects paraspeckle integrity, probably by trapping other paraspeckle proteins within aggregates. Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Neither of the CREST mutations described in ALS alters its subcellular localization, stress granule recruitment or detergent solubility; however Q388stop mutation results in elevated steady-state levels and more frequent nuclear aggregation of the protein. Both wild-type protein and its mutants negatively affect neurite network complexity of unstimulated cultured neurons when overexpressed, with Q388stop mutation being the most deleterious. When overexpressed in the fly eye, wild-type CREST or its mutants lead to severe retinal degeneration without obvious differences between the variants. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. A change in CREST levels in neurons which might occur under pathological conditions would have a profound negative effect on neuronal homeostasis.",

It is the leading cause of liver disease in the U.S. and is responsible for most liver transplants. Current treatments for this infectious disease are inadequate; therefore, new therapies must be developed. Several labs have obtained evidence for a protein complex that involves many of the nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the virus. NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins. A fluorescently labeled form of NS3 was used to investigate this interaction through fluorescence polarization binding assays. Results from this assay support interactions that include a 1:1 complex formed between NS3 and NS5B. The modulation of NS3 by NS5B suggests that these proteins may function together during replication of the HCV genome.",

Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) is a highly conserved chaperone of histones H3/H4 that assembles or disassembles chromatin during transcription, replication, and repair. We have found that budding yeast lacking Asf1 has greatly reduced levels of histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9. Lysine 9 is acetylated on newly synthesized budding yeast histone H3 prior to its assembly onto newly replicated DNA. Accordingly, we found that the vast majority of H3 Lys-9 acetylation peaked in S-phase, and this S-phase peak of H3 lysine 9 acetylation was absent in yeast lacking Asf1. By contrast, deletion of ASF1 has no effect on the S-phase specific peak of H4 lysine 12 acetylation; another modification carried by newly synthesized histones prior to chromatin assembly. We show that Gcn5 is the histone acetyltransferase responsible for the S-phase-specific peak of H3 lysine 9 acetylation. Strikingly, overexpression of Asf1 leads to greatly increased levels of H3 on acetylation on lysine 56 and Gcn5-dependent acetylation on lysine 9. Analysis of a panel of Asf1 mutations that modulate the ability of Asf1 to bind to histones H3/H4 demonstrates that the histone binding activity of Asf1 is required for the acetylation of Lys-9 and Lys-56 on newly synthesized H3. These results demonstrate that Asf1 does not affect the stability of the newly synthesized histones per se, but instead histone binding by Asf1 promotes the efficient acetylation of specific residues of newly synthesized histone H3.",

Activation of RelA requires all three IKK subunits, but is independent of NIK. Finally, we show that TNF increases p100 levels, resulting in the specific inhibition of RelB DNA binding via the C-terminus of p100.

Since large animal transgenesis has been successfully attempted for the first time about 25 years ago, the technology has been applied in various lines of transgenic pigs. Nevertheless one of the concerns with the technology--animal welfare--has not been approached through systematic assessment and statements regarding the welfare of transgenic pigs have been based on anecdotal observations during early stages of transgenic programs. The main aim of the present study was therefore to perform an extensive welfare assessment comparing heterozygous transgenic animals expressing GFP with wildtype animals along various stages of post natal development. The protocol used covered reproductory performance and behaviour in GFP and wildtype sows and general health and development, social behaviour, exploratory behaviour and emotionality in GFP and wildtype littermates from birth until an age of roughly 4 months. The absence of significant differences between GFP and wildtype animals in the parameters observed suggests that the transgenic animals in question are unlikely to suffer from deleterious effects of transgene expression on their welfare and thus support existing anecdotal observations of pigs expressing GFP as healthy. Although the results are not surprising in the light of previous experience, they give a more solid fundament to the evaluation of GFP expression as being relatively non-invasive in pigs.

Respiratory involvement and relapses are unusual. Patients with MFS usually have a good recovery and no residual deficits. We describe the clinical features, associated infections and evolution in eight patients with MFS. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Eight cases of MFS and sixty-one of GBS were studied between 1994 and 2003. All cases showed the clinical triad of MFS without major limb weakness or other signs suggestive of CNS involvement. RESULTS: The proportion of MFS with respect to GBS during the same period was 13.1%. Four had a positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus, Salmonella enteritidis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Our cases showed facial palsy (75%), dysphagia (75%), pupillary abnormalities (37.5%) and ventilation support (37.5%). Antiganglioside antibodies, determined in three cases (4 episodes), were positive [GQ1b (50%) and GD1b (50%)]. In all cases, there was a markedly reduced amplitude of the distal sensory as well as frequent axonal degeneration signs. The oldest three patients relapsed and required ventilation support. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time an association between S. enteritidis and C. pneumoniae and MFS. Older patients in our series suffered a faster disease progression with need of ventilation support. We conclude that an older age correlates with poor prognosis and relapses.",

The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis. Since isotretinoin topical treatment usually shows much lower incidence and intensity of adverse effects than tretinoin topical treatment, histological studies are needed to scientifically evaluate the effects of isotretinoin application on epidermis and also to assess if it can be used in anti-aging products as an alternative to tretinoin. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of topical use of tretinoin or isotretinoin on hairless mice epidermis, using appropriate histopathological and histometric techniques, in order to evaluate the influence of isomerism on skin effects. For this, gel cream formulations containing or not 0.05% tretinoin or 0.05% isotretinoin were applied in the dorsum of hairless mice, once a day for seven days. Histopathological evaluation, viable epidermal and horny layer thicknesses as well as the number of epidermal cell layers were determined. Our results showed that tretinoin and isotretinoin were effective in the enhancement of viable epidermis thickness and number of epidermal cell layers, suggesting that they could be used for stimulation of cellular renewal. However isomerism influenced skin effects since isotretinoin had more pronounced effects than tretinoin in viable epidermis.

Exactly 100 years ago, in 1896, Pendred first described the association of congenital deafness with thyroid goitre (MM#274600). The incidence of Pendred syndrome is estimated at 7.5-10/100,000, and may be responsible for as much as 10% of hereditary deafness. The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients. The reason for the association between the thyroid and cochlear defects is similarly obscure, leading some investigators to suggest that the two recessive defects may be occurring together by chance in highly consanguineous families. An in vivo defect in thyroid iodine organification in Pendred syndrome patients has been reported. However, the molecular basis of this defect is unknown and the presence of an intrinsic thyroidal defect has not been conclusively demonstrated. We have adopted a genetic linkage study as a first step towards identifying the gene. The availability of an inbred Pendred syndrome kindred allowed us to utilize an efficient DNA pooling strategy to perform a genome-wide linkage search for the disease locus. In this way, we have mapped the disease locus to an approximately 9-cM interval between GATA23F5 and D7S687 on chromosome 7. In addition, we demonstrate an intrinsic thyroid iodine organification defect in a patient's thyroid cells as the cause of the thyroid dysfunction.",

BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are essential in host defense against pathogens by virtue of their capacity to detect microbes and initiate the immune response. TLR2 is seen as the most important receptor for gram-positive bacteria, while TLR4 is regarded as the gram-negative TLR. Melioidosis is a severe infection caused by the gram-negative bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, that is endemic in Southeast Asia. We aimed to characterize the expression and function of TLRs in septic melioidosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patient studies: 34 patients with melioidosis demonstrated increased expression of CD14, TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 on the cell surfaces of monocytes and granulocytes, and increased CD14, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, LY96 (also known as MD-2), TLR5, and TLR10 mRNA levels in purified monocytes and granulocytes when compared with healthy controls. In vitro experiments: Whole-blood and alveolar macrophages obtained from TLR2 and TLR4 knockout (KO) mice were less responsive to B. pseudomallei in vitro, whereas in the reverse experiment, transfection of HEK293 cells with either TLR2 or TLR4 rendered these cells responsive to this bacterium. In addition, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of B. pseudomallei signals through TLR2 and not through TLR4. Mouse studies: Surprisingly, TLR4 KO mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice with respect to bacterial outgrowth and survival in experimentally induced melioidosis. In contrast, TLR2 KO mice displayed a markedly improved host defenses as reflected by a strong survival advantage together with decreased bacterial loads, reduced lung inflammation, and less distant-organ injury. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with melioidosis displayed an up-regulation of multiple TLRs in peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes. Although both TLR2 and TLR4 contribute to cellular responsiveness to B. pseudomallei in vitro, TLR2 detects the LPS of B. pseudomallei, and only TLR2 impacts on the immune response of the intact host in vivo. Inhibition of TLR2 may be a novel treatment strategy in melioidosis.",

Primary factors correlating with fusion rates are the presence of transmembrane helices in HKs and the presence of DNA-binding domains in RRs, features that require correct (and separate) spatial location. In the absence of such features, there is a relative abundance of fused genes. The order of paired HK and RR genes and the nucleotide distance between encoded domains also correlate with apparent gene fusion rates.

Mulibrey nanism is an autosomal recessive growth disorder caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding a protein of unknown function. More than half of female patients with Mulibrey nanism develop benign mesenchymal tumors of ovarian sex cord-stromal origin. In this work, we characterize the gynecological tumors of female patients with Mulibrey nanism in detail. In addition to tumors of the fibrothecoma group, 18% (4/22) of the patients were observed with epithelial neoplasias, including 2 ovarian adenofibromas, 1 ovarian poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma. To investigate the possible involvement of TRIM37 alterations in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas, we analyzed the TRIM37 cDNA for mutations and alternatively spliced transcripts and TRIM37 expression in fibrothecomas of women without Mulibrey nanism. No mutations in the open-reading frame of TRIM37 were detected. Two alternatively spliced variants were found, one lacking exon 23 and one exon 2. TRIM37del2 was also found in normal ovary but in a proportion of sporadic fibrothecomas, the TRIM37del2:TRIM37 ratio was increased. In normal ovary, TRIM37 was localized in the cytoplasm of stromal cells, especially theca cells surrounding developing follicles. TRIM37 transcript was found in all sporadic fibrothecomas examined, but 80% (20/25) of the tumors showed reduced or absent expression of TRIM37 protein. Allelic loss at the TRIM37 locus (17q22-23) was observed in 6% of sporadic fibrothecomas. Nearly half of the sporadic fibrothecomas showed evidence of CpG promoter methylation, suggesting promoter downregulation as one mechanism of reduced TRIM37 expression. In conclusion, inherited biallelic inactivation of TRIM37 (Mulibrey nanism) predisposes to both mesenchymal and epithelial ovarian tumors and dysregulation of TRIM37 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas.",

BACKGROUND: Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.",

Amiodarone, a powerful antiarrhythmic drug, likely exerts its major effect by antagonism of thyroid hormone (T3), probably at the receptor level. T3 is known to regulate beta-adrenergic receptor density in the heart but the effects of sympathomimetic drugs on thyroid hormone receptors (T3R) is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate how amiodarone and isoproterenol affect T3R-mRNA in cultured cardiomyocytes. Confluent, isoproterenol pretreated, AT-1 cardiomyocytes were treated with isoproterenol free medium, amiodarone, T3 and amiodarone together with T3 for 48 hours. Solution hybridization for the determination of mRNA for T3R alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2 were performed. In itself isoproterenol upregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, respectively, downregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, added together, upregulated T3R alpha 2 and T3R beta 1 (p < 0.05) as compared to amiodarone or T3 alone. There was an antagonistic effect between amiodarone and T3 for the regulation T3R beta 1. This is the first evidence showing that amiodarone regulates T3R-mRNA concentrations during cathecholamine stress. Isoproterenol regulation of T3R-mRNA levels provides further evidence for the close interaction between the thyroid hormone and the beta-adrenergic systems.",

Mudpuppy parasympathetic neurons exhibit spontaneous miniature hyperpolarizations (SMHs) that are generated by potassium currents, which are spontaneous miniature outward currents (SMOCs), flowing through clusters of large conductance voltage- and calcium (Ca(2+))-activated potassium (BK) channels. The underlying SMOCs are initiated by a Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) mechanism. Perforated-patch whole cell voltage recordings were used to determine whether activation of SMHs contributed to action potential (AP) repolarization or affected the latency to AP generation. Blockade of BK channels by iberiotoxin (IBX, 100 nM) slowed AP repolarization and increased AP duration. Treatment with omega-conotoxin GVIA (3 microM) or nifedipine (10 microM) to inhibit Ca(2+) influx through N- or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), respectively, also decreased the rate of AP repolarization and increased AP duration. Elimination of CICR by treatment with either thapsigargin (1 microM) or ryanodine (10 microM) produced no significant change in AP repolarization or duration. Blockade of BK channels with IBX and inhibition of N-type VDCCs with omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not inhibition of L-type VDCCs with nifedipine, decreased the latency of AP generation. A decrease in latency to AP generation occurred with elimination of SMHs by inhibition of CICR following treatment with thapsigargin. Ryanodine treatment decreased AP latency in three of six cells. Apamin (100 nM) had no affect on AP repolarization, duration, or latency to AP generation, but did decrease the hyperpolarizing afterpotential (HAP). Inhibition of L-type VDCCs by nifedipine also decreased HAP amplitude. Inhibition of CICR by either thapsigargin or ryanodine treatment increased the number of APs generated with long depolarizing current pulses, whereas exposure to IBX or omega-conotoxin GVIA depressed excitability. We conclude that CICR, the process responsible for SMH generation, represents a unique mechanism to modulate the response to subthreshold depolarizing currents that drive the membrane potential toward the threshold for AP initiation but does not contribute to AP repolarization. Subthreshold depolarizations would not activate sufficient numbers of VDCCs to allow Ca(2+) influx to elevate [Ca(2+)](i) to the extent needed to directly activate nearby BK channels. However, the elevation in [Ca(2+)](i) is sufficient to trigger CICR from ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Thus CICR acts as an amplification mechanism to trigger a local elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) near a cluster of BK channels to activate these channels at negative levels of membrane potential.",

Immunohistochemical analysis predominantly localized TNNI3K in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes. In vitro kinase assay showed that TNNI3K is a functional kinase. The yeast two-hybrid system showed that TNNI3K could directly interact with cardiac troponin I, results that were further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in vivo. Our data suggest that TNNI3K is a cardiac-specific kinase and play important roles in cardiac system.",

In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. To examine whether the piRNA pathway can be used to silence genes of interest in germ cells, we have generated knock-in mice in which a foreign DNA fragment was inserted into a region generating pachytene piRNAs. The knock-in sequence was transcribed, and the resulting RNA was processed to yield piRNAs in postnatal testes. When reporter genes possessing a sequence complementary to portions of the knock-in sequence were introduced, they were greatly repressed after the time of pachytene piRNA generation. This repression mainly occurred at the post-transcriptional level, as degradation of the reporter RNAs was accelerated. Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons.",

Contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias associated with heart failure have been attributed to aberrant sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) cycling. The study of junctin (JCN) and histidine-rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) becomes of particular importance since these proteins have been shown to be critical regulators of Ca(2+) cycling. Specifically, JCN is a SR membrane protein, which is part of the SR Ca(2+) release quaternary structure that also includes the ryanodine receptor, triadin and calsequestrin. Functionally, JCN serves as a bridge between calsequestrin and the Ca(2+) release channel, ryanodine receptor. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function. In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced. This review examines the roles of JCN and HRC in SR Ca(2+) cycling and their potential significance in heart failure.",

PURPOSE: Our objective was to compare open and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with respect to postoperative delirium. METHODS: After Institutional Ethics Review Board approval, we conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent abdominal and thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery at Toronto General Hospital during June 2006 to December 2007. Patients were classed into either the OPEN or the endovascular (EVAR) group based on the type of surgery and were assessed for the presence of delirium after surgery. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the validated chart review instrument were used for diagnosis of delirium. Patients with dementia and/or abnormal levels of consciousness preoperatively were excluded. RESULTS: There were 256 patients included in the study, 149 (58%) in the OPEN group and 107 (42%) in the EVAR group. Patients in the EVAR group were considerably older, 74 (10) yr vs 68 (9) yr, and they had shorter duration of surgery, 150 [119, 180] min vs 200 [165, 260] min, respectively, P < 0.0001. Postoperative delirium was present in 43 (29%) patients in the OPEN group and 14 (13%) patients in the EVAR group (95% confidence interval [CI], 22 to 36 vs 95% CI, 7 to 19, respectively; P = 0.003). Hospital length of stay was 8.3 [6.6, 13.4] days in the OPEN group and 4.5 [3.1, 6.4] days in the EVAR group, P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative management of patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair was associated with lower rates of delirium after surgery than that of patients undergoing open aortic aneurysm repair.",

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb. Here we present cDNA sequences, genetic mapping, and genomic analyses for the four previously undescribed zebrafish FA genes (fanci, fancj, fancm, and fancn), and show that they reverted to single copy after the teleost genome duplication. We tested the hypothesis that FA genes are expressed during embryonic development in tissues that are disrupted in human patients by investigating fanc gene expression patterns. We found fanc gene maternal message, which can provide Fanc proteins to repair DNA damage encountered in rapid cleavage divisions. Zygotic expression was broad but especially strong in eyes, central nervous system and hematopoietic tissues. In the pectoral fin bud at hatching, fanc genes were expressed specifically in the apical ectodermal ridge, a signaling center for fin/limb development that may be relevant to the radius/thumb anomaly of FA patients. Hatching embryos expressed fanc genes strongly in the oral epithelium, a site of squamous cell carcinomas in FA patients. Larval and adult zebrafish expressed fanc genes in proliferative regions of the brain, which may be related to microcephaly in FA. Mature ovaries and testes expressed fanc genes in specific stages of oocyte and spermatocyte development, which may be related to DNA repair during homologous recombination in meiosis and to infertility in human patients. The intestine strongly expressed some fanc genes specifically in proliferative zones. Our results show that zebrafish has a complete complement of fanc genes in single copy and that these genes are expressed in zebrafish embryos and adults in proliferative tissues that are often affected in FA patients. These results support the notion that zebrafish offers an attractive experimental system to help unravel mechanisms relevant not only to FA, but also to breast cancer, given the involvement of fancj (brip1), fancn (palb2) and fancd1 (brca2) in both conditions.",

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a disabling and distressing symptom that is highly prevalent across the cancer continuum from a patient's diagnosis and treatment through survivorship and end of life. It has a multifactorial etiology and significant individual variability in its clinical expression, determinants, and sequelae. Despite the significance of CRF, it is often underdiagnosed, and management is frequently suboptimal. This review synthesizes the state of the science concerning the features, possible mechanisms, and predictors of CRF; offers recommendations for the evaluation of CRF; and appraises the strength of the evidence for a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent and manage fatigue during and after cancer and its treatment. There is evidence from methodologically rigorous controlled trials that exercise, psycho-educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia are effective in the treatment of CRF, and a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions has shown initial promise in single-arm pilot studies with small, heterogeneous samples. Rigorously designed and adequately powered randomized trials are warranted to (1) determine the effectiveness of promising approaches and (2) identify the interventions that are most effective in treating CRF in specific subpopulations (eg, stem cell transplant recipients, older adults, patients with lung or colorectal cancers, survivors, and those at the end of life). Studies to elucidate the biologic expression profiles of CRF, to explicate the mechanisms through which particular interventions impact CRF, and to identify the mediators and moderators of fatigue outcomes will ultimately permit individually tailored approaches for the treatment of CRF.",

BACKGROUND: Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is an inherited, progressively debilitating disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin gene. This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of patisiran (ALN-TTR02), a small interfering RNA encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles, in patients with transthyretin-mediated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). METHODS: In this phase II study, patients with FAP were administered 2 intravenous infusions of patisiran at one of the following doses: 0.01 (n = 4), 0.05 (n = 3), 0.15 (n = 3), or 0.3 (n = 7) mg/kg every 4\u00a0weeks (Q4W), or 0.3\u00a0mg/kg (n = 12) every 3\u00a0weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Of 29 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 26 completed the study. Administration of patisiran led to rapid, dose-dependent, and durable knockdown of transthyretin, with the maximum effect seen with patisiran 0.3\u00a0mg/kg; levels of mutant and wild-type transthyretin were reduced to a similar extent in Val30Met patients. A mean level of knockdown exceeding 85\u00a0% after the second dose, with maximum knockdown of 96\u00a0%, was observed for the Q3W dose. The most common treatment-related adverse event (AE) was mild-to-moderate infusion-related reactions in 10.3\u00a0% of patients. Four serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 1 patient administered 0.3\u00a0mg/kg Q3W (urinary tract infection, sepsis, nausea, vomiting), and 1 patient administered 0.3\u00a0mg/kg Q4W had 1 SAE (extravasation-related cellulitis). CONCLUSIONS: Patisiran was generally well tolerated and resulted in significant dose-dependent knockdown of transthyretin protein in patients with FAP. Patisiran 0.3\u00a0mg/kg Q3W is currently in phase III development. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01617967 .",

IMPORTANCE: Dupilumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with asthma and atopic dermatitis, which are both type 2 helper T-cell-mediated diseases. OBJECTIVE: To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study conducted at 13 sites in the United States and Europe between August 2013 and August 2014 in 60 adults with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis refractory to intranasal corticosteroids with 16 weeks of follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: Subcutaneous dupilumab (a 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg weekly; n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) plus mometasone furoate nasal spray for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in endoscopic nasal polyp score (range, 0-8; higher scores indicate worse status) at 16 weeks (primary end point). Secondary end points included Lund-Mackay computed tomography (CT) score (range, 0-24; higher scores indicate worse status), 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test score (range, 0-110; higher scores indicating worse quality of life; minimal clinically important difference > 8.90), sense of smell assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score (range, 0-40; higher scores indicate better status), symptoms, and safety. RESULTS: Among the 60 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 48.4 years [9.4 years]; 34 men [56.7%]; 35 with comorbid asthma), 51 completed the study. The least squares (LS) mean change in nasal polyp score was -0.3 (95% CI, -1.0 to 0.4) with placebo and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.5 to -1.2) with dupilumab (LS mean difference, -1.6 [95% CI, -2.4 to -0.7]; P < .001). The LS mean difference between the 2 groups for the Lund-Mackay CT total score was -8.8 (95% CI, -11.1 to -6.6; P < .001). Significant improvements with dupilumab were also observed for the 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test (LS mean difference between groups, -18.1 [95% CI, -25.6 to -10.6]; P < .001) and sense of smell assessed by UPSIT (LS mean difference, 14.8 [95% CI, 10.9 to 18.7]; P < .001). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (33% in the placebo group vs 47% in the dupilumab group), injection site reactions (7% vs 40%, respectively), and headache (17% vs 20%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with symptomatic chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis refractory to intranasal corticosteroids, the addition of subcutaneous dupilumab to mometasone furoate nasal spray compared with mometasone alone reduced endoscopic nasal polyp burden after 16 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess longer treatment duration, larger samples, and direct comparison with other medications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01920893.",

Here we use quantitative microscopy to characterize descriptors of focal adhesion and cell motility for mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human fibrosarcoma cells, across a wide range of matrix compliance and following genetic manipulations of focal adhesion proteins (vinculin, talin, zyxin, FAK, and paxilin). This analysis reveals a tight, biphasic gaussian relationship between mean size of focal adhesions (not their number, surface density, or shape) and cell speed.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with multiple probes was used to analyze mitotic and meiotic chromosome spreads of Avena sativa cv 'Sun II' monosomic lines, and of A. byzantina cv 'Kanota' monosomic lines from spontaneous haploids. The probes used were A. strigosa pAs120a (a repetitive sequence abundant in A-genome chromatin), A. murphyi pAm1 (a repetitive sequence abundant in C-genome chromatin), A. strigosa pITS (internal transcribed spacer of rDNA) and the wheat rDNA probes pTa71 (nucleolus organizer region or NOR) and pTa794 (5S). Simultaneous and sequential FISH employing pairs of these probes allowed the identification and genome assignation of all chromosomes. FISH mapping using mitotic and meiotic metaphases facilitated the genomic and chromosomal identification of the monosome in each line. Of the 17 'Sun II' lines analyzed, 13 distinct monosomic lines were found, corresponding to four monosomes of the A-genome, five of the C-genome and four of the D-genome. In addition, 12 distinct monosomic lines were detected among the 20 'Kanota' lines examined, corresponding to six monosomes of the A-genome, three of the C-genome and three of the D-genome. The results show that 19 chromosomes out of 21 of the complement are represented by monosomes between the two genetic backgrounds. The identity of the remaining chromosomes can be deduced either from one intergenomic translocation detected on both 'Sun II' and 'Kanota' lines, or from the single reciprocal, intergenomic translocation detected among the 'Sun II' lines. These results permit a new system to be proposed for numbering the 21 chromosome pairs of the hexaploid oat complement. Accordingly, the A-genome contains chromosomes 8A, 11A, 13A, 15A, 16A, 17A and 19A; the C-genome contains chromosomes 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C and 7C; and the D-genome consists of chromosomes 9D, 10D, 12D, 14D, 18D, 20D and 21D. Moreover, the FISH patterns of 16 chromosomes in 'Sun II' and 15 in 'Kanota' suggest that these chromosomes could be involved in intergenomic translocations.

In particular, migrating cells have been shown to sense substrate stiffness and alter cell morphology and speed. Zyxin is a focal adhesion protein that responds to external mechanical forces; however, the mechanisms of zyxin recruitment at force-bearing sites are unknown. Using force-sensing microfabricated substrates, we simultaneously measured traction force and zyxin recruitment at force-bearing sites. GFP-tagged zyxin accumulates at force-bearing sites at the leading edge, but not at the trailing edge, of migrating epithelial cells. Zyxin recruitment at force-bearing sites depends on Rho-kinase and myosin II activation, suggesting that zyxin responds not only to the externally applied force, as previously shown, but also to the internally generated actin-myosin force. Zyxin in turn recruits vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a regulator of actin assembly, to force-bearing sites. To dissect the domains of zyxin that are essential for this unique force-dependent accumulation, we generated two zyxin truncation mutants: one lacking the LIM domain (\u0394LIM) and one containing only the LIM domain with all three LIM motifs (LIM). GFP-tagged \u0394LIM does not localize to the force-bearing sites, but GFP-tagged zyxin LIM-domain is sufficient for the recruitment to and dynamics at force-bearing focal adhesions. Furthermore, one or two LIM motifs are not sufficient for force-dependent accumulation, suggesting that all three LIM motifs are required.

BACKGROUND: Telomerase activity is found in 85%-90% of all human cancers but not in their adjacent normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component in the telomerase complex that plays an important role in telomerase activity. This study investigated the effect of the telomerase inhibition with an hTERT antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) in bladder cancer cells (T24) on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced apoptosis. METHODS: Antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (AS PS-ODN) was synthesized and purified. Telomerase activity was measured by polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunoassay (PCR-ELISA). hTERT mRNA expression was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and a gel-image system. hTERT protein was detected by immunochemistry and flow cytometry. Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-Diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was observed by a morphological method and determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: AS PS-ODN significantly inhibited telomerase activity and decreased the levels of hTERT mRNA which preceded the decline in the telomerase activity. AS PS-ODN significantly reduced the percentage of positive cells expressing hTERT protein following the decline of hTERT mRNA levels. There was no difference seen in the telomerase activity, hTERT mRNA expression or the protein levels between the sense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (SPS-ODN) and the control group. AS PS-ODN treatment significantly decreased the cell viability and enhanced the apoptotic rate of T24 cells in response to TNF-alpha while there was no difference in cell viability and apoptotic rate between the S PS-ODN and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: AS PS-ODN can significantly inhibit telomerase activity by downregulating the hTERT mRNA and protein expression. Treatment with AS PS-ODN may be a potential and most promising strategy for bladder cancer with telomerase activity.",

A phylogenetic analysis of HrLXR showed that it belongs to the tunicate (urochordate) LXR subgroup, which is distinct from vertebrate LXRs. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that HrLXR mRNA was expressed predominantly in the gills, and highly expressed in unfertilized eggs followed by decrease at later embryonic and larval stages. Unexpectedly, HrLXR was not activated by GW3965, whereas a synthetic ligand for a farnesoid X receptor, GW4064, activated HrLXR. This activation was abolished by the deletion of 51 amino acids from the N-terminus. In a mammalian two-hybrid system, HrLXR interacted with HrRXR in the presence of GW4064 or 9-cis retinoic acid. The injection of GW3965 and GW4064 in vivo increased the ATPbinding cassette sub-family G member 4 and HrLXR mRNA levels in the hepatopancreas and gills.

A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease. The effect of the R-to-W conversion on the phosphatase activity of PTPN22 protein and the impact of the minor T allele of the C1858T SNP on the activation of T cells has remained controversial. In addition, how the overall activity of PTPN22 is regulated and how the R-to-W conversion contributes to rheumatoid arthritis is still poorly understood. Here we report the identification of an alternative splice form of human PTPN22, namely PTPN22.6. It lacks the nearly entire phosphatase domain and can function as a dominant negative isoform of the full length PTPN22. Although conversion of R620 to W620 in the context of PTPN22.1 attenuated T cell activation, expression of the tryptophan variant of PTPN22.6 reciprocally led to hyperactivation of human T cells. More importantly, the level of PTPN22.6 in peripheral blood correlates with disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (DOX) and trastuzumab (TRZ) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents in the breast cancer setting, limited by their cardiotoxic side effects. Among the potential mechanisms for this drug-induced cardiomyopathy, increased production of oxidative stress (OS) through a nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3)-dependent pathway has gained recent attention. The objective of the study was to determine the role of NOS3 and OS in a clinically relevant female murine model of DOX- and TRZ-induced heart failure. METHODS: A total of 120 female mice (60 wild-type [WT] and 60 NOS3 knockout [NOS3(-/-)]) were treated with either 0.9% saline, DOX, TRZ, or DOX with TRZ (DOX+TRZ). Serial echocardiography was performed for a total of 10 days, after which the mice were euthanized for histological and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: In WT female mice receiving DOX+TRZ, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from 75 \u00b1 3% at baseline to 46 \u00b1 2% at day 10 (P < 0.05). In the NOS3(-/-) group, LVEF decreased from 72 \u00b1 3% at baseline to 35 \u00b1 2% at day 10 (P < 0.05). LVEF was significantly lower in NOS3(-/-) female mice receiving DOX+TRZ than WT mice at day 10 (P < 0.05). Compared with WT, NOS3(-/-) female mice also demonstrated increased mortality after treatment with DOX+TRZ, corroborating the echocardiographic findings. Histological analysis demonstrated increased myofibrillar degradation and loss of cell integrity in NOS3(-/-) female mice treated with DOX+TRZ. There was increased generation of oxidized phosphatidylcholine, a marker of OS, in NOS3(-/-) female mice receiving DOX+TRZ compared with control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital absence of NOS3 potentiates the cardiotoxic side effects of DOX+TRZ in an acute female murine model of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.",

AIM: Determine the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of avanafil, a highly specific, rapidly absorbed phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor in male patients with mild to severe erectile dysfunction (ED), with or without diabetes. METHODS: This was a 52-week, open-label extension of two 12-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials. Patients were assigned to avanafil 100 mg, but could request 200 mg (for increased efficacy; '100/200-mg' group) or 50 mg (for improved tolerability). Primary end points included percentage of sexual attempts ending in successful vaginal penetration [Sexual Encounter Profile 2 (SEP2)] and intercourse (SEP3) and erectile function domain score per the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF). RESULTS: Some 712 patients enrolled; 686 were included in the intent to treat population and contributed to the data. All primary end points showed sustained improvement. SEP2 and SEP3 success rates improved from 44% to 83% and from 13% to 68% (100-mg group) and from 43% to 79% and from 11% to 66% (100/200-mg group), respectively.

Sixty-five per cent (112/172) of 'nonresponders' to avanafil 100 mg responded to the 200-mg dose. The most common ( > 2%) treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, flushing, nasopharyngitis and nasal congestion; < 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a complex process involving both genetic and epigenetic factors. The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene regulates the metabolism of key neurotransmitters and has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors. This study investigates whether MAOA promoter methylation is associated with atherosclerosis, and whether this association is confounded by familial factors in a monozygotic (MZ) twin sample. METHODS: We studied 84 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs drawn from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured by ultrasound. DNA methylation in the MAOA promoter region was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing using genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. The association between DNA methylation and IMT was first examined by generalized estimating equation, followed by matched pair analyses to determine whether the association was confounded by familial factors. RESULTS: When twins were analyzed as individuals, increased methylation level was associated with decreased IMT at four of the seven studied CpG sites. However, this association substantially reduced in the matched pair analyses. Further adjustment for MAOA genotype also considerably attenuated this association. CONCLUSIONS: The association between MAOA promoter methylation and carotid IMT is largely explained by familial factors shared by the twins. Because twins reared together share early life experience, which may leave a long-lasting epigenetic mark, aberrant MAOA methylation may represent an early biomarker for unhealthy familial environment. Clarification of familial factors associated with DNA methylation and early atherosclerosis will provide important information to uncover clinical correlates of disease.",

Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding.

BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterised by an absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract. Manifestation of the disease has been linked to mutations in genes that encode the crucial signals for the development of the enteric nervous system-the RET and EDNRB signalling pathways. The Phox2b gene is involved in neurogenesis and regulates Ret expression in mice, in which disruption of the Phox2b results in a HSCR-like phenotype. AIMS: To investigate the contribution of PHOX2B to the HSCR phenotype. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing, we screened PHOX2B coding regions and intron/exon boundaries for mutations and polymorphisms in 91 patients with HSCR and 71 ethnically matched controls. Seventy five HSCR patients with no RET mutations were independently considered. Haplotype and genotype frequencies were compared using the standard case control statistic. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three new polymorphisms: two novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (A-->G(1364); A-->C(2607)) and a 15 base pair deletion (DEL(2609)). Statistically significant differences were found for A-->G(1364). Genotypes comprising allele G were underrepresented in patients (19% v 36%; chi(2)=9.30; p=0.0095 and 22% v 36%; chi(2)=7.38; p=0.024 for patients with no RET mutations). Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed no LD between physically close polymorphisms indicating a hot spot for recombination in exon 3. CONCLUSION: The PHOX2B A-->G(1364) polymorphism is associated with HSCR. Whether it directly contributes to disease susceptibility or represents a marker for a locus in LD with PHOX2B needs further investigation. Our findings are in accordance with the involvement of PHOX2B in the signalling pathways governing the development of enteric neurones.",

Substantial evidence indicates that microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key oncomiR in carcinogenesis and is significantly elevated in multiple myeloma (MM). In this study, we explored the role of miR-21 in human MM cells and searched for miR-21 targets. By knocking down the expression of endogenous miR-21 in U266 myeloma cells, we observed reduced growth, an arrested cell cycle, and increased apoptosis. To further understand its molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of MM, we employed a SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative proteomic strategy to systematically identify potential targets of miR-21. In total, we found that the expression of 178 proteins was up-regulated significantly by miR-21 inhibition, implying that they could be potential targets of miR-21. Among these, the protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) was confirmed as a direct miR-21 target by Western blotting and reporter gene assays. We further demonstrated that miR-21 enhances the STAT3-dependent signal pathway by inhibiting the function of PIAS3 and that down-regulation of PIAS3 contributes to the oncogenic function of miR-21. This elucidation of the role of PIAS3 in the miR-21-STAT3 positive regulatory loop not only may shed light on the molecular basis of the biological effects of miR-21 observed in MM cells but also has direct implications for the development of novel anti-MM therapeutic strategies.",

The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP.

When laparoscopy is performed to evaluate a woman with pelvic pain symptoms, it is important she be counseled that the primary function of the surgery is to confirm the presence (and allow surgical treatment) of endometriosis, and that it is not the penultimate diagnostic modality for her pelvic pain. There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. It is unfortunate that many women are left with the belief that if a laparoscopy fails to provide a diagnosis of a pain generator, then it means there are no diagnoses other than that the \u201cpain is in her head,\u201d often disparagingly termed \u201csupratentorial\u201d byclinicians. In fact, the pain-related diagnoses that are amenable to and possibly require a laparoscopy are quite limited, a group of diagnoses that this author terms the \u201cdirty dozen\u201d because there are just 12, and only the first 4 have good evidence to clearly associate them with chronic pelvic pain:1.

Methamidophos (O,S-dimethyl phosphoroamidothiolate, Tamaron), an organophosphate (OP) anticholinesterase of limited toxicity, is widely used as an insecticide and acaricide. To provide additional insight into the molecular basis of its action, we have used electrophysiological and biochemical techniques to study the effects of methamidophos on the neuromuscular junction of rat and frog and on the central nervous system of rat. Methamidophos has a relatively weak inhibitory action on cholinesterases in rat diaphragm muscle, brain and hippocampal homogenates, with IC50 values on the order of 20-20 microM. An even weaker anticholinesterase activity was found in frog muscle homogenates, with the IC50 being above 300 microM. As further evidence of anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos (1-100 microM) was able to reverse the blockade by d-tubocurarine (0.5-0.7 microM) of neuromuscular transmission in rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations. Inhibition of cholinesterase activity by methamidophos was long lasting, which is consistent with the formation by the agent of a covalent bond with the enzyme's active serine residue. The action was also slowly reversible, which suggests spontaneous reactivation of the enzyme. electrophysiological studies at the rat neuromuscular junction showed that, due to its anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos increased the amplitude and prolonged the decay phase of nerve-evoked and spontaneous miniature end-plate potentials. In contrast to other OP compounds, e.g., paraoxon (Rocha et al., 1996a), methamidophos did not affect neurotransmitter release, nor did it interact directly with the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Moreover, it contrast to paraoxon, methamidophos did not affect the whole-cell currents induced by application of acetylcholine, glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid recorded to cultured hippocampal neurons. Based on these data, methamidophos appears to have a selective effect on cholinesterase.",

The central histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 comprises a highly conserved globular core and a divergent C-terminal tail. While the function and structure of the Asf1 core are well known, the function of the tail is less well understood. Here, we have explored the role of the yeast (yAsf1) and human (hAsf1a and hAsf1b) Asf1 tails in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show, using a photoreactive, unnatural amino acid, that Asf1 tail residue 210 cross-links to histone H3 in vivo and, further, that loss of C-terminal tail residues 211 to 279 weakens yAsf1-histone binding affinity in vitro nearly 200-fold. Via several yAsf1 C-terminal truncations and yeast-human chimeric proteins, we found that truncations at residue 210 increase transcriptional silencing and that the hAsf1a tail partially substitutes for full-length yAsf1 with respect to silencing but that full-length hAsf1b is a better overall substitute for full-length yAsf1. In addition, we show that the C-terminal tail of Asf1 is phosphorylated at T270 in yeast. Loss of this phosphorylation site does not prevent coimmunoprecipitation of yAsf1 and Rad53 from yeast extracts, whereas amino acid residue substitutions at the Asf1-histone H3/H4 interface do. Finally, we show that residue substitutions in yAsf1 near the CAF-1/HIRA interface also influence yAsf1's function in silencing.",

Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients with DNMT3A(mutant) AML show significantly worse overall survival (OS; P = .022; hazard ratio [HR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.81), and relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .005; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13-2.05) than DNMT3A(wild-type) AMLs.

The effect of DNMT3A mutations in human AML remains elusive, because DNMT3A(mutant) AMLs did not express a methylation or gene expression signature that discriminates them from patients with DNMT3A(wild-type) AML.

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily.

Transglutaminases-2 (Tgase-2) is a group of multifunctional enzymes that plays a role in cancer cell metastasis and bone formation. However, relationship between OPG and Tgase-2 is not studied. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate in the expression of OPG in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Interleukin-1\u03b2 time-dependently induced OPG and Tgase-2 expression in cell lysates and media of the MG-63 cells by a Western blot. Additional 110 kda band was found in the media of MG-63 cells. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate also induced OPG and Tgase-2 expression. However, an 110 kda band was not found in TPA-treated media of MG-63 cells. Cystamine, a Tgase-2 inhibitor, dose-dependently suppressed the expression of OPG in MG-63 cells. Gene silencing of Tgase-2 also signifi cantly suppressed the expression of OPG in MG-63 cells. Next, we examined whether a band of 110 kda of OPG contains an isopeptide bond, an indication of Tgase-2 action, by monoclonal antibody specifi c for the isopeptide bond. However, we could not fi nd the isopeptide bond at 110 kda but 77 kda, which is believed to be the band position of Tgase-2. This suggested that 110 kda is not the direct product of Tgase-2's action. All together, OPG and Tgase-2 is induced by IL-1\u03b2 or TPA in MG-63 cells and Tgase-2 is involved in OPG expression in MG-63 cells.",

OBJECTIVE: An association between cocaine use and stroke has been reported, but few studies have examined cocaine-related neurovascular disease using modern stroke diagnostic techniques. We describe a large cohort of patients with cocaine-related stroke to define the pathophysiology and manifestations of cocaine-related neurovascular disease. METHODS: All adult admissions to a tertiary neurovascular service from July 1, 1998 to July 1, 2008 were screened for evidence of current or previous cocaine use. Patients included underwent thorough review of medical records including diagnostic procedure, laboratory, and imaging results. RESULTS: A total of 5,142 records were screened and 96 patients were identified; 45 (47%) were given the diagnosis of ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), 26 (27%) with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 25 (26%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage. In all, 61 (63.5%) patients were categorized as active and 35 (36.5%) as previous cocaine users. Stroke type differed significantly between active and prior users (P=.004), with active users more likely to have ICH compared with previous users (37.7% v 8.6%) and less likely to have ischemic stroke or TIA (36.1% v 65.7%). The most common stroke/TIA cause was large artery atherosclerosis in 20 (44%) patients. Of the 25 subarachnoid hemorrhage cases, 22 (88%) were aneurysmal. CONCLUSION: Ischemic stroke/TIA is a common neurovascular presentation in patients with a remote history of cocaine use, often as a result of atherosclerotic disease; neither vasculitis nor vasospasm was a common cause of stroke in this cohort. ICH is more common in those currently using cocaine perhaps because of acute spikes in blood pressure. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",

However, it is not clear whether NOTCH1 mutations associate with decreased PTEN expression in primary T-ALL. Here, we compared patients with or without NOTCH1 mutations and report that the former presented higher MYC transcript levels and decreased PTEN mRNA expression.

Accordingly, the T-ALL samples analyzed, irrespectively of their NOTCH1 mutational status, expressed significantly higher PTEN protein levels than normal controls. To evaluate the integrated functional impact of Notch transcriptional and CK2 post-translational inactivation of PTEN, we treated T-ALL cells with both the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT and the CK2 inhibitors DRB/TBB.

The heightened risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) is well established. Several adverse clinical and laboratory predictors have been described. In the current work, we aimed to formulate a predictive score for NHL development, based on clinical, serological, and histopathological findings at the time of SS diagnosis. In the present case-control study of 381 primary SS patients and 92 primary SS patients with concomitant NHL, clinical, serological, and histopathological variables at the time of SS diagnosis were retrospectively recorded. For the identification of predictors for NHL development univariate and multivariate models were constructed. Salivary gland enlargement (SGE), lymphadenopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, anti-Ro/SSA or/and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, monoclonal gammopathy, and C4 hypocomplementemia were shown to be independent predictors for NHL development. On the basis of the number of independent risk factors identified, a predictive risk score for NHL development was formulated. Thus, patients presenting with < 2 risk factors had a 3.8% probability of NHL development, those with 3 to 6 risk factors 39.9% (OR (95%CI): 16.6 [6.5-42.5], P < 0.05), while in the presence of all 7 risk factors the corresponding probability reached 100% (OR [95%CI]: 210.0 [10.0-4412.9], P < 0.0001). In conclusion, an easy to use diagnostic scoring tool for NHL development in the context of SS is presented.

Onto this central building block the other components are bound via multiple interactions. Furthermore, by employing a novel assay, we were able to reconstitute the SMN complex from individual components and confirm the interaction map. Interestingly, SMN protein carrying an SMA-causing mutation was severely impaired in formation of the SMN complex. Finally, we show that the peripheral component Gemin5 contributes an essential activity to the SMN complex, most likely the transfer of Sm proteins onto the U snRNA.

BACKGROUND: Pentraxin-3 (PTX) and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) are new candidate prognostic markers for comorbidities and mortality in various inflammatory diseases. Acute decompensation of cirrhosis is characterized by acute exacerbation of chronic systemic inflammation. Recently, increased circulating PTX levels have been reported in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients and positively correlated with disease severity. This study aims to explore serum PTX/sTWEAK levels and their relationship with clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation. METHODS: We analyzed serum PTX/sTWEAK levels in relation to inhospital and 3-month new clinical events and survivals in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation. RESULTS: During admission, serum PTX/sTWEAK levels were significantly higher in acute decompensated cirrhotic patients than controls and positively correlated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), new infections, long hospital stays, high medical costs, and high mortality. During a 3-month follow-up, acute decompensated cirrhotic patients with high serum PTX/sTWEAK levels had more episodes of unplanned readmission and high 3-month mortality. On multivariate analysis, high PTX/sTWEAK levels and PEW were independent risk factors for high mortality. CONCLUSION: High serum PTX/sTWEAK levels and PEW are common in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation. As compared with low serum PTX and sTWEAK cases, cirrhotic patients with high serum PTX/sTWEAK levels a have higher probability of new severe infections, severe sepsis, septic shock, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, in-hospital, and 3-month follow-up mortalities. Therefore, high serum PTX/sTWEAK levels on hospital admission predict disease severity and case fatality in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation.",

Here we have performed a detailed analysis of the interplay between the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and host cell PARP and its consequences for the host-parasite relationship. Our results have shown that T. gondii significantly decreased PARP expression in its host cells within 10min of infection but that the amount of PARP normalized during prolonged infection. Importantly, down-regulation of PARP expression after infection abrogated the ADP-ribosylation of acceptor proteins in response to oxidative stress. Overexpression of PARP in RAW264.7 cells revealed that elevated amounts of PARP neither affected host cell invasion nor intracellular development of T. gondii in non-stimulated or IFN-gamma/LPS-stimulated monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, measurements of the activities of effector caspases 3 and 7 indicated that the blockade of host cell apoptosis by T. gondii occurs independently of the inhibition of PARP after infection. These findings suggest that the prominent decrease of host cell PARP and poly(ADP-ribos)ylation after parasitic infection do not affect the intracellular development of T. gondii in vitro.",

In 2002, adalimumab became the first human mAb to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, an additional six human mAbs have received FDA approval: panitumumab, golimumab, canakinumab, ustekinumab, ofatumumab and denosumab. In addition, 3 candidates (raxibacumab, belimumab and ipilimumab) are currently under review by the FDA, 7 are in Phase III studies and 81 are in either Phase I or II studies.

Based on level I evidence, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) should be considered in selected men to prevent incident prostate cancer. Level I evidence also supports the consideration of dutasteride, a 5-ARI, for tertiary prevention in active surveillance and biochemical recurrence patients. Vitamins and supplements, including selenium or vitamin E, have not been proven in clinical trials to prevent prostate cancer and in the case of Vitamin E has been found to increase the risk of incident prostate cancer.

BCC, SCC and NS expressed several CD44v, including v6, albeit in different distributions and intensities. PMM, MMM and BMN expressed isoforms containing v7/8 and v10, but failed to express epitopes encoded by v5 or v6. Thus, different CD44 isoforms are found in human skin cancers and are modulated during carcinogenesis. However, we did not observe a correlation of CD44v6 expression with metastatic potential.",

PURPOSE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the miRNAs that are frequently and highly overexpressed in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; however, only a little is known about its functional role in CRC. METHODS: We examined the expression level of miR-21 in 44 paired samples of tumoral and non-tumoral colon tissues diagnosed for CRC using TaqMan real-time PCR method. Furthermore, we used miR-21 inhibitor (anti-miR-21) to transient knockdown of miR-21 in DLD-1 colon cancer cells and examined the effects of miR-21 silencing on viability, apoptosis, chemosensitivity, cell cycle, and migration of DLD1 cells. RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-21 were significantly increased in CRC tumor tissue (P < 0.0001). Significant differences in miR-21 levels were observed also between CRC tissues of patients with CRC in different clinical stages: I vs. II (P = 0.033) and I vs. IV (P = 0.021). Kaplan-Meier analysis proved that the miR-21 expression levels are correlated to shorter overall survival of CRC patients (P = 0.0341). MiR-21 silencing in DLD1 cell line had no effect on the cell viability; however, when combined with chemotherapeutics (5-FU, L-OHP, and SN38), it contributed to the decrease of cell viability. Suppression of miR-21 decreased cell migration ability of DLD-1 cells by nearly 30 % (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: We have confirmed the overexpression of miR-21 in CRC samples and its correlation with advanced disease and shorter overall survival. These findings could be described in part by the fact that CRC cells with increased expression of miR-21 have higher migration ability.",

OBJECTIVE: The disease association of the common 1858C>T Arg620Trp (rs2476601) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of protein tyrosine phosphatase; nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) on chromosome 1p13 has been confirmed in type 1 diabetes and also in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease. Some studies have reported additional associated SNPs independent of rs2476601/Trp(620), suggesting that it may not be the sole causal variant in the region and that the relative risk of rs2476601/Trp(620) is greater in lower risk by HLA class II genotypes than in the highest risk class II risk category. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We resequenced PTPN22 and used these and other data to provide >150 SNPs to evaluate the association of the PTPN22 gene and its flanking chromosome region with type 1 diabetes in a minimum of 2,000 case subjects and 2,400 control subjects. RESULTS: Due to linkage disequilibrium, we were unable to distinguish between rs2476601/Trp(620) (P = 2.11 x10(-87)) and rs6679677 (P = 3.21 x10(-87)), an intergenic SNP between the genes putative homeodomain transcription factor 1 and round spermatid basic protein 1. None of the previously reported disease-associated SNPs proved to be independent of rs2476601/Trp(620). We did not detect any interaction with age at diagnosis or sex. However, we found that rs2476601/Trp(620) has a higher relative risk in type 1 diabetic case subjects carrying lower risk HLA class II genotypes than in those carrying higher risk ones (P = 1.36 x 10(-4) in a test of interaction). CONCLUSIONS: In our datasets, there was no evidence for allelic heterogeneity at the PTPN22 locus in type 1 diabetes, indicating that the SNP rs2476601/Trp(620) remains the best candidate in this chromosome region in European populations. The heterogeneity of rs2476601/Trp(620) disease risk by HLA class II genotype is consistent with previous studies, and the joint effect of the two loci is still greater in the high-risk group.",

Peripheral neurons can regenerate after axotomy; in this process, the role of cytoskeletal proteins is important because they contribute to formation and reorganization, growth, transport, stability and plasticity of axons. In the present study, we examined the effects of thyroid hormones (T3) on the expression of major cytoskeletal proteins during sciatic nerve regeneration. At various times after sciatic nerve transection and T3 local administration, segments of operated nerves from T3-treated rats and control rats were examined by Western blotting for the presence of neurofilament, tubulin and vimentin. Our results revealed that, during the first week after surgery, T3 treatment did not significantly alter the level of NF subunits and tubulin in the different segments of operated nerves compared to control nerves. Two or 4 weeks after operation, the concentration of NF-H and NF-M isoforms was clearly increased by T3 treatment. Moreover, under T3-treatment, NF proteins appeared more rapidly in the distal segment of operated nerves. Likewise, the levels of betaIII, and of acetylated and tyrosinated tubulin isotypes, were also up-regulated by T3-treatment during regeneration. However, only the tyrosinated tubulin form appeared earlier in the distal nerve segments. At this stage of regeneration, T3 had no effect on the level of vimentin expression. In conclusion, thyroid hormone improves and accelerates peripheral nerve regeneration and exerts a positive effect on cytoskeletal protein expression and transport involved in axonal regeneration. These results help us to understand partially the mechanism by which thyroid hormones enhance peripheral nerve regeneration. The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential.",

At least 5 complementation groups (FA-A to FA-E) underlie FA and the gene defective in FA-C (FAC) has been cloned. The mouse orthologue, Fac, maps in close proximity to the f locus, on chromosome 13, which codes for the flexed-tail mouse phenotype, raising the possibility that f and Fac are synonymous. If this were the case flexed-tail mice could be used as mouse models for FA-C to help determine the basic defect and to evaluate clinical intervention and gene therapy. To further characterize the flexed-tail mouse, the frequency of micronuclei (a measure of chromosomal aberrations) induced by mitomycin C (MMC), an alkylating and DNA cross-linking agent, was analyzed in peripheral blood and bone marrow erythrocytes. Although a higher spontaneous micronucleus frequency was seen in flexed tail mice in comparison to wild-type mice, the sensitivity to MMC was not elevated.

Accordingly, the effects of verapamil, a Ca2+ antagonist, on cardiac function, ultrastructure, and high-energy phosphate stores in the myocardium were evaluated in rats made diabetic by an intravenous injection of streptozocin (65 mg/kg). Four weeks after the induction of diabetes, the animals were treated with three doses (2, 4, or 8 mg.kg-1.day-1) of verapamil for 4 wk until they were used for the measurement of different parameters. Untreated diabetic animals had slower heart rates, depressed rate of contraction and rate of relaxation, lower peak left ventricular systolic pressure, and elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure. All of these changes were significantly improved in diabetic rats receiving verapamil treatment. The beneficial effects of verapamil were more evident with higher doses (8 mg.kg-1.day-1) than with the lower doses (2 mg.kg-1.day-1). The diabetic animals also showed alterations in myocardial high-energy phosphate stores and exhibited evidence of ultrastructural damage; these abnormalities were improved by verapamil treatment without affecting their hyperglycemic status.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relation between selenium supplementation after diagnosis and prostate cancer outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively followed 4459 men initially diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1988 through 2010 and examined whether selenium supplement use (from selenium-specific supplements and multivitamins) after diagnosis was associated with risk of biochemical recurrence, prostate cancer mortality, and, secondarily, cardiovascular disease mortality and overall mortality, using Cox proportional hazards models. All P values were from two-sided tests. RESULTS: We documented 965 deaths, 226 (23.4%) because of prostate cancer and 267 (27.7%) because of cardiovascular disease, during a median follow-up of 8.9 years. In the biochemical recurrence analysis, we documented 762 recurrences during a median follow-up of 7.8 years. Crude rates per 1000 person-years for prostate cancer death were 5.6 among selenium nonusers and 10.5 among men who consumed 140 or more \u03bcg/day. Crude rates per 1000 person-years were 28.2 vs 23.5 for all-cause mortality and 28.4 vs 29.3 for biochemical recurrence, for nonuse vs highest-dose categories, respectively. In multivariable analyses, men who consumed 1 to 24 \u03bcg/day, 25 to 139 \u03bcg/day, and 140 or more \u03bcg/day of supplemental selenium had a 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 1.91), 1.33 (95% CI = 0.77 to 2.30), and 2.60-fold (95% CI = 1.44 to 4.70) greater risk of prostate cancer mortality compared with nonusers, respectively, P trend = .001. There was no statistically significant association between selenium supplement use and biochemical recurrence, cardiovascular disease mortality, or overall mortality. CONCLUSION: Selenium supplementation of 140 or more \u03bcg/day after diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality. Caution is warranted regarding usage of such supplements among men with prostate cancer.",

BACKGROUND: Current Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are performed in a single trait framework without considering genetic correlations between important disease traits. Hence, the GWAS have limitations in discovering genetic risk factors affecting pleiotropic effects. RESULTS: This work reports a novel data mining approach to discover patterns of multiple phenotypic associations over 52 anthropometric and biochemical traits in KARE and a new analytical scheme for GWAS of multivariate phenotypes defined by the discovered patterns. This methodology applied to the GWAS for multivariate phenotype highLDLhighTG derived from the predicted patterns of the phenotypic associations. The patterns of the phenotypic associations were informative to draw relations between plasma lipid levels with bone mineral density and a cluster of common traits (Obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance) related to Metabolic Syndrome (MS). A total of 15 SNPs in six genes (PAK7, C20orf103, NRIP1, BCL2, TRPM3, and NAV1) were identified for significant associations with highLDLhighTG. Noteworthy findings were that the significant associations included a mis-sense mutation (PAK7:R335P), a frame shift mutation (C20orf103) and SNPs in splicing sites (TRPM3). CONCLUSIONS: The six genes corresponded to rat and mouse quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had shown associations with the common traits such as the well characterized MS and even tumor susceptibility. Our findings suggest that the six genes may play important roles in the pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and the MS, which increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

PURPOSE: To better understand microRNA miR-21 function in carcinogenesis, we analyzed miR-21 expression patterns in different stages of colorectal cancer development using in situ hybridization (ISH). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Locked nucleic acid (LNA)/DNA probes and a biotin-free tyramide signal amplification system were used in ISH analyses of miRNA expression. Conditions for specific detection of miR-21 were determined using human cell lines and miR-21-expressing lentiviral vectors. Expression was determined in 39 surgically excised colorectal tumors and 34 endoscopically resected colorectal polyps. RESULTS: In the surgical samples, miR-21 expression was much higher in colorectal cancers than in normal mucosa. Strong miR-21 expression was also observed in cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts, suggesting miR-21 induction by cancer-secreted cytokines. Protein expression of PDCD4, a miR-21 target, was inversely correlated with miR-21 expression, confirming that miR-21 is indeed a negative regulator of PDCD4 in vivo. In the endoscopic samples, miR-21 expression was very high in malignant adenocarcinomas but was not elevated in nontumorigenic polyps. Precancerous adenomas also frequently showed miR-21 up-regulation. CONCLUSION: Using the LNA-ISH system for miRNA detection, miR-21 was detectable in precancerous adenomas. The frequency and extent of miR-21 expression increased during the transition from precancerous colorectal adenoma to advanced carcinoma. Expression patterns of miR-21 RNA and its target, tumor suppressor protein PDCD4, were mutually exclusive.

We carried out an immunohistochemical examination for DNMT1 in 34 samples of histologically normal squamous epithelium, 36 samples of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 61 samples of higher-grade CIN and 30 samples of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The DNMT1 protein expression score, reflecting the intensity and incidence of DNMT1 nuclear immunoreactivity, was increased even in low-grade CIN (P<0.0001) in comparison with histologically normal squamous epithelium and was further increased in higher-grade CIN (P<0.0001 compared to low-grade CIN). The DNMT1 protein expression score remained at a plateau in microinvasive carcinoma (Stage IA, P=0.0690 compared to higher-grade CIN) and then decreased with cancer invasion (Stage IB or more, P=0.0176 compared to Stage IA), whereas the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index did not decrease with cancer invasion (P=0.8259 between Stage IA and Stage IB or more). Thus, the DNMT1 protein expression score and the PCNA labeling index were not mutually correlated in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (P=0.2304). These data suggest that progressively increasing expression of DNMT1 protein is not entirely a secondary result of increased cell proliferative activity, but is associated with an early step of multistage cervical carcinogenesis.",

Using recombinant DNA technology for expression of protein therapeutics is a maturing field of pharmaceutical research and development. As recombinant proteins are increasingly utilized as biotherapeutics, improved methodologies ensuring the characterization of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are needed. Typically, proteins prepared for PTM analysis are proteolytically digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry. To ensure full coverage of the PTMs on a given protein, one must obtain complete sequence coverage of the protein, which is often quite challenging. The objective of the research described here is to design a protocol that maximizes protein sequence coverage and enables detection of post-translational modifications, specifically N-linked glycosylation. To achieve this objective, a highly efficient proteolytic digest protocol using trypsin was designed by comparing the relative merits of denaturing agents (urea and Rapigest SF), reducing agents [dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phophine (TCEP)], and various concentrations of alkylating agent [iodoacetamide (IAM)]. After analysis of human apo-transferrin using various protease digestion protocols, ideal conditions were determined to contain 6 M urea for denaturation, 5 mM TCEP for reduction, 10 mM IAM for alkylation, and 10 mM DTT, to quench excess IAM before the addition of trypsin. This method was successfully applied to a novel recombinant protein, human lysyl oxidase-like 2. Furthermore, the glycosylation PTMs were readily detected at two glycosylation sites in the protein. These digestion conditions were specifically designed for PTM analysis of recombinant proteins and biotherapeutics, and the work described herein fills an unmet need in the growing field of biopharmaceutical analysis.",

A number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy 8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol 445:147-157, 2008). The same principles apply to models of OIS in culture. Thus, in this chapter, we describe how to generate OIS cells using human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), the best-characterized cell model of OIS, and how to detect autophagy, particularly focusing on immunofluorescence methods.",

Kummell's disease is a spinal disorder characterized by delayed post-traumatic collapse of a vertebral body with avascular necrosis. Although definitive treatment for Kummell's disease has not been established, it has been reported that percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty has shown good results. However, these procedures are not recommended for severely collapsed vertebral bodies because of the risk of cement leakage or technical difficulties. Authors report a rare case of spontaneous reduction in vertebral height by the insertion of a working cannula into the vertebral body in Kummell's disease.",

This study determined whether expression levels of a panel of biologically relevant microRNAs can be used as prognostic or predictive biomarkers in patients who participated in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT), the largest randomized study conducted to date of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with radically resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. The prognostic and predictive values of microRNA expression for survival were studied using a Cox model, which included every factor used in the stratified randomization, clinicopathologic prognostic factors, and other factors statistically related to microRNA expression. Investigation of the expression pattern of microRNAs in situ was performed. We also analyzed the association of TP53 mutation status and miR-34a/b/c expression, epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutation status, and miR-21 and Let-7a expression. Finally, the association of p16 and miR-29b expression was assessed. Overall, no significant association was found between any of the tested microRNAs and survival, with the exception of miR-21 for which a deleterious prognostic effect of lowered expression was suggested. Otherwise, no single or combinatorial microRNA expression profile predicted response to adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Together, our results indicate that the microRNA expression patterns examined were neither predictive nor prognostic in a large patient cohort with radically resected NSCLC, randomized to receive adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus follow-up only.",
