          "context": "Mercedes Benz pattern craniosynostosis. BACKGROUND: The complex craniosynostoses, which include all nonsyndromic multiple sutural fusions, represent a small fraction of patients presenting with craniosynostosis. Among these are a trisutural fusion, dubbed the \"Mercedes Benz pattern,\" involving the sagittal and both lambdoid sutures. The purpose of this report is to review the authors' series of this unusual form of craniosynostosis, to identify associated anomalies, and to assess treatment outcomes. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective clinical outcome assessment of all patients presenting with Mercedes Benz pattern craniosynostosis. Growth was assessed by direct anthropologic measurements, and significance was assessed by the t test. RESULTS: Over a 17-year period, 11 of 802 patients presenting with craniosynostosis were identified with Mercedes Benz pattern synostosis (1.4 percent). Three patients had additional sutural involvement and two had identifiable genetic syndromes. Seven of 11 (64 percent) had cerebellar tonsillar herniation on preoperative imaging, and four symptomatic patients (36 percent) have required Chiari decompressions. Three patients have required more than one remodeling procedure. Serial postoperative anthropologic measurements identified progressive brachycephaly, with diminished growth in both head circumference and skull length (mean follow-up, 3.75 years). Cognitive function was grossly normal, except for one syndromic patient. CONCLUSIONS: Despite fusion of the sagittal suture, the surgical treatment for Mercedes Benz pattern craniosynostosis should include skull lengthening, not reduction. The authors' findings for diminished postoperative growth suggest that an overcorrection be considered. Fourth or fifth sutural involvement correlated with additional corrections. Given the observed high incidence for symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar herniation, routine magnetic resonance evaluations are recommended for affected individuals."

Here we report an 18-year-old boy diagnosed as having Allgrove syndrome, with ACTH resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia, alacrimia, and severe motor polyneuropathy. Alacrimia was the earliest feature evident at the age of 8 years. He presented with achalasia and adrenal insufficiency at 12 and 18 years respectively and developed neurological symptoms in the form of severe muscle wasting at the age of 15 years. Patients with Allgrove syndrome usually manifest adrenal insufficiency and achalasia during first decade of life. Our patient manifested adrenal insufficiency and achalasia in the second decade and manifested neurological dysfunction before adrenal dysfunction."

OBJECT: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder involving stenosis of the major vessels of the circle of Willis and proximal portions of its principal branches. Despite concerted investigation, the pathophysiology of the disorder has not been fully elucidated. Currently, the major proteins believed to play an active role in the pathogenesis include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b2\u2081 (TGF\u03b2\u2081), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In terms of the genetics, recent literature suggests a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmission involving chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17 for familial MMD. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the histopathology, pathophysiology and genetics of MMD. METHODS: A PubMed/Medline systematic study of the literature was performed, from which 45 articles regarding MMD pathophysiology were identified and analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Moyamoya disease is characterized by the intimal thickening and media attenuation of the proximal vessels of the circle of Willis as well as the development of an aberrant distal vascular network. The primary proteins that are currently implicated in the pathophysiology of MMD include VEGF, bFGF, HGF, TGF\u03b2\u2081, and G-CSF. Furthermore, the current literature on familial MMD has pointed to a low penetrance autosomal dominant or polygenic mode of transmittance at loci on chromosomes 3, 6, 8, 12, and 17."

Oncogene-induced senescence is an important mechanism by which normal cells are restrained from malignant transformation. Here we report that the suppression of the c-Myc (MYC) oncogene induces cellular senescence in diverse tumor types including lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. MYC inactivation was associated with prototypical markers of senescence, including acidic beta-gal staining, induction of p16INK4a, and p15INK4b expression. Moreover, MYC inactivation induced global changes in chromatin structure associated with the marked reduction of histone H4 acetylation and increased histone H3 K9 methylation. Osteosarcomas engineered to be deficient in p16INK4a or Rb exhibited impaired senescence and failed to exhibit sustained tumor regression upon MYC inactivation. Similarly, only after lymphomas were repaired for p53 expression did MYC inactivation induce robust senescence and sustained tumor regression. The pharmacologic inhibition of signaling pathways implicated in oncogene-induced senescence including ATM/ATR and MAPK did not prevent senescence associated with MYC inactivation. Our results suggest that cellular senescence programs remain latently functional, even in established tumors, and can become reactivated, serving as a critical mechanism of oncogene addiction associated with MYC inactivation."

Since dovitinib is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and targets brain tumor-relevant pathways, we conducted a phase I trial to demonstrate its safety in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with first or second GBM recurrence started treatment with the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) previously established in systemic cancer patients (500\u00a0mg/d, 5\u00a0days on/2\u00a0days off). A modified 3\u00a0+\u00a03 design in three cohorts (500, 400, 300\u00a0mg) was used. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled. Seventy-two adverse events (AEs) occurred and 16.7\u00a0% of AEs were classified as > CTC grade 3 toxicity, mainly including hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity. Only one out of six patients of the 300-mg cohort showed grade 3 toxicity. The PFS-6 rate was 16.7\u00a0%, and it was not associated with detection of the FGFR-TACC gene fusion in the tumor. CONCLUSION: Dovitinib is safe in patients with recurrent GBM and showed efficacy in only some patients unselected for target expression. The recommended phase II dose of 300\u00a0mg would be substantially lower than the recently established MTD in systemic cancer patients. Further personalized trials are recommended."

Autoantibodies to the smaller isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) can be found in patients with type 1 diabetes and a number of neurological disorders, including stiff-person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia and limbic encephalitis. The detection of disease-specific autoantibody epitopes led to the hypothesis that distinct GAD autoantibodies may elicit specific neurological phenotypes. We explored the in vitro/in vivo effects of well-characterized monoclonal GAD antibodies. We found that GAD autoantibodies present in patients with stiff person syndrome (n = 7) and cerebellar ataxia (n = 15) recognized an epitope distinct from that recognized by GAD autoantibodies present in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 10) or limbic encephalitis (n = 4). We demonstrated that the administration of a monoclonal GAD antibody representing this epitope specificity; (1) disrupted in vitro the association of GAD with \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid containing synaptic vesicles; (2) depressed the inhibitory synaptic transmission in cerebellar slices with a gradual time course and a lasting suppressive effect; (3) significantly decreased conditioned eyelid responses evoked in mice, with no modification of learning curves in the classical eyeblink-conditioning task; (4) markedly impaired the facilitatory effect exerted by the premotor cortex over the motor cortex in a paired-pulse stimulation paradigm; and (5) induced decreased exploratory behavior and impaired locomotor function in rats. These findings support the specific targeting of GAD by its autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of stiff-person syndrome and cerebellar ataxia. Therapies of these disorders based on selective removal of such GAD antibodies could be envisioned."

INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression pattern and function of miRNAs in CD4+ T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The expression profile of miRNAs in CD4+ T cells from synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood of 33 RA patients was determined by microarray assay and validated by qRT-PCR analysis. The correlation between altered expression of miRNAs and cytokine levels was determined by linear regression analysis. The role of miR-146a overexpression in regulating T cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. A genome-wide gene expression analysis was further performed to identify miR-146a-regulated genes in T cells. RESULTS: miRNA expression profile analysis revealed that miR-146a expression was significantly upregulated while miR-363 and miR-498 were downregulated in CD4+ T cells of RA patients. The level of miR-146a expression was positively correlated with levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and in vitro studies showed TNF-alpha upregulated miR-146a expression in T cells. Moreover, miR-146a overexpression was found to suppress Jurkat T cell apoptosis. Finally, transcriptome analysis of miR-146a overexpression in T cells identified Fas associated factor 1 (FAF1) as a miR-146a-regulated gene, which was critically involved in modulating T cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We have detected increased miR-146a in CD4+ T cells of RA patients and its close correlation with TNF-alpha levels. Our findings that miR-146a overexpression suppresses T cell apoptosis indicate a role of miR-146a in RA pathogenesis and provide potential novel therapeutic targets."

Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks."

Among these genes, SF3B1, encoding a subunit of the spliceosomal U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), is somatically mutated in 9.7% of affected individuals. Further analysis in 279 individuals with CLL showed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with faster disease progression and poor overall survival. This work provides the first comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations in CLL with relevant clinical correlates and defines a large set of new genes that may drive the development of this common form of leukemia.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether KCNQ1 mutations in highly conserved amino acid residues within the voltage-gated potassium channel family are associated with an increased risk of cardiac events. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population involved 492 LQT1 patients with 54 missense mutations in the transmembrane region of the KCNQ1 channel. The amino acid sequences of the transmembrane region of 38 human voltage-gated potassium channels were aligned. An adjusted Shannon entropy score for each amino acid residue was calculated ranging from 0 (no conservation) to 1.0 (full conservation). Cox analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the first cardiac event (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or death). Patients were subcategorized into tertiles by their adjusted Shannon entropy scores. The lowest tertile (score 0-0.469; n = 146) was used as a reference group; patients with intermediate tertile scores (0.470-0.665; n = 150) had no increased risk of cardiac events (HR = 1.19, P = 0.42) or aborted cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death (HR = 1.58, P = 0.26), and those with the highest tertile scores (>0.665; n = 196) showed significantly increased risk of cardiac events (HR = 3.32, P <0.001) and aborted cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death (HR = 2.62, P = 0.04). The increased risk in patients with the highest conservation scores was independent of QTc, gender, age, and beta-blocker therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in highly conserved amino acid residues in the KCNQ1 gene are associated with a significant risk of cardiac events independent of QTc, gender, and beta-blocker therapy."

Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function and regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR complexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions, we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor complex is abundant in both compartments. Rapamycin negatively regulates the formation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on mTORC2 remained elusive. We describe that in primary cells short-term treatment with rapamycin triggers dephosphorylation of rictor and sin1 exclusively in the cytoplasm, but does not affect mTORC2 assembly. Prolonged drug treatment leads to complete dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear rictor and sin1 accompanied by inhibition of mTORC2 assembly. The distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear upstream and downstream effectors of mTOR are involved in many cancers and human genetic diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, polycystic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and diabetes. Accordingly, analogs of rapamycin are currently tested in many different clinical trials. Our data allow new insights into the molecular consequences of mTOR dysregulation under pathophysiological conditions and should help to optimize rapamycin treatment of human diseases."

Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 148 patients (75.1%) with a higher success rate in HNPP and CMT1 than CMT2. Only four genes (PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, and GDAP1) accounted for 92% of all genetically confirmed CMT cases. In CMT1, PMP22 duplication was the most common mutation while the second gene in order of frequency was MPZ in familial and SH3TC2 in isolated cases. In CMT2, GJB1 was the most frequent mutated gene and GJB1 with GDAP1 accounted for almost 3/4 of genetically defined CMT2 patients. The first gene in order of frequency was GJB1 in familial and GDAP1 in isolated cases. In HNPP, the majority of patients harbored the PMP22 gene deletion. The novelty of our data is the relatively high frequency of SH3TC2 and GDAP1 mutations in demyelinating and axonal forms, respectively. These epidemiological data can help in panel design for our patients' population."

The H19 large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) is one of the most highly abundant and conserved transcripts in mammalian development, being expressed in both embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages, yet its physiological function is unknown. Here we show that miR-675, a microRNA (miRNA) embedded in H19's first exon, is expressed exclusively in the placenta from the gestational time point when placental growth normally ceases, and placentas that lack H19 continue to grow. Overexpression of miR-675 in a range of embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lines results in their reduced proliferation; targets of the miRNA are upregulated in the H19 null placenta, including the growth-promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) gene. Moreover, the excision of miR-675 from H19 is dynamically regulated by the stress-response RNA-binding protein HuR. These results suggest that H19's main physiological role is in limiting growth of the placenta before birth, by regulated processing of miR-675. The controlled release of miR-675 from H19 may also allow rapid inhibition of cell proliferation in response to cellular stress or oncogenic signals."

Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail. Methylated ARK(S/T) motifs have recently been identified in other chromatin factors (e.g. linker histone H1.4 and lysine methyltransferase G9a). These are thought to function as peripheral docking sites for the HP1 chromodomain. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. These have putative functions ranging from establishment of histone H4 acetylation during spermiogenesis to regulation of transcription co-repressor complexes. To delineate the biochemical functions of the CDY family chromodomains, we analyzed their specificity of methyllysine recognition. We detected substantial differences among these factors. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. However, point mutations can rescue binding. In support of the in vitro binding properties of the chromodomains, the full-length CDY family proteins exhibit substantial variability in chromatin localization. Our studies underscore the significance of subtle sequence differences in a conserved signaling module for diverse epigenetic regulatory pathways."

The ability to efficiently generate integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the most readily available source-peripheral blood-has the potential to expedite the advances of iPSC-based therapies. We have successfully generated integration-free iPSCs from cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells with improved oriP/EBNA1-based episomal vectors (EV) using a strong spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Here we show that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, MYC, and KLF4)-expressing EV can also reprogram adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) into pluripotency, yet at a very low efficiency. We found that inclusion of BCL-XL increases the reprogramming efficiency by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, culture of CD3(-)/CD19(-) cells or T/B cell-depleted MNCs for 4-6 days led to the generation of 20-30 iPSC colonies from 1 ml PB, an efficiency that is substantially higher than previously reported. PB iPSCs express pluripotency markers, form teratomas, and can be induced to differentiate in vitro into mesenchymal stem cells, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes. Used together, our optimized factor combination and reprogramming strategy lead to efficient generation of integration-free iPSCs from adult PB. This discovery has potential applications in iPSC banking, disease modeling and regenerative medicine."

Protein-protein interactions usually involve a large number of residues; thus it is difficult to elucidate functional and structural roles of specific residues located in the interface. This problem is particularly challenging for ankyrin repeat proteins (ARs), which consist of linear arrays of small repeating units and play critical roles in almost every life process via protein-protein interactions, because the residues involved are discontinuously dispersed in both the ARs and their partners. Our previous studies showed that while both specific CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4A (P16) and gankyrin bind to cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) in similar fashion, only P16 inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4. While this could explain why P16 is a tumor suppressor and gankyrin is oncogenic, the structural basis of these contrasting properties was unknown. Here we show that a double mutant of gankyrin, L62H/I79D, inhibits the kinase activity of CDK4, similar to P16, and such CDK4-inhibtory activity is associated with the I79D but not L62H mutation. In addition, mutations at I79 and L62 bring about a moderate decrease in the stability of gankyrin. Further structural and biophysical analyses suggest that the substitution of Ile79 with Asp leads to local conformational changes in loops I-III of gankyrin. Taken together, our results allow the dissection of the \"protein-protein binding\" and \"CDK4 inhibition\" functions of P16, show that the difference between tumor suppressing and oncogenic functions of P16 and gankyrin, respectively, mainly resides in a single residue, and provide structural insight to the contrasting biological functions of the two AR proteins."

BACKGROUND: A feature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) relevant to tumour dissemination is the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton/focal contacts, influencing cellular ECM adherence and motility. This is coupled with the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, often mediated by Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb1/deltaEF1. These genes, overexpressed in breast carcinomas, are known targets of growth factor-initiated pathways, however it is less clear how alterations in ECM attachment cross-modulate to regulate these pathways. EGF induces EMT in the breast cancer cell line PMC42-LA and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (ST) induces EMT in embryonic neural epithelial cells, with F-actin de-bundling and disruption of cell-cell adhesion, via inhibition of aPKC. METHODS: PMC42-LA cells were treated for 72 h with 10 ng/ml EGF, 40 nM ST, or both, and assessed for expression of E-cadherin repressor genes (Snail1, Snail2, Zeb1/deltaEF1) and EMT-related genes by QRT-PCR, multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) and immunofluorescence +/- cycloheximide. Actin and focal contacts (paxillin) were visualized by confocal microscopy. A public database of human breast cancers was assessed for expression of Snail1 and Snail2 in relation to outcome. RESULTS: When PMC42-LA were treated with EGF, Snail2 was the principal E-cadherin repressor induced. With ST or ST+EGF this shifted to Snail1, with more extreme EMT and Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction seen with ST+EGF. ST reduced stress fibres and focal contact size rapidly and independently of gene transcription. Gene expression analysis by MT-PCR indicated that ST repressed many genes which were induced by EGF (EGFR, CAV1, CTGF, CYR61, CD44, S100A4) and induced genes which alter the actin cytoskeleton (NLF1, NLF2, EPHB4). Examination of the public database of breast cancers revealed tumours exhibiting higher Snail1 expression have an increased risk of disease-recurrence. This was not seen for Snail2, and Zeb1/deltaEF1 showed a reverse correlation with lower expression values being predictive of increased risk. CONCLUSION: ST in combination with EGF directed a greater EMT via actin depolymerisation and focal contact size reduction, resulting in a loosening of cell-ECM attachment along with Snail1-Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction. This appeared fundamentally different to the EGF-induced EMT, highlighting the multiple pathways which can regulate EMT. Our findings add support for a functional role for Snail1 in invasive breast cancer."

Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes. MAIN METHODS: db/db mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were examined after 2 and 4 months of diabetes. Groups of diabetic animals were treated with oral macitentan (25mg/kg/day). The animals were monitored with respect to body weight and blood glucose. Urine analyses were performed for albumin. Cardiac hemodynamic studies were carried out. Renal, cardiac and retinal tissues were analyzed for ET-1, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibronectin (FN), extradomain B containing FN (EDB(+)FN) and collagen \u03b1-I (IV) mRNA. Cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured. Protein expressions were measured by ELISA and Western blot. Microscopic analyses were performed in the kidneys. KEY FINDINGS: Diabetic animals showed hyperglycemia, increased urinary albumin and augmented serum creatinine levels. Diabetes caused increased renal, cardiac and retinal ET-1, TGF-\u03b21, VEGF, FN, EDB(+)FN, collagen \u03b1-I(IV) mRNA expression along with increased FN and collagen protein and NF-\u03baB activation. Diabetic mice also demonstrated mesangial expansion, cardiac dysfunction and increased expression of ANP and BNP. Treatment with macitentan attenuated such abnormalities. SIGNIFICANCE: These experiments confirmed that ET system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic complications in type 2 diabetes. Such diabetes induced changes can be reduced macitentan therapy."

The internal contamination with depleted uranium (DU) isotopes was detected in British, Canadian, and United States Gulf War veterans as late as nine years after inhalational exposure to radioactive dust in the Persian Gulf War I. DU isotopes were also identified in a Canadian veteran's autopsy samples of lung, liver, kidney, and bone. In soil samples from Kosovo, hundreds of particles, mostly less than 5 microm in size, were found in milligram quantities. Gulf War I in 1991 resulted in 350 metric tons of DU deposited in the environment and 3-6 million grams of DU aerosol released into the atmosphere. Its legacy, Gulf War disease, is a complex, progressive, incapacitating multiorgan system disorder. The symptoms include incapacitating fatigue, musculoskeletel and joint pains, headaches, neuropsychiatric disorders, affect changes, confusion, visual problems, changes of gait, loss of memory, lymphadenopathies, respiratory impairment, impotence, and urinary tract morphological and functional alterations. Current understanding of its etiology seems far from being adequate. After the Afghanistan Operation Anaconda (2002), our team studied the population of Jalalabad, Spin Gar, Tora Bora, and Kabul areas, and identified civilians with the symptoms similar to those of Gulf War syndrome. Twenty-four-hour urine samples from 8 symptomatic subjects were collected by the following criteria: 1) the onset of symptoms relative to the bombing raids; 2) physical presence in the area of the bombing; and 3) clinical manifestations. Control subjects were selected among the sympotom-free residents in non-targeted areas. All samples were analyzed for the concentration and ratio of four uranium isotopes, (234)U, (235)U, (236)U and (238)U, by using a multicollector, inductively coupled plasma ionization mass spectrometry. The first results from the Jalalabad province revealed urinary excretion of total uranium in all subjects significantly exceeding the values in the nonexposed population. The analysis of the isotopic ratios identified non-depleted uranium. Studies of specimens collected in 2002 revealed uranium concentrations up to 200 times higher in the districts of Tora Bora, Yaka Toot, Lal Mal, Makam Khan Farm, Arda Farm, Bibi Mahro, Poli Cherki, and the Kabul airport than in the control population. Uranium levels in the soil samples from the bombsites show values two to three times higher than worldwide concentration levels of 2 to 3 mg/kg and significantly higher concentrations in water than the World Health Organization maximum permissible levels. This growing body of evidence undoubtedly puts the problem of prevention and solution of the DU contamination high on the priority list."

This study adopts a Reverse Vaccinology approach to identify common vaccine candidates from both highly pathogenic species Leishmania major and Leishmania infantum. Total proteome of both species were compared to identify common proteins, which are further taken for sub-cellular localization and transmembrane helices prediction. Plasma membrane proteins having only one transmembrane helix were first identified and analyzed which are non-homologous in human and mouse in order to avoid molecular mimicry with other proteins. Selected proteins were analyzed for their binding efficiency to both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II alleles. As a result, 19 potential epitopes are screened in this study using different approaches, which can be further verified through in vivo experiments in MHC compatible animal models. This study demonstrates that Reverse Vaccinology approach has potential in discovering various immunogenic antigens from in silico analysis of pathogen's genome or proteome instead of culturing the whole organism by conventional methods."

Defined as clinically unexplained hypertrophy of the left ventricle, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is traditionally understood as a disease of the cardiac sarcomere. Mutations in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C (cTnC) are a relatively rare cause of HCM. Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation and aborted sudden cardiac death. Diagnosed at age 5, the proband is family history-negative for HCM or sudden cardiac death, suggesting a de novo mutation. TnC-extracted cardiac skinned fibers were reconstituted with the cTnC-A31S mutant, which increased Ca(2+) sensitivity with no effect on the maximal contractile force generation. Reconstituted actomyosin ATPase assays with 50% cTnC-A31S:50% cTnC-WT demonstrated Ca(2+) sensitivity that was intermediate between 100% cTnC-A31S and 100% cTnC-WT, whereas the mutant increased the activation of the actomyosin ATPase without affecting the inhibitory qualities of the ATPase. The secondary structure of the cTnC mutant was evaluated by circular dichroism, which did not indicate global changes in structure. Fluorescence studies demonstrated increased Ca(2+) affinity in isolated cTnC, the troponin complex, thin filament, and to a lesser degree, thin filament with myosin subfragment 1. These results suggest that this mutation has a direct effect on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilament, which may alter Ca(2+) handling and contribute to the arrhythmogenesis observed in the proband. In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM."

AIMS: The risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban when compared with warfarin reduced the rate of stroke, death, and bleeding. We evaluated these outcomes in relation to patient age. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 18 201 patients with AF and a raised risk of stroke were randomized to warfarin or apixaban 5 mg b.d. with dose reduction to 2.5 mg b.d. or placebo in 831 patients with > 2 of the following criteria: age > 80 years, body weight < 60 kg, or creatinine > 133 \u03bcmol/L. We used Cox models to compare outcomes in relation to patient age during 1.8 years median follow-up. Of the trial population, 30% were <65 years, 39% were 65 to <75, and 31% were > 75 years. The rates of stroke, all-cause death, and major bleeding were higher in the older age groups (P < 0.001 for all). Apixaban was more effective than warfarin in preventing stroke and reducing mortality across all age groups, and associated with less major bleeding, less total bleeding, and less intracranial haemorrhage regardless of age (P interaction >0.11 for all). Results were also consistent for the 13% of patients > 80 years. No significant interaction with apixaban dose was found with respect to treatment effect on major outcomes. CONCLUSION: The benefits of apixaban vs. warfarin were consistent in patients with AF regardless of age. Owing to the higher risk at older age, the absolute benefits of apixaban were greater in the elderly."

Interleukin-5 is a Th2 homodimeric cytokine involved in the differentiation, maturation, migration, development, survival, trafficking and effector function of blood and local tissue eosinophils, in addition to basophils and mast cells. The IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) consists of an IL-5-specific \u03b1 subunit that interacts in conformationally dynamic ways with the receptor's \u03b2c subunit, an aggregate of domains it shares with binding sites of IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IL-5 and IL-5R drive allergic and inflammatory immune responses characterizing numerous diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, hyper-eosinophilic syndrome, Churg-Strauss syndrome and eosinophilic nasal polyposis. Although corticosteroid therapy is the primary treatment for these diseases, a substantial number of patients exhibit incomplete responses and suffer side-effects. Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab). Both antibodies have demonstrated the ability to reduce blood and tissue eosinophil counts. One additional monoclonal antibody, benralizumab (MEDI-563), has been developed to target IL-5R and attenuate eosinophilia through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. All three monoclonal antibodies are being clinically evaluated. Antisense oligonucleotide technology targeting the common \u03b2c IL-5R subunit is also being used therapeutically to inhibit IL-5-mediated effects (TPI ASM8). Small interfering RNA technology has also been used therapeutically to inhibit the expression of IL-5 in animal models. This review summarizes the structural interactions between IL-5 and IL-5R and the functional consequences of such interactions, and describes the pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting IL-5R as a therapeutic target."

Here, we present a specifically designed web-accessible database, Super-Enhancer Archive (SEA, http://sea.edbc.org). SEA focuses on integrating super-enhancers in multiple species and annotating their potential roles in the regulation of cell identity gene expression. The current release of SEA incorporates 83 996 super-enhancers computationally or experimentally identified in 134 cell types/tissues/diseases, including human (75 439, three of which were experimentally identified), mouse (5879, five of which were experimentally identified), Drosophila melanogaster (1774) and Caenorhabditis elegans (904). To facilitate data extraction, SEA supports multiple search options, including species, genome location, gene name, cell type/tissue and super-enhancer name. The response provides detailed (epi)genetic information, incorporating cell type specificity, nearby genes, transcriptional factor binding sites, CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, evolutionary conservation, SNPs, H3K27ac, DNA methylation, gene expression and TF ChIP-seq data. Moreover, analytical tools and a genome browser were developed for users to explore super-enhancers and their roles in defining cell identity and disease processes in depth."

BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) is an inflammatory disorder caused by mutations in any of six genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR). The disease is severe and effective treatments are urgently needed. We investigated the status of interferon-related biomarkers in patients with AGS with a view to future use in diagnosis and clinical trials. METHODS: In this case-control study, samples were collected prospectively from patients with mutation-proven AGS. The expression of six interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by quantitative PCR, and the median fold change, when compared with the median of healthy controls, was used to create an interferon score for each patient. Scores higher than the mean of controls plus two SD (>2\u00b7466) were designated as positive. Additionally, we collated historical data for interferon activity, measured with a viral cytopathic assay, in CSF and serum from mutation-positive patients with AGS. We also undertook neutralisation assays of interferon activity in serum, and looked for the presence of autoantibodies against a panel of interferon proteins. FINDINGS: 74 (90%) of 82 patients had a positive interferon score (median 12\u00b790, IQR 6\u00b714-20\u00b741) compared with two (7%) of 29 controls (median 0\u00b793, IQR 0\u00b757-1\u00b730). Of the eight patients with a negative interferon score, seven had mutations in RNASEH2B (seven [27%] of all 26 patients with mutations in this gene). Repeat sampling in 16 patients was consistent for the presence or absence of an interferon signature on 39 of 41 occasions. Interferon activity (tested in 147 patients) was negatively correlated with age (CSF, r=-0\u00b7604; serum, r=-0\u00b7289), and was higher in CSF than in serum in 104 of 136 paired samples. Neutralisation assays suggested that measurable antiviral activity was related to interferon \u03b1 production. We did not record significantly increased concentrations of autoantibodies to interferon subtypes in patients with AGS, or an association between the presence of autoantibodies and interferon score or serum interferon activity. INTERPRETATION: AGS is consistently associated with an interferon signature, which is apparently sustained over time and can thus be used to differentiate patients with AGS from controls. If future studies show that interferon status is a reactive biomarker, the measurement of an interferon score might prove useful in the assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the onset of vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and the associated endolymphatic hydrops (EH) of the inner ear. DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation of three patient groups. SETTINGS: Disease-specific symptoms were reviewed among referred patients in a tertiary referral hospital in Finland and in members of a Finnish M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Association in Finland. The MRI of a separate group of patients was undertaken in a tertiary referral centre in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 340 patients were reviewed in the referral hospital along with 740 members of the M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Association. MRI was undertaken in 224 patients in Japan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Latency and symptom development in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and the appearance of EH of the inner ear in monosymptomatic patients and in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. RESULTS: The mean age of the first symptom was 43.8 years, with 10% of the patients being older than 65 years. The time delay between hearing loss and vertigo was more than 5 years in 20% of the members and of the patients. Gadolinium-contrasted MRI demonstrated EH in 90% of the patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, in which 75% was bilateral among patients with unilateral symptoms. In monosymptomatic patients with vertigo, tinnitus or hearing loss; EH was demonstrated in 55-90% of the patients either in the cochlea and/or the vestibulum of the symptomatic ear. CONCLUSIONS: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease often shows bilateral EH and comprises a continuum from a monosymptomatic disease to the typical symptom complex of the disease. We suggest that a 3T MRI measurement should be carried out in patients with sensory-neural hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus, 4 h after the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-contrast agent to verify the inner ear pathology. This may lead to a better management of the condition."

BACKGROUND: Although bacteremias caused by the 6 ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (SOT), more information is urgently needed. We sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in SOT and determine the risk factors for mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of bacteremia after SOT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE bacteremia were identified. RESULTS: Eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by ESKAPE strains. Of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms. The only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with ESKAPE was septic shock (odds ratio [OR] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.038-87.682, P < 0.001). The factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were septic shock (OR = 16.558, 95% CI = 6.620-104.668, P = 0.003) and age > 40 years (OR = 7.521, 95% CI = 1.196-47.292, P = 0.031).

The principles underpinning Islam's ethical framework applied to routine clinical scenarios remain insufficiently understood by many clinicians, thereby unfortunately permitting the delivery of culturally insensitive healthcare.This paper summarises the foundations of the Islamic ethical theory, elucidating the principles and methodology employed by the Muslim jurist in deriving rulings in the field of medical ethics. The four-principles approach, as espoused by Beauchamp and Childress, is also interpreted through the prism of Islamic ethical theory. Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm. This will provide an important insight into Islamic medical ethics, enabling the clinician to have a better informed discussion with the Muslim patient. It will also allow for a higher degree of concordance in consultations and consequently optimise culturally sensitive healthcare delivery."

Both DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications contribute to gene silencing, but the mechanistic relationship between these epigenetic marks is unclear. Mutations in two Arabidopsis genes, the KRYPTONITE (KYP) histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase and the CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) DNA methyltransferase, cause a reduction of CNG DNA methylation, suggesting that H3K9 methylation controls CNG DNA methylation. Here we show that the chromodomain of CMT3 can directly interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, but only when it is simultaneously methylated at both the H3K9 and H3K27 positions. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and immunohistolocalization experiments, we found that H3K27 methylation colocalizes with H3K9 methylation at CMT3-controlled loci. The H3K27 methylation present at heterochromatin was not affected by mutations in KYP or in several Arabidopsis PcG related genes including the Enhancer of Zeste homologs, suggesting that a novel pathway controls heterochromatic H3K27 methylation. Our results suggest a model in which H3K9 methylation by KYP, and H3K27 methylation by an unknown enzyme provide a combinatorial histone code for the recruitment of CMT3 to silent loci."

Following encouraging initial data from other centres we report our open label experience of using Campath 1-H as a treatment in aggressive relapsing multiple sclerosis in a consecutive series of 39 highly selected patients treated across three regional centres and followed for a mean of 1.89 years. The mean annualised relapse rate fell from 2.48 pre treatment to 0.19 post treatment with 29% of documented relapses observed in the 12 weeks following initial infusion. Mean change in EDSS was -0.36 overall and -0.15 in those patients completing > or =1 year of follow- up. Eighty-three per cent of patients had stable or improved disability following treatment. Infusion related side effects were common including rash, headache and pyrexia but were usually mild and self limiting. Transient worsening of pre-existing neurological deficits during infusion was observed in 3 patients. 12 patients developed biochemical evidence of autoimmune dysfunction, 2 patients developed thyroid disease and 1 patient autoimmune skin disease. We conclude that relapse rates fall following Campath 1-H. Whilst side effects were common these were normally self limiting or easily managed, suggesting Campath 1-H may be of use in the treatment of very active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis."

When rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) among other cytokines leaks into the subretinal space, induces resident retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to migrate, which is the initial step of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). In the current study, we aim to understand how this is regulated by focusing the cellular mechanisms involved. Here we identified an Akt/Tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2)/mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway after TNF-\u03b1 treatment to mediate RPE cell migration. Suppression of mTORC1 activation, either by its inhibitor rapamycin, or by activation of its suppressor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibited TNF-\u03b1-mediated RPE cell migration, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knocking-down of SIN1 or Rictor, two key components of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), had no significant effect on TNF-\u03b1-induced RPE cell migration. Our data provide initial evidence that TNF-\u03b1-mediated in vitro RPE cell migration mainly requires Akt/mTORC1, but not mTORC2 signaling. The results of this study may lead to indentify novel signaling targets against PVR."

Different responses, in terms both of efficacy and toxicity, are commonly observed for any drug administered to apparently homogeneous groups of patients. It is estimated that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) cause 3-6% of all hospitalizations, accounting for 5% to 9% of hospital admission costs. The skin is often involved in ADRs and although most cutaneous ADRs have a favorable course, they may present as severe adverse cutaneous drug reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (also referred to as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. SCARs are associated with significant mortality and require prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment. Pharmacogenetics studies individual variants in the DNA sequence associated with drug efficacy and toxicity, allowing prescription of a drug to patients expected to benefit from it, and excluding from treatment those who are at risk of developing ADRs. Pharmacogenetics already achieved several important results in the prevention of SCARs, and pharmacogenetic testing is now recommended by regulatory agencies before administration of abacavir and carbamazepine, leading to reduced incidence of SCARs. In this review, the pharmacogenetic associations of SCARs that have been validated in independent, case-control association studies will be presented. By familiarizing with principles of pharmacogenetics, dermatologists should be able to correlate specific cutaneous ADR phenotypes to the underlying genotype, thus contributing to better drug safety and facilitating drug discovery, development and approval."

Thyroid hormone (TH) responsive genes can be both positively and negatively regulated by TH through receptors (TR) alpha and beta expressed in most body tissues. However, their relative roles in the regulation of specific gene expression remain unknown. The TR beta knockout mouse, which lacks both TR beta1 and TR beta2 isoforms, provides a model to examine the role of these receptors in mediating TH action. TR beta deficient (TR beta-/-) mice that show no compensatory increase in TR alpha, and wild-type (TR beta+/+) mice of the same strain were deprived of TH by feeding them a low iodine diet containing propylthiouracil, and were then treated with supraphysiological doses of L-T3 (0.5, 5.5, and 25 microg/day/mouse). TH deprivation alone increased the serum cholesterol concentration by 25% in TR beta+/+ mice and reduced it paradoxically by 23% in TR beta-/- mice. TH deprivation reduced the serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) concentration by 31% in TR beta+/+ mice but showed no change in the TR beta-/- mice. Treatment with L-T3 (0.5 to 25 microg/mouse/day) caused a 57% decrease in serum cholesterol and a 231% increase in serum AP in the TR beta+/+ mice. The TR beta-/- mice were resistant to the L-T3 induced changes in serum cholesterol and showed increase in AP only with the highest L-T3 dose. Basal heart rate (HR) in TR beta-/- mice was higher than that of TR beta+/+ mice by 11%. HR and energy expenditure (EE) in both TR beta+/+ and TR beta-/- mice showed similar decreases (49 and 46%) and increases (49 and 41%) in response to TH deprivation and L-T3 treatment, respectively. The effect of TH on the accumulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) of TH regulated liver genes was also examined. TH deprivation down regulated spot 14 (S14) mRNA and showed no change in malic enzyme (ME) mRNA in both TR beta+/+ and TR beta-/- mice. In contrast treatment with L-T3 produced an increase in S14 and ME but no change in TR beta-/- mice. From these results, it can be concluded that regulation of HR and EE are independent of TR beta. With the exception of serum cholesterol concentration and liver ME mRNA accumulation, all other markers of TH action examined during TH deprivation exhibited the expected responses in the absence of TR beta. Thus, as previously shown for serum TSH, TR beta is not absolutely necessary for some changes typical of hypothyroidism to occur. In contrast, except for HR and EE, the full manifestation of TH-mediated action required the presence of TR beta."

OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanisms and clinical significance of adverse interactions between warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and discuss how these interactions can be avoided. DATA SOURCES: Previous studies of interactions between warfarin and NSAIDs or reports of adverse interactions were identified from a MEDLINE search (1976 to present) and from the reference lists of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were considered for inclusion in the review. Pertinent information was selected for discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: All NSAIDs can prolong bleeding time by inhibiting platelet function. High-dose aspirin has a direct hypoprothrombinemic effect. Phenylbutazone and its analogs enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin through a pharmacokinetic interaction by inhibiting the hepatic metabolism of warfarin. Mefenamic acid also enhances the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, but the mechanism is not known. The clinical relevance of protein binding displacement in the interaction between warfarin and NSAIDs has been overstated, although a significant one may be more likely in the presence of high concentrations of NSAIDs in patients with slow elimination of warfarin (e.g., those with severe heart failure or impaired liver function). NSAIDs can induce gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely to be more severe if warfarin is also given. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs is generally discouraged because of the increased risk of bleeding in these patients. In patients receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDs, phenylbutazone and its analogs, high-dose aspirin, mefenamic acid, excessive use of topical methyl salicylate, and NSAIDs that are associated with a higher risk of bleeding peptic ulcers should be avoided. Patients should be closely monitored for anticoagulant control and bleeding complications during the combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs."

The isolation and analysis of nucleated fetal cells (NFCs) from maternal blood may represent a new approach to noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. Although promising, these techniques require highly accurate separation of NFCs from nucleated cells of maternal origin; the two major problems limiting these techniques are the relative rarity of fetal cells in maternal blood and the need to establish their fetal origin. We now report a novel procedure that has allowed accurate separation of NFCs from maternal cells. The technique reported involves direct micromanipulator isolation of histochemically identified hemoglobin F-positive nucleated cells to obtain fetal nucleated red blood cells (FNRBCs) of high yield and purity. Using this technique, followed by cell-by-cell multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of purified FNRBCs, we were able to detect some of the most common human aneuploidies (including Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and trisomy 13) in 33 pregnant women referred for amniocentesis. The procedure used, which can be completed in <72 hrs, produced complete concordance with the results of amniocentesis. We also confirm findings of prior studies suggesting that the number of FNRBCs in maternal circulation is remarkably higher in abnormal pregnancies than in normal pregnancies, especially in women carrying a fetus with trisomy 21."

BACKGROUND: Comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with poor outcomes among patients with cardiovascular disease. The risks of stroke and mortality associated with COPD among patients with atrial fibrillation are not well understood. METHODS: We analyzed patients from ARISTOTLE, a randomized trial of 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation comparing the effects of apixaban versus warfarin on the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed the associations between comorbid COPD and risk of stroke or systemic embolism and of mortality, adjusting for treatment allocation, smoking history and other risk factors. RESULTS: COPD was present in 1950 (10.8%) of 18,134 patients with data on pulmonary disease history. After multivariable adjustment, COPD was not associated with risk of stroke or systemic embolism (adjusted HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.60, 1.21], p=0.356). However, COPD was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.60 [95% CI 1.36, 1.88], p<0.001) and both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. The benefit of apixaban over warfarin on stroke or systemic embolism was consistent among patients with and without COPD (HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.52, 1.63] versus 0.78 [95% CI 0.65, 0.95], interaction p=0.617). CONCLUSIONS: COPD was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality among patients with atrial fibrillation, but was not associated with risk of stroke or systemic embolism. The effect of apixaban on stroke or systemic embolism in COPD patients was consistent with its effect in the overall trial population."

Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like flushing.

We present JASPAR CORE--an expanded version of the original, non-redundant collection of annotated, high-quality matrix-based transcription factor binding profiles, JASPAR FAM--a collection of familial TFBS models and JASPAR phyloFACTS--a set of matrices computationally derived from statistically overrepresented, evolutionarily conserved regulatory region motifs from mammalian genomes. JASPAR phyloFACTS serves as a non-redundant extension to JASPAR CORE, enhancing the overall breadth of JASPAR for promoter sequence analysis. The new release of JASPAR is available at http://jaspar.genereg.net."

          "context": "Staurosporine augments EGF-mediated EMT in PMC42-LA cells through actin depolymerisation, focal contact size reduction and Snail1 induction - a model for cross-modulation. BACKGROUND: A feature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) relevant to tumour dissemination is the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton/focal contacts, influencing cellular ECM adherence and motility. This is coupled with the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, often mediated by Snail1, Snail2 and Zeb1/deltaEF1. These genes, overexpressed in breast carcinomas, are known targets of growth factor-initiated pathways, however it is less clear how alterations in ECM attachment cross-modulate to regulate these pathways. EGF induces EMT in the breast cancer cell line PMC42-LA and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (ST) induces EMT in embryonic neural epithelial cells, with F-actin de-bundling and disruption of cell-cell adhesion, via inhibition of aPKC. METHODS: PMC42-LA cells were treated for 72 h with 10 ng/ml EGF, 40 nM ST, or both, and assessed for expression of E-cadherin repressor genes (Snail1, Snail2, Zeb1/deltaEF1) and EMT-related genes by QRT-PCR, multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) and immunofluorescence +/- cycloheximide. Actin and focal contacts (paxillin) were visualized by confocal microscopy. A public database of human breast cancers was assessed for expression of Snail1 and Snail2 in relation to outcome. RESULTS: When PMC42-LA were treated with EGF, Snail2 was the principal E-cadherin repressor induced. With ST or ST+EGF this shifted to Snail1, with more extreme EMT and Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction seen with ST+EGF. ST reduced stress fibres and focal contact size rapidly and independently of gene transcription. Gene expression analysis by MT-PCR indicated that ST repressed many genes which were induced by EGF (EGFR, CAV1, CTGF, CYR61, CD44, S100A4) and induced genes which alter the actin cytoskeleton (NLF1, NLF2, EPHB4). Examination of the public database of breast cancers revealed tumours exhibiting higher Snail1 expression have an increased risk of disease-recurrence. This was not seen for Snail2, and Zeb1/deltaEF1 showed a reverse correlation with lower expression values being predictive of increased risk. CONCLUSION: ST in combination with EGF directed a greater EMT via actin depolymerisation and focal contact size reduction, resulting in a loosening of cell-ECM attachment along with Snail1-Zeb1/deltaEF1 induction. This appeared fundamentally different to the EGF-induced EMT, highlighting the multiple pathways which can regulate EMT. Our findings add support for a functional role for Snail1 in invasive breast cancer."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of the FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score (ranging from 0 to 16), a new coma scale consisting of 4 components (eye response, motor response, brainstem reflexes, and respiration pattern), when used by the staff members of a medical intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This interobserver agreement study prospectively evaluated the use of the FOUR score to describe the condition of 100 critically ill patients from May 1, 2007, to April 30, 2008. We compared the FOUR score to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. For each patient, the FOUR score and the GCS score were determined by a randomly selected staff pair (nurse/fellow, nurse/consultant, fellow/fellow, or fellow/consultant). Pair wise weighted kappa values were calculated for both scores for each observer pair. RESULTS: The interrater agreement with the FOUR score was excellent (weighted kappa: eye response, 0.96; motor response, 0.97; brainstem reflex, 0.98; respiration pattern, 1.00) and similar to that obtained with the GCS (weighted kappa: eye response, 0.96; motor response, 0.97; verbal response, 0.98). In terms of the predictive power for poor neurologic outcome (Modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.75 for the FOUR score and 0.76 for the GCS score. The mortality rate for patients with the lowest FOUR score of 0 (89%) was higher than that for patients with the lowest GCS score of 3 (71%). CONCLUSION: The interrater agreement of FOUR score results was excellent among medical intensivists. In contrast to the GCS, all components of the FOUR score can be rated even when patients have undergone intubation. The FOUR score is a good predictor of the prognosis of critically ill patients and has important advantages over the GCS in the ICU setting."

OBJECTIVE: To review available studies of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved in 2014 by the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched using the search terms empagliflozin, BI 10773, and BI10773, for entries between January 1, 2000, and December 1, 2014. Reference lists from retrieved articles were searched manually for additional peer-reviewed publications. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All publications reporting clinical trials of empagliflozin were eligible for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Empagliflozin is a new once-daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor with a mechanism of action that is independent of \u03b2-cell function and the insulin pathway. Data from a comprehensive phase III clinical trial program have demonstrated its efficacy as monotherapy, as add-on to other glucose-lowering agents, and in different patient populations. In these studies, empagliflozin resulted in improvements in blood glucose levels as well as reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Empagliflozin was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo. CONCLUSION: The oral antidiabetes agent, empagliflozin, can be used as monotherapy or alongside other glucose-lowering treatments, including insulin, to treat T2DM."

Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) frequently produce autoantibodies against gp210, an integral glycoprotein of the nuclear pores. this protein consists of three main domains: a large glycosylated lumenal domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a short cytoplasmic tail. It has been previously shown that autoantibodies from PBC patients exclusively react with the cytoplasmic tail when recombinant rat gp210 expressed in Escherichia coli was used as antigen. Using human gp210 isolated from HeLa cells we found the lumenal domain as the major target. The aim of this study was to further characterize the dominant autoepitopes of gp210. Sera from 88 patients with autoimmune liver disease and 20 controls were used. Gp210 protein was digested with papain or endoglycosidase H and then subjected to immunoblotting. Autoantibodies against gp210 were detected in 12 of 43 (28%) PBC patients, but in none of the autoimmune hepatitis and control sera. Four of 12 (33%) anti-gp210 positive sera reacted with a fragment consisting of the cytoplasmic tail and 8 (66%) sera targeted an epitope located within the large lumenal domain. Furthermore, our data show that antigenic determinant is restricted to the 64 kD glycosylated amino-terminal fragment and that carbohydrate residues are an essential part of this novel epitope. We suggest that antigens possessing both epitopes namely; the glycosylated lumenal domain and the cytoplasmic tail should be used for screening tests in order to detect all sera with anti-gp210 specificity."

Recessive mutations in KCNJ10, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, were recently identified as the cause of EAST syndrome, a severe and disabling multi-organ disorder consisting of epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness and tubulopathy that becomes clinically apparent with seizures in infancy. A Kcnj10 knockout mouse shows postnatal mortality and is therefore not suitable for drug discovery. Because zebrafish are ideal for in vivo screening for potential therapeutics, we tested whether kcnj10 knockdown in zebrafish would fill this need. We cloned zebrafish kcnj10 and demonstrated that its function is equivalent to that of human KCNJ10. We next injected splice- and translation-blocking kcnj10 antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and reproduced the cardinal symptoms of EAST syndrome - ataxia, epilepsy and renal tubular defects. Several of these phenotypes could be assayed in an automated manner. We could rescue the morphant phenotype with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding human wild-type KCNJ10, but not with cRNA encoding a KCNJ10 mutation identified in individuals with EAST syndrome. Our results suggest that zebrafish will be a valuable tool to screen for compounds that are potentially therapeutic for EAST syndrome or its individual symptoms. Knockdown of kcnj10 represents the first zebrafish model of a salt-losing tubulopathy, which has relevance for blood pressure control."

Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. We also show that subsets of GATA-1 gene targets are bound in vivo by distinct complexes, thus linking specific GATA-1 partners to distinct aspects of its functions. Based on these findings, we suggest a model for the different roles of GATA-1 in erythroid differentiation."

Both SREBP-1c and ChREBP are target genes of liver X receptors (LXRs). Because LXRs and TH receptors (TRs) cross talk mutually in many aspects of transcription, we examined whether TRs regulate the mouse ChREBP gene expression. In the current study, we demonstrated that TH up-regulated mouse ChREBP mRNA and protein expression in liver. Run-on and luciferase assays showed that TH and TR-beta1 positively regulated the ChREBP gene transcription. The mouse ChREBP gene promoter contains two direct repeat-4 sites (LXRE1 and LXRE2) and EMSAs demonstrated that LXR-alpha and TR-beta1 prefer to bind LXRE1 and LXRE2, respectively. The direct repeat-4 deletion and LXRE2 mutants of the promoter deteriorate the positive regulation by TR-beta1, indicating that LXRE2 is functionally important for the regulation. We also showed that human ChREBP gene expression and promoter activities were up-regulated by TH. These data suggest that ChREBP mRNA expression is positively regulated by TR-beta1 and TH at the transcriptional level in mammals. This novel observation indicates that TH fine-tunes hepatic lipogenesis via regulating SREBP-1c and ChREBP gene expression reciprocally."

Therefore, we compared the 24-hr expression levels of key circadian clock genes in liver and kidney of healthy control mice with those of mice bearing C26 colorectal tumor metastases in the liver. Metastases were induced by injection of C26 colorectal carcinoma cells into the spleen. Subsequently, tumor, liver and kidney tissue was collected around the clock to compare circadian rhythmicity. Expression levels of five clock genes (Rev-Erb\u03b1, Per1, Per2, Bmal1 and Cry1) and three clock-controlled genes (CCGs; Dbp, p21 and Wee1) were determined by qRT-PCR. Liver and kidney tissue of healthy control mice showed normal 24-hr oscillations of all clock genes and CCGs, consistent with normal circadian rhythmicity. In colorectal liver metastases, however, 24-hr oscillations were completely absent for all clock genes and CCGs except Cry1. Liver and kidney tissue of tumor-bearing mice showed a shift in clock periodicity relative to control mice. In the liver we observed a phase advance, whereas in the kidney the phase was delayed. These data show that hepatic metastases of C26 colon carcinoma with a disrupted circadian rhythm phase shift liver and kidney tissue clocks, which strongly suggests a systemic effect on peripheral clocks. The possibility that tumors may modify peripheral clocks to escape from ordinary circadian rhythms and in this way contribute to fatigue and sleep disorders in cancer patients is discussed."

We validated upregulation of PTCH, a membrane receptor in the Hh signaling pathway, in a subgroup of DIPG specimens. DNA methylation analysis indicated global hypomethylation of DIPG compared to adjacent normal tissue specimens, with differential methylation of 24 genes involved in Hh and Myc pathways, correlating with protein and mRNA expression patterns. Sequencing analysis showed c.83A>T mutations in the H3F3A or HIST1H3B gene in 77\u00a0% of our DIPG cohort. Supervised analysis revealed a unique methylation pattern in mutated specimens compared to the wild-type DIPG samples. This study presents the first comprehensive multidimensional protein, mRNA, and methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumor specimens, detecting the presence of two subgroups within our DIPG cohort. This multidimensional analysis of DIPG provides increased analytical power to more fully explore molecular signatures of DIPGs, with implications for evaluating potential molecular subtypes and biomarker discovery for assessing response to therapy."

The presence of 5-azacytosine (ZCyt) residues in DNA leads to potent inhibition of DNA (cytosine-C5) methyltranferases (C5-MTases) in vivo and in vitro. Enzymatic methylation of cytosine in mammalian DNA is an epigenetic modification that can alter gene activity and chromosomal stability, influencing both differentiation and tumorigenesis. Thus, it is important to understand the critical mechanistic determinants of ZCyt's inhibitory action. Although several DNA C5-MTases have been reported to undergo essentially irreversible binding to ZCyt in DNA, there is little agreement as to the role of AdoMet and/or methyl transfer in stabilizing enzyme interactions with ZCyt. Our results demonstrate that formation of stable complexes between HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI) and oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing ZCyt at the target position for methylation (ZCyt-ODNs) occurs in both the absence and presence of co-factors, AdoMet and AdoHcy. Both binary and ternary complexes survive SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and take on a compact conformation that increases their electrophoretic mobility in comparison to free M.HhaI. Since methyl transfer can occur only in the presence of AdoMet, these results suggest (1) that the inhibitory capacity of ZCyt in DNA is based on its ability to induce a stable, tightly closed conformation of M.HhaI that prevents DNA and co-factor release and (2) that methylation of ZCyt in DNA is not required for inhibition of M.HhaI."

Human pathogenic neurotoxins of types A, B, E, and F are produced by a diverse group of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium botulinum groups I and II, Clostridium butyricum, and Clostridium baratii. The routine laboratory diagnostics of botulism is based on the detection of botulinum neurotoxin in the patient. Detection of toxin-producing clostridia in the patient and/or the vehicle confirms the diagnosis. The neurotoxin detection is based on the mouse lethality assay. Sensitive and rapid in vitro assays have been developed, but they have not yet been appropriately validated on clinical and food matrices. Culture methods for C. botulinum are poorly developed, and efficient isolation and identification tools are lacking. Molecular techniques targeted to the neurotoxin genes are ideal for the detection and identification of C. botulinum, but they do not detect biologically active neurotoxin and should not be used alone. Apart from rapid diagnosis, the laboratory diagnostics of botulism should aim at increasing our understanding of the epidemiology and prevention of the disease. Therefore, the toxin-producing organisms should be routinely isolated from the patient and the vehicle. The physiological group and genetic traits of the isolates should be determined."

PURPOSE: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a developmental disorder caused by a failure of neural crest cells to migrate, proliferate, and/or differentiate during the enteric nervous system development. It presents a multifactorial, nonmendelian pattern of inheritance, with several genes playing some role in its pathogenesis. Its major susceptibility gene is the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase activating several key signaling pathways in the enteric nervous system development. Given the pivotal role of RET in HSCR, the genes encoding their ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN) are also good candidates for the disease. METHODS: We have performed a case-control study using Taqman technology to evaluate 10 polymorphisms within these genes, as well as haplotypes comprising them, as susceptibility factors for HSCR. RESULTS: No differences were found in the allelic frequencies of the variants or in the haplotype distribution between patients and controls. In addition, no particular association was detected of the variants/haplotypes to any demographic/clinical parameters within the group of patients. CONCLUSION: These data would be consistent with the lack of association between these polymorphisms and HSCR, although they do not permit to completely discard a possible role of other variants within these genes in the disease. Moreover, because the gene-by-gene approach does not take into account the polygenic nature of HSCR disease, it would be interesting to investigate sets of variants in many other different susceptibility loci described for HSCR, which may permit to consider possible interactions among susceptibility genes."

A highly methylated on internal cytosine residue CCGG site was found 1.5 kb upstream of the gene, whereas CCGG sites located in more proximal parts of the 5'-flanking region and the gene itself are essentially unmethylated. This methylation pattern was observed in different organs of plants belonging to two different ecotypes as well as in different transgenic plant lines. The methylation level ofa CCGG site in exon 3 (2.1 kb from the gene's 5'-end) occurred to be variable between different transgenic plant lines and two ecotypes studied. Transcription levels of the MET1 gene vary slightly in organs of wild-type plants without any obvious correlation with its methylation. The transgenic antisense MET1 constructs expressed in plant genome do affect both MET1 methylation and its transcription but again without any obvious correlation. The comparative investigation of transcription levels of different genes of cytosine DNA methyltransferase family MET (MET1, MET2a, MET2b, MET3) and their methylation patterns shows that there may exist some mechanisms defending the most actively transcribed gene MET1 of this family from methylation mediated silencing. In contrast to DRM2 gene we could not find any adenine methylated GATC sites in the MET1 gene."

Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that Mcidas and GemC1 are sufficient and necessary for cell fate commitment and differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated ependymal cells. Furthermore, we show that GemC1 and Mcidas operate in hierarchical order, upstream of Foxj1 and c-Myb transcription factors, which are known regulators of ependymal cell generation, and that Notch signaling inhibits GemC1 and Mcidas function.

The glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptors alpha (GFRalpha) are cell surface bound glycoproteins that mediate interactions of the GDNF ligand family with the RET receptor. These interactions are crucial to the development of the kidney and some peripheral nerve lineages. In humans, mutations of RET or RET ligands are associated with the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) in which nerves and ganglia of the hind gut are absent. As the GFRalpha family are required for normal activation of the RET receptor, they are also candidates for a role in HSCR. The GFRA2 gene, which is required for the development of the myenteric nerve plexus, is an excellent candidate gene for HSCR. In this study, we cloned the human GFRA2 locus, characterized the gene structure, and compared it with other GFRA family members. We further investigated the GFRA2 gene for mutations in a panel of HSCR patients. GFRA2 has nine coding exons that are similar in size and organization to those of other GFRA family genes. We identified six sequence variants of GFRA2, four of which did not affect the amino acid sequence of the GFRalpha-2 protein. Two further changes that resulted in amino acid substitutions were found in exon 9 and were predicted to lie in the amino acid sequence encoding the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linkage signal of GFRalpha-2. There was no difference in frequency of any of the sequence variants between control and HSCR populations. Our data indicate that members of the GFRA gene family are closely related in intron/exon structure and in sequence. We have not detected any correlation between sequence variants of GFRA2 and the HSCR phenotype."

The H3K9me3 histone modification is often found at promoter regions, where it functions to repress transcription. However, we have previously shown that 3' exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3' exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a SNP analysis of RNA-seq data to demonstrate that both alleles of certain ZNF genes having H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 are transcribed. We next analyzed isolated ZNF 3' exons using stably integrated episomes. We found that although the H3K36me3 mark was lost when the 3' ZNF exon was removed from its natural genomic location, the isolated ZNF 3' exons retained the H3K9me3 mark. Thus, the H3K9me3 mark at ZNF 3' exons does not impede transcription and it is regulated independently of the H3K36me3 mark. Finally, we demonstrate a strong relationship between the number of tandemly repeated domains in the 3' exons and the H3K9me3 mark. We suggest that the H3K9me3 at ZNF 3' exons may function to protect the genome from inappropriate recombination rather than to regulate transcription."

Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus."

They promote extravasation of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis via interacting with E-selectin on endothelial cells. Recently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been noted as a critical phenotypic alteration in metastatic cancer cells. To address the association between sLe(x/a) expression and EMT, we assessed whether sLe(x/a) are highly expressed on colon cancer cells undergoing EMT. Treatment of HT29 and DLD-1 cells with EGF and/or basic FGF (bFGF) induced EMT and significantly increased sLe(x/a) expression resulting in enhanced E-selectin binding activity. The transcript levels of the glycosyltransferase genes ST3GAL1/3/4 and FUT3 were significantly elevated and that of FUT2 was significantly suppressed by the treatment. We provide evidence that ST3GAL1/3/4 and FUT3 are transcriptionally up-regulated by c-Myc with probable involvement of Ser62 phosphorylation, and that FUT2 is transcriptionally down-regulated through the attenuation of CDX2. The contribution of c-Myc and CDX2 to the sLe(x/a) induction was proved to be significant by knockdown or forced expression experiments. Interestingly, the cells undergoing EMT exhibited significantly increased VEGF secretion, which can promote tumor angiogenesis in cooperation with sLe(x/a). Finally, immunohistological study indicated high E-selectin ligand expression on cancer cells undergoing EMT in vivo, supporting their coexistence observed in vitro. These results suggest a significant link between sLe(x/a) expression and EMT in colon cancer cells and a pivotal role of c-Myc and CDX2 in regulating sLe(x/a) expression during EMT."

Modern humans have occupied almost all possible environments globally since exiting Africa about 100,000 years ago. Both behavioral and biological adaptations have contributed to their success in surviving the rigors of climatic extremes, including cold, strong ultraviolet radiation, and high altitude. Among these environmental stresses, high-altitude hypoxia is the only condition in which traditional technology is incapable of mediating its effects. Inhabiting at >3,000-m high plateau, the Tibetan population provides a widely studied example of high-altitude adaptation. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underpinning long-term survival in this environmental extreme remain unknown. We performed an analysis of genome-wide sequence variations in Tibetans. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. For these two genes, Tibetans show unusually high divergence from the non-Tibetan lowlanders (Han Chinese and Japanese) and possess high frequencies of many linked sequence variations as reflected by the Tibetan-specific haplotypes. Further analysis in seven Tibetan populations (1,334 individuals) indicates the prevalence of selective sweep across the Himalayan region. The observed indicators of natural selection on EPAS1 and EGLN1 suggest that during the long-term occupation of high-altitude areas, the functional sequence variations for acquiring biological adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia have been enriched in Tibetan populations."

The highly phosphorylated STAT3 in cancer cells contributes to numerous physiological and oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, a significant association between STAT3 signaling and glioblastoma multiforme stem-like cell (GBM-SC) development and maintenance has been demonstrated in recent studies. Previously, we reported a novel small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 dimerization, STX-0119, as a cancer therapeutic. In the present study, we focused on cancer stem-like cells derived from recurrent GBM patients and investigated the efficacy of STX-0119. Three GBM stem cell lines showed many stem cell markers such as CD133, EGFR, Nanog, Olig2, nestin and Yamanaka factors (c-myc, KLF4, Oct3/4 and SOX2) compared with parental cell lines. These cell lines also formed tumors in vivo and had similar histological to surgically resected tumors. STAT3 phosphorylation was activated more in the GBM-SC lines than serum-derived GB cell lines. The growth inhibitory effect of STX-0119 on GBM-SCs was moderate (IC50 15-44 \u00b5M) and stronger compared to that of WP1066 in two cell lines. On the other hand, the effect of temozolomide was weak in all the cell lines (IC50 53-226 \u00b5M). Notably, STX-0119 demonstrated strong inhibition of the expression of STAT3 target genes (c-myc, survivin, cyclin D1, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF) and stem cell-associated genes (CD44, Nanog, nestin and CD133) as well as the induction of apoptosis in one stem-like cell line. Interestingly, VEGFR2 mRNA was also remarkably inhibited by STX-0119. In a model using transplantable stem-like cell lines in vivo GB-SCC010 and 026, STX-0119 inhibited the growth of GBM-SCs at 80 mg/kg. STX-0119, an inhibitor of STAT3, may serve as a novel therapeutic compound against GBM-SCs even in temozolomide-resistant GBM patients and has the potential for GBM-SC-specific therapeutics in combination with temozolomide plus radiation therapy."

The Drosophila dishevelled gene (dsh) encodes a secreted glycoprotein, which regulates cell proliferation, acting as a transducer molecule for developmental processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones from two different human dsh-homologous genes, designated as DVL-1 and DVL-3. DVL-1 and DVL-3 putative protein products show 64% amino acid identity. The DVL-1 product is 50% identical to dsh and 92% to a murine dsh homologue (Dvl-1). Both human DVL genes are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues, including brain, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and heart. DVL-1 locus maps to chromosome 1p36 and DVL-3 to chromosome 3q27. DVL-1 locus on chromosome 1 corresponds to the murine syntenic region where Dvl-1 is located. DVL-1 and DVL-3 are members of a human dsh-like gene family, which is probably involved in human development. Although the precise role of these genes in embryogenesis is only conjectural at present, the structural and evolutionary characteristics suggest that mutations at their loci may be involved in neural and heart developmental defects."

Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones. The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. Northern blot analysis indicates that junctate is expressed in a variety of human tissues including heart, pancreas, brain, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the genetic loci of junctin and junctate map to the same cytogenetic band on human chromosome 8. Analysis of intron/exon boundaries of the genomic BAC clones demonstrate that junctin, junctate, and aspartyl beta-hydroxylase result from alternative splicing of the same gene. The predicted lumenal portion of junctate is enriched in negatively charged residues and is able to bind calcium. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium (45)Ca(2+) binding in the presence of a physiological concentration of KCl demonstrate that junctate binds 21.0 mol of Ca(2+)/mol protein with a k(D) of 217 +/- 20 microm (n = 5). Tagging recombinant junctate with green fluorescent protein and expressing the chimeric polypeptide in COS-7-transfected cells indicates that junctate is located in endoplasmic reticulum membranes and that its presence increases the peak amplitude and transient calcium released by activation of surface membrane receptors coupled to InsP(3) receptor activation. Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate)."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency, risk factors, clinical features, and management of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunctions. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Patients who had been prescribed amiodarone for at least 6 months from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2007. RESULTS: A total of 390 patients (mean age, 70 years; standard deviation, 9 years; 54% male) with a median follow-up of 43 (interquartile range, 25-69) months were studied. Hypothyroidism developed in 87 (22%) of the patients (mean age, 72 years; standard deviation, 7 years; 56% male) and thyrotoxicosis in 24 (6%) of the patients (65 years; 11 years; 54% male). Increased baseline thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level appeared to be predictive of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, in which a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 mIU/L or above was associated with a 4.7-fold increase in the risk (95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7; P<0.001). Compared with those who remained euthyroid on amiodarone, thyrotoxicosis developed in younger patients. In these patients, the classical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction were frequently absent, although worsening of underlying arrhythmias, their cardiac condition, weight loss, and over-warfarinisation were suggestive of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. In both amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, the disease course was benign. Patients with the former showed a good response to anti-thyroid drugs and steroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction is common among our population. As the clinical presentations are usually vague and atypical, regular biochemical monitoring of thyroid function is warranted, particularly in patients with elevated baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone level. The disease course of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is usually benign and remits with timely administration of anti-thyroid medications, with or without corticosteroids."

OBJECTIVES: Let-7 is a family of small non-coding RNAs regulating the expression of many genes that control important cellular activities. Let-7 is shown in vitro to sensitize cancer cells to platinum, but induce ovarian cancer resistance to paclitaxel. This study aims to investigate the effect of let-7a expression on survival outcomes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients treated with different chemotherapy. METHODS: Let-7a expression was measured with qRT-PCR in ovarian tumors of 178 EOC patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy with and without paclitaxel after surgery. Survival analysis was performed to assess the effects of let-7a and chemotherapy on disease outcomes. RESULTS: Let-7a expression was detectable in the EOC samples, but the expression was not associated with disease stage, tumor grade, histology and debulking results. Patients who responded to platinum with paclitaxel had significantly lower let-7a than those who did not. Survival analyses showed that patients with high let-7a had better survival compared to those with low let-7a when they were treated with platinum without paclitaxel. The hazards ratios (HRs) for death and disease progression were 0.52 (95% CI: 0.29-0.96) and 0.48 (0.26-0.89) for high let-7a when compared to low let-7a, respectively. However, when patients were treated with platinum and paclitaxel, high let-7a was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival. The HRs for death and disease progression were 3.87 (95% CI: 1.28-11.66) and 3.48 (95% CI: 1.25-9.67) for high let-7a when compared to low let-7a, respectively. Further studies showed that among patients with low let-7a, those treated with paclitaxel in addition to platinum survived better than those treated without paclitaxel [adjusted-HRs were 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15-0.66) for death and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22-0.75) for disease], while among those with high let-7a, the two types of treatment made no difference in patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the beneficial impact of the addition of paclitaxel on EOC survival was significantly linked to let-7a levels, and that miRNAs such as let-7a may be a useful marker for selection of chemotherapeutic agents in EOC management."

The expression levels of thousands of genes are affected in Ewing sarcoma, however, it is unknown which of these genes contribute to the transformed phenotype. Here we characterize BCL11B as an up-regulated EWS/FLI target that is necessary for the maintenance of transformation in patient derived Ewing sarcoma cells lines. BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing's sarcoma and contributes to the EWS/FLI repressed gene signature. BCL11B repressive activity is mediated by the NuRD co-repressor complex. We further demonstrate that re-expression of SPRY1, a repressed target of BCL11B, limits the transformation capacity of Ewing sarcoma cells. These data define a new pathway downstream of EWS/FLI required for oncogenic maintenance in Ewing sarcoma."

UNLABELLED: Triple A syndrome (alacrima, achalasia, adrenal failure, progressive neurodegenerative disease) is caused by mutations in the AAAS gene which encodes the protein alacrima achalasia adrenal insufficiency neurologic disorder (ALADIN). Our investigation suggests that low bone mineral density (BMD) for age/osteoporosis could be a common but overlooked symptom of unexplained etiology in this rare multisystemic disease. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to evaluate incidence and etiology of BMD for age/osteoporosis, a possibly overlooked symptom in triple A syndrome. METHODS: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, and radius, bone turnover markers, minerals, total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-OH2D), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione) were measured in five male and four female patients. RESULTS: At time of diagnosis, low BMD for age was suspected on X-ray in seven of nine patients aged 2-11\u00a0years (not performed in two patients); normal levels of minerals and ALP were found in nine patients and low levels of adrenal androgens in eight patients (not measured in one patient). Reevaluation 5-35\u00a0years after introduction of 12\u00a0mg/m(2)/day hydrocortisone showed low BMD for age in two children, osteopenia in one, and osteoporosis in six adults. Normal levels of minerals, ALP, PTH, 1,25-OH2D, procollagen type 1, crosslaps, and osteocalcin were found in all patients. Low levels of adrenal androgens were found in all and 25OHD deficiency in six patients. Body mass index was <25\u00a0% for age and sex in eight of nine patients. CONCLUSION: Low BMD for age/osteoporosis in our patients probably is not a result of glucocorticoid therapy but could be the consequence of low level of adrenal androgens, neurological impairment causing physical inactivity, inadequate sun exposure, and protein malnutrition secondary to achalasia. Considering ubiquitous ALADIN expression, low BMD/osteoporosis may be a primary phenotypic feature of the disease. Besides optimizing glucocorticoid dose, physical activity, adequate sun exposure, appropriate nutrition, and vitamin D supplementation, therapy with DHEA should be considered."

METHODS: In a multicentre, randomised, phase II study, stage IV melanoma patients were randomised 1:1:1:1 to 1000 mg m(-2) dacarbazine+placebo (n=32), 1000 mg m(-2) dacarbazine+10 mg kg(-1) intetumumab (n=32), 10 mg kg(-1) intetumumab (n=33), or 5 mg kg(-1) intetumumab (n=32) q3w. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), adverse events, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in efficacy were observed between groups. In the dacarbazine+placebo, dacarbazine+intetumumab, 10 mg kg(-1) intetumumab, and 5 mg kg(-1) intetumumab groups, median PFS was 1.8, 2.5, 1.4, and 1.4 months; median OS was 8, 11, 15, and 9.8 months; and ORR of complete+partial response was 10, 3, 6, and 0%. Nonlinear intetumumab pharmacokinetics and potential intetumumab-dacarbazine interactions were observed. Transient, asymptomatic, nonrecurring, grade 1-2, uveitic reactions that resolved spontaneously or with topical steroids were seen in 22-30% of intetumumab-treated patients. Low-grade infusion-reaction symptoms (headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills) were observed, as expected, in 16-73% of dacarbazine-treated patients. No intetumumab-related myelosuppression, laboratory/electrocardiogram abnormalities, or deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: With its favourable safety profile and a nonsignificant trend towards improved OS, intetumumab merits further investigation in advanced melanoma."

EGFR regulates Yorkie through the influence of its Ras-MAPK branch on the Ajuba LIM protein Jub. Jub is epistatic to EGFR and Ras for Yorkie regulation, Jub is subject to MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, and EGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling enhances Jub binding to the Yorkie kinase Warts and the adaptor protein Salvador. An EGFR-Hippo pathway link is conserved in mammals, as activation of EGFR or RAS activates the Yorkie homolog YAP, and EGFR-RAS-MAPK signaling promotes phosphorylation of the Ajuba family protein WTIP and also enhances WTIP binding to the Warts and Salvador homologs LATS and WW45. Our observations implicate the Hippo pathway in EGFR-mediated tumorigenesis and identify a molecular link between these pathways."

The goal of this study was to apply the new transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) technology to perform noninvasive central lateral thalamotomies (CLTs) as a treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. METHODS: In 12 patients suffering from chronic therapy-resistant neuropathic pain, tcMRgFUS CLT was proposed. In 11 patients, precisely localized thermal ablations of 3-4 mm in diameter were produced in the posterior part of the central lateral thalamic nucleus at peak temperatures between 51 \u00b0 C and 64 \u00b0 C with the aid of real-time patient monitoring and MR imaging and MR thermometry guidance.

RESULTS: Patients experienced mean pain relief of 49% at the 3-month follow-up (9 patients) and 57% at the 1-year follow-up (8 patients). Mean improvement according to the visual analog scale amounted to 42% at 3 months and 41% at 1 year. Six patients experienced immediate and persisting somatosensory improvements. Somatosensory and vestibular clinical manifestations were always observed during sonication time because of ultrasound-based neuronal activation and/or initial therapeutic effects. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) showed a significant reduction in EEG spectral overactivities. Thermal ablation sites showed sharply delineated ellipsoidal thermolesions surrounded by short-lived vasogenic edema. Lesion reconstructions (18 lesions in 9 patients) demonstrated targeting precision within a millimeter for all 3 coordinates. There was 1 complication, a bleed in the target with ischemia in the motor thalamus, which led to the introduction of 2 safety measures, that is, the detection of a potential cavitation by a cavitation detector and the maintenance of sonication temperatures below 60 \u00b0 C. CONCLUSIONS: The authors assert that tcMRgFUS represents a noninvasive, precise, and radiation-free neurosurgical technique for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The procedure avoids mechanical brain tissue shift and eliminates the risk of infection. The possibility of applying sonication thermal spots free from trajectory restrictions should allow one to optimize target coverage. The real-time continuous MR imaging and MR thermometry monitoring of targeting accuracy and thermal effects are major factors in optimizing precision, safety, and efficacy in an outpatient context."

Coumarin derivatives combine 3 unfavorable properties which make them prone to potentially life threatening drug-drug interactions: (i) high protein binding; (ii) cytochrome P450 dependent metabolism; and (iii) a narrow therapeutic range. An entire list of drugs which are supposed to interact with coumarins (mostly with warfarin) comprises about 250 different compounds. Noteworthy are the interactions with cardiovascular or antilipidaemic drugs which are often coadministered with coumarins: amiodarone, propafenone and fibrates. Cardiovascular drugs which are obviously devoid or proven to be devoid of an interaction are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers and cardiac glycosides. There are several other drugs which enhance the hypoprothrombinaemic response to coumarins by various mechanisms: inhibitors of the elimination of the eutomer S-(-)-warfarin (e.g. miconazole, phenylbutazone), combined with protein binding displacement (e.g., sulfinpyrazone, phenylbutazone), synergistic hypoprothrombinaemia (e.g. cefazoline). Furthermore, bleeding complications may occur with drugs affecting platelet function [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Strong inducers of coumarin metabolism are rifampicin (rifampin) and carbamazepine. Biphasic interactions may occur where a drug first enhances the hypoprothrombinaemic response to a coumarin but has a sustained inducing effect on coumarin metabolism (e.g. phenytoin or sulfinpyrazone). The complex response of coumarins to concomitant drug therapy makes it difficult to predict the occurrence and degree of a deterioration of anticoagulant control in individual patients. For clinical practice, it seems advisable that one should monitor for changes in prothrombin time when adding or deleting any newly approved drug or any drug suspected (e.g. on the basis of this review) to cause an interaction to patients on coumarin therapy. The onset of the adverse prothrombin time response might be from between 1 to 2 days up to 3 weeks (in case of phenprocoumon) after starting a concomitant drug regimen. With amiodarone, an adverse prothrombin time response might occur up to 2 months after initiating therapy. For heparins, only a drug interaction with aspirin or nitroglycerin seems clinically relevant due to the possibility of coadministration during acute cardiac events. Both drugs are shown to enhance the activated partial thromboplastin time response to heparin."

The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important regulator of cell growth and is a key target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1 (mTORC1), consisting of mTOR, Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8) and complex 2 (mTORC2) consisting of mTOR, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1), mLST8 and Protor-1 or Protor-2. Both complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members: mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKC\u03b1 (protein kinase C\u03b1) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2 components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover, Protor knockout mice display no defects in the phosphorylation of Akt and PKC\u03b1 at their hydrophobic or turn motifs. Strikingly, we observed that Protor-1 knockout mice displayed markedly reduced hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of SGK1 and its physiological substrate NDRG1 (N-Myc downregulated gene 1) in the kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that Protor-1 may play a role in enabling mTORC2 to efficiently activate SGK1, at least in the kidney."

Patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens, which include A. baumannii (the ESKAPE pathogens are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). As new therapies are being developed to counter A. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. Here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. The model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. A 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. Uninoculated control wounds healed within 13 days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days. Treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16S rRNA community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. The range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. The model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. Ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals."

We describe the major classes of drug treatments available, including opioid agonist (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM), antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) and non-opioid pharmacotherapies (e.g., alpha2 adrenergic agonists). These treatments are discussed in the context of detoxification and long term treatment options such as abstinence-based and maintenance strategies. We review the state of the literature as to prevention of opioid overdose and discuss the widespread problem of comorbidity among opioid-dependent populations. We also focus prominently on evidence for inclusion of psychosocial approaches in treatment regimens, either as stand-alone or in conjunction with psychopharmacological options."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes. Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion \u03b2-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens. SUMMARY: VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity."

OBJECTIVE: Arboleda et al. have recently shown that IMAGe (intra-uterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital abnormalities) syndrome is caused by gain-of-function mutations of maternally expressed gene CDKN1C on chromosome 11p15.5. However, there is no other report describing clinical findings in patients with molecularly studied IMAGe syndrome. Here, we report clinical and molecular findings in Japanese patients. PATIENTS: We studied a 46,XX patient aged 8\u00b75 years (case 1) and two 46,XY patients aged 16\u00b75 and 15\u00b70 years (cases 2 and 3). RESULTS: Clinical studies revealed not only IMAGe syndrome-compatible phenotypes in cases 1-3, but also hitherto undescribed findings including relative macrocephaly and apparently normal pituitary-gonadal endocrine function in cases 1-3, familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD)-like adrenal phenotype and the history of oligohydramnios in case 2, and arachnodactyly in case 3. Sequence analysis of CDKN1C, pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis of KvDMR1 and high-density oligonucleotide array comparative genome hybridization analysis for chromosome 11p15.5 were performed, showing an identical de novo and maternally inherited CDKN1C gain-of-function mutation (p.Asp274Asn) in cases 1 and 2, respectively, and no demonstrable abnormality in case 3. CONCLUSIONS: The results of cases 1 and 2 with CDKN1C mutation would argue the following: [1] relative macrocephaly is consistent with maternal expression of CDKN1C in most tissues and biparental expression of CDKN1C in the foetal brain; [2] FGD-like phenotype can result from CDKN1C mutation; and [3] genital abnormalities may primarily be ascribed to placental dysfunction. Furthermore, lack of CDKN1C mutation in case 3 implies genetic heterogeneity in IMAGe syndrome."

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer can produce a pathological complete response in the breast in 30-65% of patients. We investigated the effect of the timing of trastuzumab administration with anthracycline and taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: This randomised trial was done at 36 centres in the USA and Puerto Rico. Women with operable HER2-positive invasive breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) with a biased coin minimisation algorithm, stratified for age, tumour size, and hormone receptor status. Neither patients nor investigators (except for a cardiac safety review panel) were masked to treatment assignment. Patients randomly assigned to sequential treatment received fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC-75) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) once per week for 12 weeks, while those randomly assigned to the concurrent treatment group received paclitaxel and trastuzumab once per week for 12 weeks followed by four cycles of FEC-75 (on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and once-weekly trastuzumab, in the same doses as the sequential group. Surgery, including evaluation of the axilla, was done within 6 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant treatment. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who had a pathological complete response in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00513292. FINDINGS: From Sept 15, 2007, to Dec 15, 2011, 282 women were enrolled (140 in the sequential group, 142 in the concurrent group). Two patients in the sequential group withdrew consent before starting treatment. 78 of 138 (56\u00b75%, 95% CI 47\u00b78-64\u00b79) patients who received sequential treatment had a pathological complete response in the breast versus 77 of 142 (54\u00b72%, 95% CI 45\u00b77-62\u00b76) who received concurrent treatment (difference 2\u00b73%, 95% CI -9\u00b73 to 13\u00b79). No treatment-related deaths occurred. The most common severe toxic effects were neutropenia (35 [25\u00b73%] of 138 patients in the sequential group vs 45 [31\u00b77%] of 142 patients in the concurrent group) and fatigue (six [4\u00b73%] vs 12 [8\u00b75%]). Left ventricular ejection fraction dropped below the institutional lower limit of normal at week 12 in one (0\u00b78%) of 130 patients who received sequential treatment and four (2\u00b79%) of 137 patients who received concurrent treatment; by week 24, it had dropped below this limit in nine (7\u00b71%) of 126 patients and in six (4\u00b76%) of 130 patients, respectively.

For several decades circRNAs have been known to exist, however only recently the widespread abundance has become appreciated. Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the tolerability of two different dose-initiation regimens of gabapentin for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures. BACKGROUND: Patient compliance is a key feature of successful outpatient pharmacologic therapy for epilepsy, and one aspect of compliance is simplicity of initiation. By using a rapid titration rate, leading to a rapid therapeutic gabapentin dose, perhaps there could be an improvement with compliance. METHODS: Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentin (following a blinded placebo period of an undisclosed number of days) as either a Slow initiation (300 mg day 1, 600 mg day 2, then 900 mg/day) or a Rapid initiation (900 mg/day immediately following the placebo lead-in). RESULTS: Starting gabapentin therapy at an initial therapeutic dosage of 900 mg/day is well tolerated by patients with epilepsy and is as safe as initiating with a titration schedule over 3 days. Of the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group. CONCLUSION: Initiation of gabapentin at 900 mg/day is as well tolerated as is a 3-day titration, except for a higher incidence of dizziness."

Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is one mechanism leading to PLE. Few syndromes are associated with PIL; Hennekam syndrome (HS) is one of them. The principal treatment for PIL is a high protein, low fat diet with medium chain triglycerides supplementation. Supportive therapy includes albumin infusion. Few publications have supported the use of octreotide to diminish protein loss and minimize hypoalbuminemia seen in PIL. There are no publications on the treatment of PIL with octreotide in patients with HS. We report two children with HS and PLE in which we used octreotide to decrease intestinal protein loss. In one patient, octreotide increased serum albumin to an acceptable level without further need for albumin infusions. The other patient responded more dramatically with near normal serum albumin levels and cessation of albumin infusions. In achieving a good response to octreotide in both patients, we add to the publications supporting the use of octreotide in PIL and suggest that octreotide should be tried in patients with PIL secondary to HS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the use of octreotide in HS-associated PIL."

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the normal appearance of the bony and soft tissue structures of the stifle joint of a Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris) by low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the use of gross anatomical dissections performed as anatomical reference. A cadaver of a mature female was imaged by MRI using specific sequences as the Spin-echo (SE) T1-weighting and Gradient-echo (GE) STIR T2-weighting sequences in sagittal, dorsal and transverse planes, with a magnet of 0.2 Tesla. The bony and articular structures were identified and labelled on anatomical dissections, as well as on the magnetic resonance (MR) images. RESULTS: MR images showed the bone, articular cartilage, menisci and ligaments of the normal tiger stifle. SE T1-weighted sequence provided excellent resolution of the subchondral bones of the femur, tibia and patella compared with the GE STIR T2-weighted MR images. Articular cartilage and synovial fluid were visualised with high signal intensity in GE STIR T2-weighted sequence, compared with SE T1-weighted sequence where they appeared with intermediate intensity signal. Menisci and ligaments of the stifle joint were visible with low signal intensity in both sequences. The infrapatellar fat pad was hyperintense on SE T1-weighted images and showed low signal intensity on GE STIR T2-weighted images. CONCLUSIONS: MRI provided adequate information of the bony and soft tissues structures of Bengal tiger stifle joints. This information can be used as initial anatomic reference for interpretation of MR stifle images and to assist in the diagnosis of diseases of this region."

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1; formerly known as Wermer syndrome) is a rare disorder characterized by the combined occurrence of two or more tumors involving parathyroid, pancreatic islets and anterior pituitary glands; some other tumors have also been described. In most cases it is inherited in an autosomic dominant manner but it may occur sporadically. The MEN1 gene (MEN1) is located on chromosome 11q13, it is composed of ten exons that encode a 610 amino acid protein called menin. Menin, with no homology to any other known protein, interacts with several different proteins and plays an important role in regulation of cell growth, cell cycle, genome stability and synapse plasticity. Familiar MEN1 has a high degree of penetrance with clinical or biochemical manifestations of the disease in 80% and 98%, respectively, by the fifth decade. Clinical manifestations are related to tumor localizations and their secretory products. Hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature of MEN1 (95% of patients), pancreatic islet tumors or pancreatic NET (neuroendocrine tumor) occur in 40-70% and pituitary tumors in 30-40% of MEN 1 patients. In addition, other tumors, such as adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, lipomas, angiofibromas, colagenomas and meningiomas may be present. Occurrence of de novo mutations appear in 10% of all patients with MEN1. A correlation between genotype and phenotype has not been found and, even more, combinations of these tumors may be different in members of the same family. Untreated patients have a decreased life expectancy, with a 50% probability of death by the age of 50 years and the cause of death is mostly directly related to MEN1, being the most important causes malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and thymic carcinoids. Treatment for each type of endocrine tumor is generally similar as in non-MEN1 associated tumors, but results are less successful according to multiplicity of tumors, higher metastatic disease, larger and more aggressive tumors and more resistant to treatment. The prognosis might improve by preclinical tumor diagnosis and appropriated treatment."

Yamanaka factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and their over-expression can induce pluripotency in both mouse and human somatic cells, indicating that these factors regulate the developmental signaling network necessary for ES cell pluripotency. However, systemic analysis of the signaling pathways regulated by Yamanaka factors has not yet been fully described. In this study, we identified the target promoters of endogenous Yamanaka factors on a whole genome scale using ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-on-chip in E14.1 mouse ES cells, and we found that these four factors co-occupied 58 promoters. Interestingly, when Oct4 and Sox2 were analyzed as core factors, Klf4 functioned to enhance the core factors for development regulation, whereas c-Myc seemed to play a distinct role in regulating metabolism. The pathway analysis revealed that Yamanaka factors collectively regulate a developmental signaling network composed of 16 developmental signaling pathways, nine of which represent earlier unknown pathways in ES cells, including apoptosis and cell-cycle pathways. We further analyzed data from a recent study examining Yamanaka factors in mouse ES cells. Interestingly, this analysis also revealed 16 developmental signaling pathways, of which 14 pathways overlap with the ones revealed by this study, despite that the target genes and the signaling pathways regulated by each individual Yamanaka factor differ significantly between these two datasets. We suggest that Yamanaka factors critically regulate a developmental signaling network composed of approximately a dozen crucial developmental signaling pathways to maintain the pluripotency of ES cells and probably also to induce pluripotent stem cells."

Clinical investigations designed to determine risk profiles for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are usually performed in homogenous populations and often focus on body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and fasting triglyceride (TG) levels. However, there are major ethnic differences in the relationship of these risk factors to outcomes. For example, the BMI risk threshold may be higher in blacks than in whites and higher in women than in men. Furthermore, a WC that predicts an obese BMI in white women only predicts a BMI in the overweight category in black women. In addition, overweight black men have a greater risk of developing type 2 DM than do overweight black women. Although TG levels are excellent predictors of insulin resistance in whites, they are not effective markers of insulin resistance in blacks. Among the criteria sets currently available to predict the development of CVD and type 2 DM, the most well known is the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome has 5 criteria: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, fasting hyperglycemia, and hypertension. To make the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, 3 of the 5 factors must be present. For central obesity and low HDL, the metabolic syndrome guidelines are sex specific. Diagnostic guidelines should also take ethnic differences into account, particularly in the diagnosis of central obesity and hypertriglyceridemia."

The Hippo pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell proliferation and survival in Drosophila, which involves the negative regulation of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie by the kinases Hippo and Warts. We have recently shown that the human ortholog of Yorkie, YAP, maps to a minimal amplification locus in mouse and human cancers, and that it mediates dramatic transforming activity in MCF10A primary mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that LATS proteins (mammalian orthologs of Warts) interact directly with YAP in mammalian cells and that ectopic expression of LATS1, but not LATS2, effectively suppresses the YAP phenotypes. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LATS1 phenocopies YAP overexpression. Because this effect can be suppressed by simultaneous YAP knockdown, it suggests that YAP is the primary target of LATS1 in mammalian cells. Expression profiling of genes induced by ectopic expression of YAP or by knockdown of LATS1 reveals a subset of potential Hippo pathway targets implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, suggesting that this is a key feature of YAP signaling in mammalian cells."

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial. We further evaluated the efficacy of tofacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

Activated oncogenes induce compensatory tumour-suppressive responses, such as cellular senescence or apoptosis, but the signals determining the main outcome remain to be fully understood. Here, we uncover a role for Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) in suppressing Myc-induced senescence. Short-term activation of Myc promoted cell-cycle progression in either wild-type or Cdk2 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In the knockout MEFs, however, the initial hyper-proliferative response was followed by cellular senescence. Loss of Cdk2 also caused sensitization to Myc-induced senescence in pancreatic beta-cells or splenic B-cells in vivo, correlating with delayed lymphoma onset in the latter. Cdk2-/- MEFs also senesced upon ectopic Wnt signalling or, without an oncogene, upon oxygen-induced culture shock. Myc also causes senescence in cells lacking the DNA repair protein Wrn. However, unlike loss of Wrn, loss of Cdk2 did not enhance Myc-induced replication stress, implying that these proteins suppress senescence through different routes. In MEFs, Myc-induced senescence was genetically dependent on the ARF-p53-p21Cip1 and p16INK4a-pRb pathways, p21Cip1 and p16INK4a being selectively induced in Cdk2-/- cells. Thus, although redundant for cell-cycle progression and development, Cdk2 has a unique role in suppressing oncogene- and/or stress-induced senescence. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk2 induced Myc-dependent senescence in various cell types, including a p53-null human cancer cell line. Our data warrant re-assessment of Cdk2 as a therapeutic target in Myc- or Wnt-driven tumours."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are created by the reprogramming of somatic cells via overexpression of certain transcription factors, such as the originally described Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM). Here we discuss recent advancements in iPSC reprogramming and introduce mathematical approaches to help map the landscape between cell states during reprogramming. Our modelization indicates that OSKM expression diminishes and/or changes potential barriers between cell states and that epigenetic remodeling facilitate these transitions. From a practical perspective, the modeling approaches outlined here allow us to predict the time necessary to create a given number of iPSC colonies or the number of reprogrammed cells generated in a given time. Additional investigations will help to further refine modeling strategies, rendering them applicable toward the study of the development and stability of cancer cells or even other reprogramming processes such as lineage conversion. Ultimately, a quantitative understanding of cell state transitions might facilitate the establishment of regenerative medicine strategies and enhance the translation of reprogramming technologies into the clinic."

The mTOR kinase controls cell growth, proliferation, and survival through two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR and mLST8 are in both complexes, while raptor and rictor are part of only mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. To investigate mTORC1 and mTORC2 function in vivo, we generated mice deficient for raptor, rictor, or mLST8. Like mice null for mTOR, those lacking raptor die early in development. However, mLST8 null embryos survive until e10.5 and resemble embryos missing rictor. mLST8 is necessary to maintain the rictor-mTOR, but not the raptor-mTOR, interaction, and both mLST8 and rictor are required for the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and PKCalpha, but not S6K1. Furthermore, insulin signaling to FOXO3, but not to TSC2 or GSK3beta, requires mLST8 and rictor. Thus, mTORC1 function is essential in early development, mLST8 is required only for mTORC2 signaling, and mTORC2 is a necessary component of the Akt-FOXO and PKCalpha pathways."

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with lymphoedema cholestasis syndrome 1/Aagenaes Syndrome need a fat reduced diet when cholestatic. We wanted to assess the need for dietary counselling outside cholestatic episodes, and hypothetized that no counselling was needed. METHODS: Fifteen patients above 10 years of age without symptoms of cholestasis were compared with a sex and age matched control group. Diet from a four-day weighed record and blood samples were compared between the two groups and with general Norwegian recommendations. RESULTS: The patients had a similar diet to the healthy controls, except for statistically significant lower intake of energy from total fat (p=0.04) and saturated fat (0.02), and fish (0.05). The patients met the dietary recommendations for macronutrients, except for saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, refined sugar and fibre. Supplements were needed to meet the micronutrient recommendations. Patients had a significantly lower serum level of alpha-tocopherol (0.01) compared with the control group, and the serum 25-OH D level was below reference ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The patients would benefit from counselling on fat quality, carbohydrates including fibre intake, and individual needs for vitamins D and E. To secure serum 25-OH D and alpha-tocopherol levels within reference ranges, regular examinations to determine the need for supplementary vitamins D and E are recommended."

BACKGROUND: The melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene regulates human pigmentation and is highly polymorphic in populations of European origins. The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between MC1R variants and the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and to investigate whether risk estimates differed by phenotypic characteristics. METHODS: Data on 3527 NMSC cases and 9391 controls were gathered through the M-SKIP Project, an international pooled-analysis on MC1R, skin cancer and phenotypic characteristics. We calculated summary odds ratios (SOR) with random-effect models, and performed stratified analyses. RESULTS: Subjects carrying at least one MC1R variant had an increased risk of NMSC overall, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): SOR (95%CI) were 1.48 (1.24-1.76), 1.39 (1.15-1.69) and 1.61 (1.35-1.91), respectively. All of the investigated variants showed positive associations with NMSC, with consistent significant results obtained for V60L, D84E, V92M, R151C, R160W, R163Q and D294H: SOR (95%CI) ranged from 1.42 (1.19-1.70) for V60L to 2.66 (1.06-6.65) for D84E variant. In stratified analysis, there was no consistent pattern of association between MC1R and NMSC by skin type, but we consistently observed higher SORs for subjects without red hair. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled-analysis highlighted a role of MC1R variants in NMSC development and suggested an effect modification by red hair colour phenotype."

Solution based screening has a large supporting body of software such as structure-based virtual screening tools which enable the prediction of protein-ligand complexes. Use of these techniques to predict the protein bound complexes of compounds synthesized on solid support neglects to take into account the conjugation site on the small molecule ligand. This may invalidate predicted binding modes, the linker may be clashing with protein atoms. We present CSBB-ConeExclusion, a methodology and computer program which provides a measure of the applicability of solution dockings to solid support.

In this report, we describe a family with EEM syndrome caused by a novel CDH3 gene mutation and review the mutation spectrum and limb abnormalities in both EEM and HJMD. A protein structure model showing the localization of different mutations causing both syndromes is presented. The CDH3 gene was sequenced and investigation of the mutations performed using a protein structure model. The conservation score was calculated by ConSurf. We identified a novel CDH3 gene mutation, p.G277V, which resides in a conserved residue located on a \u03b2-strand in the second cadherin domain. Review of the data on previously published mutations showed intra-familial and inter-familial variations in the severity of the limb abnormalities. Syndactyly was the most consistent clinical finding present in all the patients regardless of mutation type. The results of our study point to a phenotypic continuum between HJMD and EEM. It is important for genetic counseling to keep in mind the possible clinical/phenotypic overlap between these 2 syndromes and to be aware of the possible risk of limb abnormalities in future pregnancies in families with HJMD syndrome. CDH3 gene mutation screening is recommended in patients with both these syndromes as part of the work-up in order to offer appropriate genetic counseling."

Flurodopa (FDOPA) is an analogue of L-di-hydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) used to assess the nigrostriatal dopamine system in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). However, FDOPA/PET quantitation is complicated by the presence of the 3-O-methyl-FDOPA (3OMFD) fraction in brain and plasma. Pretreatment with entacapone (OR-611), a peripheral catechol O-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor, greatly reduces the plasma 3OMFD fraction and provides an ideal situation to evaluate the contribution of the plasma 3OMFD fraction in several kinetic models of FDOPA uptake. We performed FDOPA/PET with and without the OR-611 preadministration in six Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We measured the time-course of the plasma FDOPA and 3OMFD fractions using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). We calculated striato-occipital ratios (SOR), and estimated the striatal FDOPA uptake rate constant graphically using the plasma FDOPA and occipital tissue time activity curves (KiFD and KiOCC, respectively). We also estimated striatal dopa decarboxylase (DDC) activity (k3D) using a model incorporating independent measurements of 3OMFD transport kinetic rate constants. With the preadministration of OR-611, the pharmacological efficiency in plasma was prolonged significantly (21.1-37.7%; p < 0.01). We also observed significant mean elevations in SOR and KiOCC by 21.8 and 53.5%, respectively (p < 0.05). KiFD and k3D did not show significant change. We conclude that OR-611 prolongs the circulation time of FDOPA in the plasma but does not alter rate constants for striatal FDOPA uptake or decarboxylation."

This study evaluated the differential impact of SMAD4 and BMPR1A gene mutations on cancer risk and oncological phenotype in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. METHODS: Patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome and germline SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations were identified from a prospectively maintained institutional registry. Medical records were reviewed and the clinical patterns of disease were analysed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients had germline mutations in either BMPR1A (8 patients) or SMAD4 (27). Median follow-up was 11 years. Colonic phenotype was similar between patients with SMAD4 and BMPR1A mutations, whereas SMAD4 mutations were associated with larger polyp numbers (number of patients with 50 or more gastric polyps: 14 versus 0 respectively). The numbers of patients with rectal polyps was comparable between BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutation carriers (5 versus 17). No patient was diagnosed with cancer in the BMPR1A group, whereas four men with a SMAD4 mutation developed gastrointestinal (3) or extraintestinal (1) cancer. The gastrointestinal cancer risk in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome and a SMAD4 mutation was 11 per cent (3 of 27).

The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), also known as MALAT-1 or NEAT2 (nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2), is a highly conserved nuclear noncoding RNA (ncRNA) and a predictive marker for metastasis development in lung cancer. To uncover its functional importance, we developed a MALAT1 knockout model in human lung tumor cells by genomically integrating RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases. The achieved 1,000-fold MALAT1 silencing provides a unique loss-of-function model. Proposed mechanisms of action include regulation of splicing or gene expression. In lung cancer, MALAT1 does not alter alternative splicing but actively regulates gene expression including a set of metastasis-associated genes. Consequently, MALAT1-deficient cells are impaired in migration and form fewer tumor nodules in a mouse xenograft. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) blocking MALAT1 prevent metastasis formation after tumor implantation. Thus, targeting MALAT1 with ASOs provides a potential therapeutic approach to prevent lung cancer metastasis with this ncRNA serving as both predictive marker and therapeutic target. Finally, regulating gene expression, but not alternative splicing, is the critical function of MALAT1 in lung cancer metastasis. In summary, 10 years after the discovery of the lncRNA MALAT1 as a biomarker for lung cancer metastasis, our loss-of-function model unravels the active function of MALAT1 as a regulator of gene expression governing hallmarks of lung cancer metastasis."

Genotyping these polymorphisms has been shown to be important in reducing the time of the trial and error process for finding the maintenance dose of warfarin thus reducing the risk of adverse effects of the drug. METHOD: We developed a real-time isothermal DNA amplification system for genotyping three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence warfarin response. For each SNP, real-time isothermal Helicase Dependent Amplification (HDA) reactions were performed to amplify a DNA fragment containing the SNP. Amplicons were detected by fluorescently labeled allele specific probes during real-time HDA amplification. RESULTS: Fifty clinical samples were analyzed by the HDA-based method, generating a total of 150 results. Of these, 148 were consistent between the HDA-based assays and a reference method. The two samples with unresolved HDA-based test results were repeated and found to be consistent with the reference method. CONCLUSION: The HDA-based assays demonstrated a clinically acceptable performance for genotyping the VKORC1 -1639G>A SNP and two SNPs (430C>T and 1075A>C) for the CYP2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3), all of which are relevant in warfarin pharmacogenentics."

Recent analyses of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) revealed that Pol II is concentrated at the promoters of many active and inactive genes. NELF causes Pol II to pause in the promoter-proximal region of the hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, genome-wide location analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray chip [ChIP-chip] analysis) revealed that NELF is concentrated at the 5' ends of 2,111 genes in Drosophila cells. Permanganate genomic footprinting was used to determine if paused Pol II colocalized with NELF. Forty-six of 56 genes with NELF were found to have paused Pol II. Pol II pauses 30 to 50 nucleotides downstream from transcription start sites. Analysis of DNA sequences in the vicinity of paused Pol II identified a conserved DNA sequence that probably associates with TFIID but detected no evidence of RNA secondary structures or other conserved sequences that might directly control elongation. ChIP-chip experiments indicate that GAGA factor associates with 39% of the genes that have NELF. Surprisingly, NELF associates with almost one-half of the most highly expressed genes, indicating that NELF is not necessarily a repressor of gene expression. NELF-associated pausing of Pol II might be an obligatory but sometimes transient checkpoint during the transcription cycle."

BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) and the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) are known to contribute to variability in sensitivity to coumarins. Patients with certain common genetic variants of CYP2C9 (*2 & *3) or a VKORC1 polymorphism (-1639A Allele) require a lower dose of coumarin and are also at higher risk for over-anticoagulation and serious bleeding. In August 2007, the FDA label for warfarin was updated to highlight the benefit of genetic testing to predict warfarin response. AIM: Since the prevalence of these variants in the Lebanese population has not yet been reported, our aim was to determine the genotypes of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 in our population and to compare allele frequencies with previous findings from other ethnic groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CYP2C9 (*1/*2/*3) and VKORC1 (*A/*G) allelic variants were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays in a diversified sample of 161 unrelated healthy Lebanese volunteers. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of CYP2C9 *2 and *3 were 0.112 and 0.096 respectively, whereas VKORC1-1639A was 0.528. Carriers of the CYP2C9 *2 or *3 represented 34.2% of the subjects, whereas those of the VKORC1-1639A represented 73.9%. CONCLUSION: Our data show no significant difference in the frequency of CYP2C9 allelic variants when compared to the Caucasian population, whereas the allelic frequency of VKORC1-1639A was very high. Over 50% of the Lebanese population seem to be carrying more than two independent risk alleles, and is therefore potentially at high risk of over-anticoagulation."

PURPOSE: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of one in 3,500 births. Clinically, NF1 is characterized by caf\u00e9-au-lait (CAL) spots, neurofibromas, freckling of the axillary or inguinal region, Lisch nodules, optic nerve glioma, and bone dysplasias. NF1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the 17q11.2-located NF1 gene. We present a clinical and molecular study of an Italian family with NF1. METHODS: The proband, a 10-year-old boy, showed large CAL spots and freckling on the axillary region and plexiform neurofibromas on the right side only. His father (47 years old) showed, in addition to the similar signs, numerous neurofibromas of various sizes on his thorax, abdomen, back, and shoulder. Two additional family members (a brother and a sister of the proband) presented only small CAL spots. The coding exons of NF1 gene were analyzed for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing in all family members. RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c.654 ins A) in all affected family members. This novel mutation creates a shift on the reading frame starting at codon 218 and leads to the introduction of a premature stop at codon 227. CONCLUSIONS: The segregation of the mutation with the affected phenotype and its absence in the 200 normal chromosomes suggest that it is responsible for the NF1 phenotype."

Generation of new blood vessels from existing vessels was promoted 2- to 3-fold by either T(4) or T(3) at 10(-8)-10(-7) M total hormone concentrations. In the present studies, nanomolar concentrations of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), a thyroid hormone analog with inotropic but not chronotropic properties, exhibited potent proangiogenic activity that was comparable to that obtained with T(3) and T(4) in both the CAM model and in an in vitro three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting assay. The proangiogenesis effect of DITPA was inhibited by tetraiodothyroacetic acid, a thyroid hormone analog that competes with T(4) and T(3) for a novel cell surface hormone receptor site on integrin alphavbeta3. The thyroid hormone analogs DITPA, T(4), and T(4)-agarose, as well as basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, demonstrated comparable proangiogenic effects in the CAM model and in the three-dimensional human microvascular endothelial sprouting model. The proangiogenesis effect of either DITPA or b-FGF was blocked by PD 98059, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade. Additionally, a specific integrin alphavbeta3 small molecule antagonist, XT199, effectively inhibited the proangiogenesis effect of DITPA and b-FGF. Thus, the proangiogenesis actions of thyroid hormone and its analog DITPA are initiated at the plasma membrane, apparently at integrin alphavbeta3, and are MAPK dependent."

Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin. To better understand the role of triadin 1 in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive protein expression. The protein was overexpressed 5-fold in mouse ventricles, and overexpression was accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy. The levels of two other junctional SR proteins, the ryanodine receptor and junctin, were reduced by 55% and 73%, respectively, in association with triadin 1 overexpression, whereas the levels of calsequestrin, the Ca(2+)-binding protein of junctional SR, and of phospholamban and SERCA2a, Ca(2+)-handling proteins of the free SR, were unchanged. Cardiac myocytes from triadin 1-overexpressing mice exhibited depressed contractility; Ca(2+) transients decayed at a slower rate, and cell shortening and relengthening were diminished. The extent of depression of cell shortening of triadin 1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes was rate-dependent, being more depressed under low stimulation frequencies (0.5 Hz), but reaching comparable levels at higher frequencies of stimulation (5 Hz). Spontaneously beating, isolated work-performing heart preparations overexpressing triadin 1 also relaxed at a slower rate than control hearts, and failed to adapt to increased afterload appropriately. The fast time inactivation constant, tau(1), of the l-type Ca(2+) channel was prolonged in transgenic cardiomyocytes. Our results provide evidence for the coordinated regulation of junctional SR protein expression in heart independent of free SR protein expression, and furthermore suggest an important role for triadin 1 in regulating the contractile properties of the heart during excitation-contraction coupling."

Autophagy is an important catabolic process with roles in cell survival and cell death. It sequesters cytosol and organelles within double-membrane autophagosomes that deliver their contents to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagosome biogenesis is coordinated by the autophagy-related protein 4 (Atg4) family of C54 endopeptidases (Atg4A-Atg4D). These enzymes prime and then later delipidate the autophagosome marker, Atg8. Here, we show that one family member, Atg4D, is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro and in apoptotic cells. Atg4D is a poor priming and delipidation enzyme in vitro, but truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1). In living cells, DeltaN63 Atg4D stimulates the delipidation of GABARAP-L1, whereas siRNA silencing of the gene expressing Atg4D abrogates GABARAP-L1 autophagosome formation and sensitises cells to starvation and staurosporine-induced cell death. Interestingly, Atg4D overexpression induces apoptosis, which is preceded by the caspase-independent recruitment of Atg4D to mitochondria and is facilitated by a putative C-terminal Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Atg4D also acquires affinity for damaged mitochondria in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. These data suggest that Atg4D is an autophagy regulator that links mitochondrial dysfunction with apoptosis."

Recently, genetic linkage has been demonstrated between the COL5A1 gene, which encodes the alphal chain of type V collagen, and EDS type II in a large British kindred. Using a polymorphic intragenic simple sequence repeat at the COL5A1 locus, we now demonstrate tight linkage to EDS type I/II in a three-generation family, giving a LOD score (log10 of the odds for linkage) of 4.07 at zero recombination. The variation in expression in this family suggests that EDS types I and II are allelic, and the linkage data support the hypothesis that mutation in COL5A1 can cause both phenotypes."

We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls. Pigs with severe HF demonstrated an increased expression of TH and DBH (but neither AAAD nor PNMT) as compared to animals with milder HF and controls (P<0.05 in all cases). The increased adrenal mRNA expression of TH and DBH was accompanied by a reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) (P<0.001) and an elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (P<0.01), the other indices reflecting HF severity. There was a positive relationship between the increased adrenal mRNA expression of TH and DBH, and the high levels of circulating adrenaline and noradrenaline (all P<0.05). The association with noradrenaline remained significant also when adjusted for LVEF and plasma BNP, suggesting a significant contribution of adrenals to the circulating pool of catecholamines in subjects with systolic HF."

Most of families with EDMD show X-linked recessive inheritance with mutations in the STA gene on chromosome Xq28, which encodes a protein named emerin. A rare autosomal dominant form of EDMD (AD-EDMD) is caused by mutations in lamin A/C gene (LMNA) on chromosome 1q21. Both emerin and lamin A/C are located in the inner surface membrane of the nucleus. A 49-year-old woman was skinny and slow runner from childhood and suspected as having a certain muscular disorder. At 35 years, she was found to have the second degree atrioventricular block. At 45 years, she was admitted to a hospital for right-side hemiplegia after cerebral infarction. Cardiac involvement was also observed including high degree atrioventricular block with chronic atrial fibrillation and frequent paroxysmal ventricular contraction on the electrocardiogram. At 49 years, she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. She had possible dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction block. She also had muscular atrophy and weakness in all extremities, predominantly in the right-side, and contracture of bilateral Achilles tendon, knee and elbow joints, and postcervical muscles. Biopsied skeletal muscle and electromyogram showed myopathic changes.

RESULTS: The phenotypic algorithm was able to differentiate MBL from KPC producers as well as to detect the possible co-production of both carbapenemases (positive result only with the combined-disc test using meropenem alone and with both PBA and EDTA). The method detected all KPC or MBL producers (sensitivity 100%) as well as 30 of the KPC and MBL producers (sensitivity 96.8%). All three combined-disc tests were negative for non-carbapenemase-producing isolates, except two ESBL and AmpC producers that gave positive combined-disc tests using meropenem alone and with PBA and both PBA and EDTA (specificity for KPC detection 98.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This phenotypic method is very helpful to detect carbapenemase production and provides a simple algorithm for the differentiation of KPC and MBL enzymes, especially in regions where KPC- and MBL-possessing Enterobacteriaceae are highly prevalent."

BACKGROUND: B-cell prolymphocytic leukemias or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias are aggressive variants of chronic lymphoid leukemias. The small studies conducted to date have shown median survival durations of approximately 3 years for patients who have B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and 7.5 months for those who have T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, compared with about 8 years for patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemotherapy consisting of alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil combined with prednisone has achieved overall response rates of 50% to 70%, but this regimen has resulted in response rates of less than 25% in prolymphocytic leukemia. Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; DCF) is a purine analogue that has shown activity in treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies. PURPOSE: This prospective phase II trial by the Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer was performed to assess the activity and toxicity of DCF in prolymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: Twenty patients with B-cell or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia were given DCF at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 3 weeks, then every other week for three doses. Patients who had at least partial response received maintenance therapy once a month for a maximum of 6 months. Fourteen patients had B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and six had T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, as evidenced by morphologic and immunologic criteria; three were previously untreated, eight had been given one or two chemotherapeutic regimens, and nine had been given more than two. RESULTS: One patient died of an unknown cause during the first 6 weeks of treatment, and one died of disseminated toxoplasmosis during the period of maintenance therapy, 5 months after achieving partial remission. Nine (45% response rate) of the 20 patients achieved partial remission, including seven (50%) of 14 with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and two (33%) of six with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. The median duration of response was 9 months (range, 2-30 months); for patients with B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, the median remission duration was 12 months. No complete remission was observed. Toxic effects included nausea and vomiting (30%), infections (30%), and transient increase in liver enzymes (35%) and in creatinine (20%) levels. Eight patients experienced thrombocytopenia, the major hematologic toxic effect; four had grade 3 or 4 toxic effects. CONCLUSION: DCF is active in prolymphocytic leukemia, even as salvage therapy in patients who had received multiple prior chemotherapeutic regimens. IMPLICATIONS: Trials using DCF or other purine analogues alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents in front-line or salvage therapy are warranted to improve the prognosis of patients with prolymphocytic leukemia."

Multidrug resistance among the 'ESKAPE' organisms - encompassing Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. - is of particular concern because they are responsible for many serious infections in hospitals. Although some promising agents are in the pipeline, there is an urgent need for new antibiotic scaffolds. However, antibacterial researchers have struggled to identify new small molecules with meaningful cellular activity, especially those effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. This difficulty ultimately stems from an incomplete understanding of efflux systems and compound permeation through bacterial membranes. This Opinion article describes findings from target-based and phenotypic screening efforts carried out at AstraZeneca over the past decade, discusses some of the subsequent chemistry challenges and concludes with a description of new approaches comprising a combination of computational modelling and advanced biological tools which may pave the way towards the discovery of new antibacterial agents."

OBJECTIVE: To identify and categorize the variety of current mobile apps available in dermatology for patients and providers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Dermatology-related search terms were queried in the online app stores of the most commonly used mobile platforms developed by Apple, Android, Blackberry, Nokia, and Windows. Applications were assigned to categories based on description. Popularity, price, and reviews were recorded and target audiences were determined through websites offering online mobile apps. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number, type, and price of mobile apps in dermatology. RESULTS: A total of 229 dermatology-related apps were identified in the following categories: general dermatology reference (61 [26.6%]), self-surveillance/diagnosis (41 [17.9%]), disease guide (39 [17.0%]), educational aid (20 [8.7%]), sunscreen/UV recommendation (19 [8.3%]), calculator (12 [5.2%]), teledermatology (8 [3.5%]), conference (6 [2.6%]), journal (6 [2.6%]), photograph storage/sharing (5 [2.2%]), dermoscopy (2 [0.9%]), pathology (2 [0.9%]), and other (8 [3.5%]). The most reviewed apps included Ultraviolet ~ UV Index (355 reviews), VisualDx (306), SPF (128), iSore (61), and SpotMole (50). There were 209 unique apps, with 17 apps existing on more than 1 operating system. More than half of the apps were offered free of charge (117 [51.1%]). Paid apps (112 [48.9%]) ranged from $0.99 to $139.99 (median, $2.99). Target audiences included patient (117 [51.1%]), health care provider (94 [41.0%]), and both (18 [7.9%]).

Chronic isolation of adult animals represents a form of psychological stress that produces sympatho-adrenomedullar activation.

This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-\u00df-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks. Also, we examined how additional acute immobilization stress changes the mentioned parameters. Treadmill running did not result in modulation of gene expression of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes and it decreased the level of CREB mRNA in the adrenal medulla of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats. The potentially negative physiological adaptations after treadmill running were recorded as increased concentrations of catecholamines and decreased morning CORT concentration in the plasma, as well as the adrenal gland hypertrophy of chronically psychosocially stressed rats. The additional acute immobilization stress increases gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes in the adrenal medulla, as well as catecholamines and CORT levels in the plasma.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to understand the possible risk of discontinuation in the context of clinical care. BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation patients. Concerns exist regarding possible increased risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) thromboembolic events early after discontinuation of rivaroxaban. METHODS: We undertook a post-hoc analysis of data from the ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once-Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, n = 14,624) for stroke or non-CNS embolism within 30 days after temporary interruptions of 3 days or more, early permanent study drug discontinuation, and end-of-study transition to open-label therapy. RESULTS: Stroke and non-CNS embolism occurred at similar rates after temporary interruptions (rivaroxaban: n = 9, warfarin: n = 8, 6.20 vs. 5.05/100 patient-years, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 to 3.31, p = 0.62) and after early permanent discontinuation (rivaroxaban: n = 42, warfarin: n = 36, 25.60 vs. 23.28/100 patient-years, HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.72, p = 0.66). Patients transitioning to open-label therapy at the end of the study had more strokes with rivaroxaban (n = 22) versus warfarin (n = 6, 6.42 vs. 1.73/100 patient-years, HR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.51 to 9.16, p = 0.0044) and took longer to reach a therapeutic international normalized ratio with rivaroxaban versus warfarin. All thrombotic events within 30 days of any study drug cessation (including stroke, non-CNS embolism, myocardial infarction, and vascular death) were similar between groups (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.26, p = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: In atrial fibrillation patients who temporarily or permanently discontinued anticoagulation, the risk of stroke or non-CNS embolism was similar with rivaroxaban or warfarin. An increased risk of stroke and non-CNS embolism was observed in rivaroxaban-treated patients compared with warfarin-treated patients after the end of the study, underscoring the importance of therapeutic anticoagulation coverage during such a transition."

Here, we present a specifically designed web-accessible database, Super-Enhancer Archive (SEA, http://sea.edbc.org). SEA focuses on integrating super-enhancers in multiple species and annotating their potential roles in the regulation of cell identity gene expression. The current release of SEA incorporates 83 996 super-enhancers computationally or experimentally identified in 134 cell types/tissues/diseases, including human (75 439, three of which were experimentally identified), mouse (5879, five of which were experimentally identified), Drosophila melanogaster (1774) and Caenorhabditis elegans (904). To facilitate data extraction, SEA supports multiple search options, including species, genome location, gene name, cell type/tissue and super-enhancer name. The response provides detailed (epi)genetic information, incorporating cell type specificity, nearby genes, transcriptional factor binding sites, CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, evolutionary conservation, SNPs, H3K27ac, DNA methylation, gene expression and TF ChIP-seq data. Moreover, analytical tools and a genome browser were developed for users to explore super-enhancers and their roles in defining cell identity and disease processes in depth."

The management of each entity differs to some degree from their sporadic counterparts, while the lack of a genotype-phenotype correlation requires lifelong clinical, biochemical and radiological screening for the development of new tumors. While the syndrome itself is relatively rare (a prevalence of 1-10/100 000), it is likely that health-care practitioners from numerous specialities will occasionally encounter a patient with MEN1 and therefore a basic knowledge of the syndrome is important. In addition, many of the associated tumors are seen commonly in sporadic form, and a judicious policy is therefore required in deciding how thoroughly patients who develop these tumors should be screened for MEN1.

PURPOSE: To describe the genotype-phenotype relationship of a cohort of consecutive patients with isolated ectopia lentis (EL) secondary to ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 mutations. METHODS: Patients underwent detailed ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal examination. This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae. Echocardiography and skeletal examination revealed no sign of systemic disorders associated with EL, in particular Marfan syndrome (MFS). Nine patients (52.9%) were found to have mutations in ADAMTSL4, including four novel nonsense mutations. Four patients (25%) were found to have novel FBN1 mutations, not previously reported as causing classical Marfan syndrome. One additional patient was found to have an FBN1 mutation previously reported in classical MFS. Four patients (25%) were found to have no mutations in either gene. Median age of diagnosis of EL was 35 years in patients with FBN1 mutations and 2 years in patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations (P < 0.01). Mean axial length was 22.74 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.3-24.2) (FBN1) and 27.54 mm (95% CI: 24.2-30.9) (ADAMTSL4) (P < 0.01). Other ophthalmic features, including corneal thickness and power, foveal thickness, visual acuity, and direction of lens displacement, were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene."

OBJECTIVES: Activating mutations in the human KCNJ11 gene, encoding the pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, are one cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus. In a few patients, KCNJ11 mutations cause a triad of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND syndrome). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical effects, functional cause, and sensitivity to sulfonylurea treatment of a novel KCNJ11 mutation producing DEND syndrome. METHODS: We screened the DNA of a 3-year-old patient with neonatal diabetes, severe developmental delay, and therapy-resistant epilepsy for mutations in KCNJ11. We carried out electrophysiologic analysis of wild-type and mutant K(ATP) channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. RESULTS: We identified a novel Kir6.2 mutation (I167L) causing DEND syndrome. Functional analysis showed both homomeric and heterozygous mutant channels were less inhibited by MgATP leading to an increase in whole-cell K(ATP) currents. This effect was due to an increase in the intrinsic open probability. Heterozygous channels were strongly inhibited by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide. Treatment of the patient with the sulfonylurea glibenclamide not only enabled insulin therapy to be stopped, but also resulted in improvement in epilepsy and psychomotor abilities. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome that shows neurologic improvement with sulfonylurea therapy. Early recognition of patients with DEND syndrome may have considerable therapeutic benefit for the patient."

A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region. A single haplotype consisting of seven SNPs at the RNF213 locus was tightly associated with MMD (P = 5.3 \u00d7 10(-10)). RNF213 encodes a really interesting new gene finger protein with an AAA ATPase domain and is abundantly expressed in spleen and leukocytes. An RNA in situ hybridization analysis of mouse tissues indicated that mature lymphocytes express higher levels of Rnf213 mRNA than their immature counterparts. Mutational analysis of RNF213 revealed a founder mutation, p.R4859K, in 95% of MMD families, 73% of non-familial MMD cases and 1.4% of controls; this mutation greatly increases the risk of MMD (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10(-43), odds ratio = 190.8, 95% confidence interval = 71.7-507.9). Three additional missense mutations were identified in the p.R4859K-negative patients. These results indicate that RNF213 is the first identified susceptibility gene for MMD."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs representing one of the most exciting areas of modern medical science. miRNAs modulate a large and complex regulatory network of gene expression of the majority of the protein-coding genes. Currently, evidences suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Some miRNAs as miR-1, miR-133 and miR-208a are highly expressed in the heart and strongly associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recent data indicate that these miRNAs as well as miR-206 change their expression quickly in response to physical activity. The differential regulation of miRNAs in response to exercise suggests a potential value of circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) as biomarkers of physiological mediators of the cardiovascular adaptation induced by exercise. Likewise, serum levels of c-miRNAs such as miR-423-5p have been evaluated as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure. On the other hand, the manipulation of miRNAs levels using techniques such as 'miR mimics' and 'antagomiRs' is becoming evident the enormous potential of miRNAs as promising therapeutic strategies in heart failure."

BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an idiopathic steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease that represents an important cause of stroke. However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for autosomal dominant moyamoya disease on chromosome 17q25.3."

RESULTS: Two hundred interphase cells were counted and cells with three green hybridization spots > 3% was assigned. Eleven cases displayed trisomy 8 by CC and were confirmed in 10 by FISH. In 7 cases, the percentage of trisomy 8 cells was significantly lower by FISH than by CC. Seven cases displayed trisomy 8 by FISH in 58 cases who did not show trisomy 8 by CC. Of the 7 cases, two had 2 and 3 marker chromosomes respectively, 4 had normal karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Interphase FISH was a useful method for the detection of trisomy 8 in MDS, especially in patients with normal karyotype or marker chromosome. It was a important complement to CC."

A key step in the predicted mechanism of enzymatic transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to cytosine residues in DNA is the transient formation of a dihydrocytosine intermediate covalently linked to cysteine in the active site of a DNA (cytosine C5)-methyltransferase (DNA C5-MTase). Crystallographic analysis of complexes formed by HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI), AdoMet and a target oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing 5-fluorocytosine confirmed the existence of this dihydrocytosine intermediate. Based on the premise that 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine (DZCyt), a cytosine analog with an sp3-hybridized carbon (CH2) at position 6 and an NH group at position 5, could mimic the non-aromatic character of the cytosine ring in this transition state, we synthesized a series of synthetic substrates for DNA C5-MTase containing DZCyt. Substitution of DZCyt for target cytosines in C-G dinucleotides of single-stranded or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates led to complete inhibition of methylation by murine DNA C5-MTase. Substitution of DZCyt for the target cytosine in G-C-G-C sites in double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides had a similar effect on methylation by M. HhaI. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing DZCyt formed a tight but reversible complex with M.HhaI, and were consistently more potent as inhibitors of DNA methylation than oligodeoxyribonucleotides identical in sequence containing 5-fluorocytosine. Crystallographic analysis of a ternary complex involving M.HhaI, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and a double-stranded 13-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing DZCyt at the target position showed that the analog is flipped out of the DNA helix in the same manner as cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and 5-fluorocytosine. However, no formation of a covalent bond was detected between the sulfur atom of the catalytic site nucleophile, cysteine 81, and the pyrimidine C6 carbon. These results indicate that DZCyt can occupy the active site of M.HhaI as a transition state mimic and, because of the high degree of affinity of its interaction with the enzyme, it can act as a potent inhibitor of methylation."

Patients are also prone to carcinomas, particularly of the head and neck. The disease has X-linked or autosomal dominant/recessive inheritance. Early childhood variants (Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome) are associated with immunological abnormalities in the form of low T- and B-cell numbers. Four genes, namely DKC1 (codes for dyskerin), TERC and TERT (code for telomerase) and NOP10, have been implicated in the pathogenesis; the short telomeres provide a marker for genetic linkage studies. Androgens, with or without granulocyte colony stimulating factor, have been tried in the treatment of the conditions with variable results. Stem cell transplantation from matched sibling donor is currently the treatment of choice. It requires modified nonmyeloablative conditioning protocols, since the patients with DC are prone to pulmonary and hepatic complications."

EWS/FLI dysregulates gene expression during tumorigenesis by abnormally activating or repressing genes. The expression levels of thousands of genes are affected in Ewing sarcoma, however, it is unknown which of these genes contribute to the transformed phenotype. Here we characterize BCL11B as an up-regulated EWS/FLI target that is necessary for the maintenance of transformation in patient derived Ewing sarcoma cells lines. BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing's sarcoma and contributes to the EWS/FLI repressed gene signature. BCL11B repressive activity is mediated by the NuRD co-repressor complex. We further demonstrate that re-expression of SPRY1, a repressed target of BCL11B, limits the transformation capacity of Ewing sarcoma cells.

RNA-templated RNA replication is essential for viral or viroid infection, as well as for regulation of cellular gene expression. Specific RNA motifs likely regulate various aspects of this replication. Viroids of the Pospiviroidae family, as represented by the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), replicate in the nucleus by utilizing DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II. We investigated the role of the loop E (sarcin/ricin) motif of the PSTVd genomic RNA in replication. A tertiary-structural model of this motif, inferred by comparative sequence analysis and comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystal structures of loop E motifs in other RNAs, is presented in which core non-Watson-Crick base pairs are precisely specified. Isostericity matrix analysis of these base pairs showed that the model accounts for the reported natural sequence variations and viable experimental mutations in loop E motifs of PSTVd and other viroids. Furthermore, isostericity matrix analysis allowed us to design disruptive, as well as compensatory, mutations of PSTVd loop E. Functional analyses of such mutants by in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that loop E structural integrity is crucial for replication, specifically during transcription. Our results suggest that the PSTVd loop E motif exists and functions in vivo and provide loss-of-function genetic evidence for the essential role of a viroid RNA three-dimensional motif in rolling-circle replication. The use of isostericity matrix analysis of non-Watson-Crick base pairing to rationalize mutagenesis of tertiary motifs and systematic in vitro and in vivo functional assays of mutants offers a novel, comprehensive approach to elucidate the tertiary-structure-function relationships for RNA motifs of general biological significance."

OBJECTIVE: Anti-TNF therapies have been highly efficacious in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but 25-30% of patients do not show a significant clinical response. There is increasing evidence that genetic variation at the Fc receptor FCGR2A is associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy. We aimed to validate this genetic association in a patient cohort from the Spanish population, and also to identify new genes functionally related to FCGR2A that are also associated with anti-TNF response. METHODS: A total of 348 RA patients treated with an anti-TNF therapy were included and genotyped for FCGR2A polymorphism rs1081274. Response to therapy was determined at 12 weeks, and was tested for association globally and independently for each anti-TNF drug (infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab). Using gene expression profiles from macrophages obtained from synovial fluid of RA patients, we searched for genes highly correlated with FCGR2A expression. Tag SNPs were selected from each candidate gene and tested for association with the response to therapy. RESULTS: We found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to adalimumab (P=0.022). Analyzing the subset of anti-CCP positive RA patients (78%), we also found a significant association between FCGR2A and the response to infliximab (P=0.035). DHX32 and RGS12 were the most consistently correlated genes with FCGR2A expression in RA synovial fluid macrophages (P<0.001). We found a significant association between the genetic variation at DHX32 (rs12356233, corrected P=0.019) and a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to adalimumab (rs4690093, uncorrected P=0.040). In the anti-CCP positive group of patients, we also found a nominally significant association between RGS12 and the response to infliximab (rs2857859, uncorrected P=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we have validated the FCGR2A association in an independent population, and we have identified new genes associated with the response to anti-TNF therapy in RA."

Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder which can be classified according to the underlying neuropathology and is associated with disturbances of respiration, laryngeal function, airflow direction, and articulation resulting in difficulties of speech quality and intelligibility. There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. The features of the speech disturbance of these six major types of dysarthria are distinctive and can assist with diagnosis. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom of many neurological conditions and is commonly associated with progressive neurological disease. It has a profound effect upon the patient and their families as communication is integrally related with expressing personality and social relationships. Speech and language therapy can be used to encourage the person to use the speech that is already available to them more effectively, can increase the range and consistency of sound production, can teach strategies for improving intelligibility and communicative effectiveness, can guide the individual to use methods that are less tiring and more successful, and can introduce the appropriate Augmentative and Alternative Communication approaches as and when required."

We show that the MMR system is functional in this organism, where it participates in ensuring the fidelity of DNA replication and recombination. The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition. Inactivation of MutS1 or MutL resulted in a seven-fold increase in the frequency of spontaneous RifR mutagenesis and a ten-fold increase in the efficiency of integration of a donor point-mutation marker during bacterial transformation. Inactivation of the mismatch repair-associated UvrD helicase increased the level of spontaneous mutagenesis, but had no effect on marker integration--suggesting that binding of MutS1 and MutL proteins to a mismatched heteroduplex suffices to inhibit recombination between non identical (homeologous) DNAs. In contrast, inactivation of MutS2, encoded by the second mutS -related gene present in D. radiodurans, had no effect on mutagenesis or recombination. Cells devoid of MutS1 or MutL proteins were as resistant to gamma-rays, mitomycin C and UV-irradiation as wild-type bacteria, suggesting that the mismatch repair system is not essential for the reconstitution of a functional genome after DNA damage."

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) was significantly reduced in AMI [33 (SEM 2.1) vs 79(2.5) in SHAM, p < 0.05] and was further declined in AMI-DBD [22(1.1) vs 33(2.1), respectively, p < 0.05]. Cardiac mass was increased in AMI but not in AMI-DBD hearts, resulting in significant increase in wall tension index. This increase in wall stress was accompanied by marked activation of p38 MAPK, a kinase that is sensitive to mechanical stretch and exerts negative inotropic effect. Furthermore, AMI resulted in \u03b2-myosin heavy chain overexpression and reduction in the ratio of SR(Ca)ATPase to phospholamban (PLB). The latter further declined in AMI-DBD mainly due to increased expression of PLB. AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TR\u03b11 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function. p38 MAPK and PLB may, at least in part, be involved in this response."

Based on the anatomical and functional commonality between singing and speech, various types of musical elements have been employed in music therapy research for speech rehabilitation. This study was to develop an accent-based music speech protocol to address voice problems of stroke patients with mixed dysarthria. Subjects were 6 stroke patients with mixed dysarthria and they received individual music therapy sessions. Each session was conducted for 30 minutes and 12 sessions including pre- and post-test were administered for each patient. For examining the protocol efficacy, the measures of maximum phonation time (MPT), fundamental frequency (F0), average intensity (dB), jitter, shimmer, noise to harmonics ratio (NHR), and diadochokinesis (DDK) were compared between pre and post-test and analyzed with a paired sample t-test. The results showed that the measures of MPT, F0, dB, and sequential motion rates (SMR) were significantly increased after administering the protocol. Also, there were statistically significant differences in the measures of shimmer, and alternating motion rates (AMR) of the syllable /K$\\inve$/ between pre- and post-test. The results indicated that the accent-based music speech protocol may improve speech motor coordination including respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance, and prosody of patients with dysarthria. This suggests the possibility of utilizing the music speech protocol to maximize immediate treatment effects in the course of a long-term treatment for patients with dysarthria."

Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic re uptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia.Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks."

Lowering serum lipid levels is part of the foundation of treating and preventing clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Recently, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology released cholesterol guidelines which advocate for high efficacy statins rather than LDL-c goals for five patient subgroups at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is critical that clinicians have an approach for managing side-effects of statin therapy. Statins are associated with myopathy, transaminase elevations, and an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus among some patients; connections between statins and other processes, such as renal and neurologic function, have also been studied with mixed results. Statin-related adverse effects might be minimized by careful assessment of patient risk factors. Strategies to continue statin therapy despite adverse effects include switching to another statin at a lower dose and titrating up, giving intermittent doses of statins, and adding non-statin agents. Non-statin lipid-lowering drugs have their own unique limitations. Management strategies and algorithms for statin-associated toxicities are available to help guide clinicians. Clinical practice should emphasize tailoring therapy to address each individual's cholesterol goals and risk of developing adverse effects on lipid-lowering drugs."

BACKGROUND: The abundance of gene expression microarray data has led to the development of machine learning algorithms applicable for tackling disease diagnosis, disease prognosis, and treatment selection problems. However, these algorithms often produce classifiers with weaknesses in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces fuzzy support vector machine which is a learning algorithm based on combination of fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines for microarray classification. RESULTS: Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the interpretable rule-base inferred from fuzzy support vector machine helps extracting biological knowledge from microarray data. CONCLUSIONS: Fuzzy support vector machine as a new classification model with high generalization power, robustness, and good interpretability seems to be a promising tool for gene expression microarray classification."

Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5). A preceding screening transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with an aortic diameter of 3.2 cm; at the time of moyamoya diagnosis, the aorta was 3.5 cm with mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. Four years later, the patient had had an acute aortic dissection, Stanford type A, which was repaired successfully. This case report is the third individual with TS associated with moyamoya disease and the first associated with dissection. The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV).

In these populations, research efforts and high-level medical services resulted in intense improvements of medical care and in organization of population-based screening programs. Hereditary disorders of the Roma populations are known for a long time. The genetic background of these diseases has been established by extensive molecular genetic studies. The Romas represent 6% of the Hungarian population and live under extremely bad health conditions. Therefore, our aim was to map the incidence of the hereditary neuromuscular disorders among the Hungarian Roma population. Moreover, we intended to provide proper information, genetic counseling and possible prevention strategies for the families at risk, which should represent a primer task in public health. Because of our experience in neuromuscular disorders, we choose six, frequent, autosomal recessive disorders for these clinical and genetic studies: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Lom (HMSNL), hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Russe (HMSNR), congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism syndrome (CCFDN), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2C (LGMD2C), congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion \u03b2-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens.

Kinetochores assemble at the centromeric DNA organized by specialized centromeric nucleosomes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, which typically have large repetitive centromeric regions, budding yeast CEN DNA is defined by a 125 bp sequence and assembles a single centromeric nucleosome. In budding yeast, as well as in other eukaryotes, the Cse4 histone variant (known in vertebrates as CENP-A) is believed to substitute for histone H3 at the centromeric nucleosome. However, the exact composition of the CEN nucleosome remains a subject of debate. We report the use of a novel ChIP approach to reveal the composition of the centromeric nucleosome and its localization on CEN DNA in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed a strong interaction of H3, as well as Cse4, H4, H2A, and H2B, but not histone chaperone Scm3 (HJURP in human) with the centromeric DNA. H3 localizes to centromeric DNA at all stages of the cell cycle. Using a sequential ChIP approach, we could demonstrate the co-occupancy of H3 and Cse4 at the CEN DNA. Our results favor a H3-Cse4 heterotypic octamer at the budding yeast centromere. Whether or not our model is correct, any future model will have to account for the stable association of histone H3 with the centromeric DNA."

First, we automatically categorize the data into subsets based on its semantic properties and extract candidate PPI pairs from these subsets. Second, we apply support vector machines (SVMs) to classify candidate PPI pairs using features specific for each subset. We obtain promising results on five benchmark datasets: AIMed, BioInfer, HPRD50, IEPA and LLL with F-scores ranging from 60% to 84%, which are comparable with the state-of-the-art PPI extraction systems. Furthermore, our system achieves the best performance on cross-corpora evaluation and comparative performance in terms of computational efficiency.

The mutations were found to segregate as heterozygotes in the maternal and the paternal lineage, respectively. None of the heterozygotes exhibited clinical long QT syndrome (LQTS). No hearing defects were found in the proband. The data strongly indicates that the compound heterozygosity for R518X and A525T is the cause of an autosomal recessive form of RWS in this family. Our findings support the implication of a higher frequency of gene carriers than previously expected. We suggest that relatives of 'sporadic RWS' patients should be considered potential carriers, at risk of dying suddenly from drug-induced LQTS."

OBJECTIVES: Entacapone is a highly potent, reversible, peripherally acting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used as an adjunct to L-dopa in the treatment of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Nevertheless, the consequence of the long-lasting inhibition of COMT by entacapone has never been investigated. We assessed the variation of the soluble red blood cell (S-RBC)-COMT activity after 3 months of chronic treatment by entacapone. METHODS: Twelve consecutive white PD patients (3 women and 9 men; mean age, 65.7 \u00b1 2.4 years) with L-dopa-related motor fluctuations were assessed. Entacapone 200 mg was given in combination with each scheduled L-dopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose (range, 3-5 doses daily). The S-RBC-COMT activity was determined both before entacapone administration (baseline) and twice, respectively, after 1 and 3 months treatment with entacapone, that is, on morning, after at least a 12-hour withdrawal of entacapone and L-dopa and before the following first daily administration. RESULTS: Mean baseline S-RBC-COMT activity was 0.72 \u00b1 0.09 pmol/min per milligram (range, 0.30-1.29 pmol/min per milligram) of protein. After 3 months, the level increased significantly in all PD patients from 0.72 \u00b1 0.09 pmol/min per milligram (range, 0.30-1.29 pmol/min per milligram) to 1.19 \u00b1 0.13 pmol/min per milligram (range, 0.58-2.14 pmol/min per milligram) of protein (P < 0.01), which corresponds to a mean increase of 72.9 \u00b1 9.2% (range, 24%-146%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a long-lasting inhibition of the COMT may limit the efficacy of entacapone by development of a tolerance. Moreover, one may assume that an abrupt withdrawal of the treatment will be followed by a dramatic worsening of motor disability."

A3G and A3F are known to be efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions by binding to 7SL RNA through the Gag NC domain; however, the packaging mechanisms of other APOBEC3 proteins are poorly defined. We have now demonstrated that APOBEC3C (A3C) can be efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions that are deficient for viral genomic RNA. Inhibition of the encapsidation of 7SL RNA into HIV-1 virions blocked the packaging of A3G, but not A3C. While the NC domain is required for efficient packaging of A3G, deletion of this domain had little effect on A3C packaging into HIV-1 Gag particles. A3C interacted with HIV-1 Gag which was MA domain-dependent and RNA-dependent. Deletion of the MA domain of HIV-1 Gag inhibited A3C but not A3G packaging into HIV-1 Gag particles. Thus, A3G and A3C have evolved to use distinct mechanisms for targeting retroviruses."

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B."

Although it was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965, there is no formal definition of NPH, causing discrepancy in its incidence in various studies. This ranges from 2 to 20 per million per year. It is estimated to be the cause of about 5% of cases of dementia and is one of the few reversible causes of dementia. Early diagnosis increases the rate of success to treatment. This makes accurate diagnosis and identification of responders to treatment important. There have been various studies on NPH in the general population, but not much has been said about it in long-term care facilities and the question arises on how many cases are missed. If a screening tool is in place to identify possible cases then further workup could be done to confirm the diagnosis and determine the need for shunting."

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene transcription and play pivotal roles in various biological processes such as development, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. Identifying cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes is a crucial step in understanding gene regulatory networks. To this end, we have used a comparative genomics approach to identify putative cis-regulatory elements associated with TF-encoding genes in vertebrates. DESCRIPTION: We have created a database named TFCONES (Transcription Factor Genes & Associated COnserved Noncoding ElementS) (http://tfcones.fugu-sg.org) which contains all human, mouse and fugu TF-encoding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) associated with them. The CNEs were identified by gene-by-gene alignments of orthologous TF-encoding gene loci using MLAGAN. We also predicted putative transcription factor binding sites within the CNEs. A significant proportion of human-fugu CNEs contain experimentally defined binding sites for transcriptional activators and repressors, indicating that a majority of the CNEs may function as transcriptional regulatory elements. The TF-encoding genes that are involved in nervous system development are generally enriched for human-fugu CNEs. Users can retrieve TF-encoding genes and their associated CNEs by conducting a keyword search or by selecting a family of DNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: The conserved noncoding elements identified in TFCONES represent a catalog of highly prioritized putative cis-regulatory elements of TF-encoding genes and are candidates for functional assay."

Ehrlichia ruminantium is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen which causes heartwater, a serious tick-borne disease of ruminants throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The development of promising recombinant vaccines has been reported previously, but none has been as effective as immunisation with live organisms. In this study we have used reverse vaccinology to identify proteins that elicit an in vitro cellular immune response similar to that induced by intact E. ruminantium. The experimental strategy involved four successive steps: (i) in silico selection of the most likely vaccine candidate genes from the annotated genome; (ii) cloning and expression of the selected genes; (iii) in vitro screening of the expressed proteins for their ability to induce interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production in E. ruminantium-immune lymphocytes; and (iv) further examination of the cytokine response profiles of those lymphocytes which tested positive for IFN-\u03b3 induction. Based on their overall cytokine induction profiles the recombinant proteins were divided into four distinct groups. Eleven recombinant proteins induced a cytokine profile that was similar to the recall immune response induced by immune peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with intact E. ruminantium. This response comprised the upregulation of cytokines associated with adaptive cellular immune responses as well as innate immunity. A successful vaccine may therefore need to contain a combination of recombinant proteins which induce both immune pathways to ensure protection against heartwater."

Oncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in murine fibroblasts initiates a senescence-like cell cycle arrest that depends on the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway. To investigate whether p53 is sufficient to induce senescence, we introduced a conditional murine p53 allele (p53(val135)) into p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and examined cell proliferation and senescence in cells expressing p53, oncogenic Ras, or both gene products. Conditional p53 activation efficiently induced a reversible cell cycle arrest but was unable to induce features of senescence. In contrast, coexpression of oncogenic ras or activated mek1 with p53 enhanced both p53 levels and activity relative to that observed for p53 alone and produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest that displayed features of cellular senescence. p19(ARF) was required for this effect, since p53(-/-) ARF(-/-) double-null cells were unable to undergo senescence following coexpression of oncogenic Ras and p53. Although the levels of exogenous p53 achieved in ARF-null cells were relatively low, the stabilizing effects of p19(ARF) on p53 could not explain the cooperation between oncogenic Ras and p53 in promoting senescence. Hence, enforced p53 expression without oncogenic ras in p53(-/-) mdm2(-/-) double-null cells produced extremely high p53 levels but did not induce senescence. Taken together, our results indicate that oncogenic activation of the MAP kinase pathway in murine fibroblasts converts p53 into a senescence inducer through both quantitative and qualitative mechanisms."

BACKGROUND: Oesophageal achalasia is well-recognized but relatively rare in children, occasionally appearing as the \"triple A\" syndrome (with adrenal insufficiency and alacrima). Treatment modalities, as in adult practice, are not curative, often needing further interventions and spurring the search for better management. The outcome for syndromic variants is unknown. We sought to define the efficacy of treatments for children with achalasia with and without triple A syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of presentation and outcomes for 42 children with achalasia presenting over three decades to a major pediatric referral center. Long term impact of the diagnosis was assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: We identified 42 children including six with triple A syndrome. The median overall age at diagnosis was 10.8 years and median follow-up 1593 days. Initial Heller myotomy in 17 required further interventions in 11 (65%), while initial treatment with botulinum toxin (n = 20) was ultimately followed by myotomy in 17 (85%). Ten out of 35 patients who underwent myotomy required a repeat myotomy (29%). Patients with triple A syndrome developed symptoms earlier, but had delayed diagnosis, were more underweight at diagnosis and at last follow up. Questionnaire results suggested a significant long term deleterious impact on the quality of life of children and their families. CONCLUSION: Many children with achalasia relapse after initial treatment, undergoing multiple, different procedures, despite which symptoms persist and impact on quality of life. Symptoms develop earlier in patients with triple A syndrome, but the diagnosis is delayed and this has substantial nutritional impact."

Newer agents which include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have recently or will soon be available and may provide an improved efficacy in stroke prevention, an improved safety profile, and improved user-friendliness. Dabigatran was the first of the agents to be widely available, and in the RE-LY study, dabigatran (150 mg dose) showed superiority to warfarin in preventing ischemic stroke and a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding. Rivaroxaban was studied in the ROCKETAF trial, and with once daily dosing, it showed noninferiority to warfarin in preventing stroke with a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding. The ARISTOTLE trial showed apixaban was superior to warfarin for stroke prevention, significantly reduced all major bleeding, and resulted in a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. While all three trials have important limitations, they were very large randomized trials with more than 14,000 patients each and show a clear overall net clinical benefit when compared with warfarin. Key features of the drugs as well as an individual's preferences and stability on warfarin will help guide the ultimate drug choice for any given patient, but these newer anticoagulant agents are likely to usher in a new era in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation."

VKORC1 and CYP2C9 variability associated with altered warfarin response is less well characterized in African and mixed-raced populations such as Brazilians. To determine genetic variability associated with altered warfarin response among Brazilian patients, sixty-two adult patients with extreme resistance or sensitivity to warfarin were genotyped for variants in CYP2C9 and VKORC1. Of the 51 patients on low doses of warfarin, the VKORC1--1639 (3673) G>A polymorphism associated with warfarin sensitivity was present in 48 (94.1%), including 97% of Caucasians, 82% of African-descent patients, and all 7 (100%) patients of Indian descent. Additionally, 52.9% of warfarin sensitive patients had at least one CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 decreased metabolism allele, 63.6% of Caucasians and 54% of African-descent patients. Of the 11 patients on high doses of warfarin, sequencing of VKORC1 revealed a nonsynonymous V66M mutation in two warfarin resistant patients, both of African-descent. Brazilian patients requiring low doses of warfarin have a high frequency of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 variants associated with warfarin sensitivity. The presence of the rare VKORC1 V66M in two warfarin high dose outlier patients implies that this variant may be more frequent among African Brazilians and has implications for future warfarin studies in other populations of African descent."

Herein, we have studied 29 case subjects of common and rare de novo ROBs to determine their parental origins and timing of formation. We compared these case subjects to 35 published case subjects of common ROBs and found that most common ROBs apparently have the same breakpoints and arise mainly during oogenesis (50/54). These probably form through a common mechanism and have been termed \"class 1.\" Collectively, rare ROBs also occur mostly during oogenesis (7/10) but probably arise through a more \"random\" mechanism or a variety of mechanisms and have been termed \"class 2.\" Thus, we demonstrate that although both classes of ROBs occur predominantly during meiosis, the common, class 1 ROBs occur primarily during oogenesis and likely form through a mechanism distinct from that forming class 2 ROBs."

BACKGROUND: The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomes. Most of the meiotic segregation studies of human Robertsonian translocations have been performed on common t(13;14) and t(14;21) translocations. Analysis of the chromosomal constitution in sperm of Robertsonian translocation carriers is of great interest for assessing the risk of unbalanced forms and adapting genetic counselling. In the present study, we present the first meiotic segregation study of a t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation in human sperm. METHODS: A total of 11 787 sperm nuclei were scored using two distinct FISH labelling techniques, i.e. the locus-specific probes (LSI) method and the whole chromosome painting (WCP) technique. RESULTS: The frequency of normal or balanced sperm resulting from alternate meiotic segregation was 86%. Incidences of unbalanced complements resulting from adjacent segregation modes were 12.79% and 14.36% in LSI and WCP assays, respectively. No significant excess of nullisomy or disomy for the affected chromosomes was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Similar results in segregation were obtained with the two techniques, demonstrating the efficiency of the two strategies for the direct segregation analysis of Roberstsonian translocations. The results obtained indicated a moderate meiotic production of imbalance. This study shows that the rare Robertsonian translocation (13;22) displays a similar distribution of balanced and unbalanced sperm patterns as the common Robertsonian translocations previously studied. This suggests that the behaviour of acrocentric chromosomes was similar in all cases of centric fusion."

Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the cardiovascular and renal systems are interdependent. Primary disorders of either system have been shown to disturb the other system. As a result, a class of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) has been identified where in a vicious cycle is established in which acute/chronic dysfunction of either the kidney or the heart exacerbates the loss of function in the other organ. The ADQI organization has proposed a classification derived from a consensus conference held in 2008. CRS is classified as a disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other. The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. A major problem with previous terminology was that it did not allow for identification of pathophysiological interactions occurring in the different types of combined heart/kidney disorders. The subdivision into different subtypes seems to provide a better approach to this syndrome."

This phase I study assessed the safety and potential benefit of combined treatment with matuzumab and standard-dose gemcitabine. Three groups of chemotherapy-naive advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (n=17) received escalating doses of matuzumab (400 mg weekly, 800 mg biweekly, or 800 mg weekly) and gemcitabine (1000 mg m-2 weekly in weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle). Toxicity, antitumour activity, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in skin biopsies were evaluated. Severe treatment-related toxicities were limited to grade 3 neutropenia (n=3), leucopenia (n=1), and decreased white blood cell count (n=1). Common study drug-related adverse events were skin toxicities (grade 2=6, grade 1=7) and fever (grade 1=4). Matuzumab inhibited phosphorylated EGFR and affected receptor-dependent signalling and transduction; effects were seen even in the lowest-dose group. Pharmacokinetic data were consistent with results of matuzumab monotherapy. Partial response (PR) or stable disease occurred in eight of 12 evaluated patients (66.7%), with three PRs among six evaluated patients in the group receiving 800 mg weekly. Matuzumab in biologically effective doses with standard gemcitabine therapy appears well tolerated. The combination is feasible and may have enhanced activity."

RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR/Cas, enable targeted genome engineering in cells and organisms. RGENs are ribonucleoproteins that consist of guide RNA and Cas9, a protein component originated from Streptococcus pyogenes. These enzymes cleave chromosomal DNA, whose sequence is complementary, to guide RNA in a targeted manner, producing site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the repair of which gives rise to targeted genome modifications. Despite broad interest in RGEN-mediated genome editing, these nucleases are limited by off-target mutations and unwanted chromosomal translocations associated with off-target DNA cleavages. Here, we show that off-target effects of RGENs can be reduced below the detection limits of deep sequencing by choosing unique target sequences in the genome and modifying both guide RNA and Cas9. We found that both the composition and structure of guide RNA can affect RGEN activities in cells to reduce off-target effects. RGENs efficiently discriminated on-target sites from off-target sites that differ by two bases. Furthermore, exome sequencing analysis showed that no off-target mutations were induced by two RGENs in four clonal populations of mutant cells. In addition, paired Cas9 nickases, composed of D10A Cas9 and guide RNA, which generate two single-strand breaks (SSBs) or nicks on different DNA strands, were highly specific in human cells, avoiding off-target mutations without sacrificing genome-editing efficiency. Interestingly, paired nickases induced chromosomal deletions in a targeted manner without causing unwanted translocations. Our results highlight the importance of choosing unique target sequences and optimizing guide RNA and Cas9 to avoid or reduce RGEN-induced off-target mutations."

In recent years, the treatment of Parkinson's disease has undergone an immense amount of research, resulting in the development of multiple new medications. This has largely been fuelled by dissatisfaction over the development of motor complications secondary to long term levodopa therapy. Different treatment approaches are applied depending on the stage of Parkinson's disease. In early and mild Parkinson's disease, selegiline offers a limited symptomatic effect. Its neuroprotective effect, although at present theoretical, has questionable clinical relevance. Increased mortality associated with selegiline has been reported, although a meta-analysis of 5 different trials did not support this finding. The newer, non-ergoline dopamine agonists, pramipexole and ropinirole, have undergone extensive studies to evaluate their efficacy as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease. These newer agonists are ideal initial symptomatic medications, primarily because they delay the onset of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations. Efficacy of the newer dopamine agonists in advanced disease seems to be comparable to that of the older agents, bromocriptine and pergolide. Adverse effects can be reduced by starting the medication at a very low dose and then slowly titrating upward. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of motor fluctuations in advanced disease, particularly the 'wearing-off' phenomenon. Tolcapone, a peripheral and central COMT inhibitor, appears to be quite effective, producing a 47% reduction in 'off' time. Unfortunately, 3 deaths have been observed, which are presumably secondary to tolcapone therapy. The drug has been withdrawn in many countries, and liver enzyme testing is mandatory in the US. Entacapone, a purely peripheral COMT inhibitor with a lower potency than tolcapone, has also proved to be effective and has not been associated with liver damage, obviating the need for testing."

In the trials with active comparator arms, pembrolizumab regimens significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rates (ORR) relative to ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve patients (KEYNOTE 006), and significantly improved PFS and ORR, but not OS (although OS data are immature), relative to chemotherapy in ipilimumab-refractory patients, who had also received BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy if BRAF-mutation positive (KEYNOTE 002).

Both complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members: mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKC\u03b1 (protein kinase C\u03b1) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2 components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex. Moreover, Protor knockout mice display no defects in the phosphorylation of Akt and PKC\u03b1 at their hydrophobic or turn motifs. Strikingly, we observed that Protor-1 knockout mice displayed markedly reduced hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of SGK1 and its physiological substrate NDRG1 (N-Myc downregulated gene 1) in the kidney. Taken together, these results suggest that Protor-1 may play a role in enabling mTORC2 to efficiently activate SGK1, at least in the kidney."

          "context": "Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes - an update. BACKGROUND: Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) constitute one of the smallest subgroups of sSMC in general. Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome. In 2008 we speculated that complex sSMC could be part of an underestimated entity. RESULTS: Here, the overall yet reported 412 complex sSMC are summarized. They constitute 8.4% of all yet in detail characterized sSMC cases. The majority of the complex sSMC is contributed by patients suffering from Emanuel syndrome (82%). Besides there are a der(22)t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.1) and a der(13)t(13;18)(q11;p11.21) or der(21)t(18;21)(p11.21;q11.1) = der(13 or 21)t(13 or 21;18) syndrome. The latter two represent another 2.6% and 2.2% of the complex sSMC-cases, respectively. The large majority of complex sSMC has a centric minute shape and derives from an acrocentric chromosome. Nonetheless, complex sSMC can involve material from each chromosomal origin. Most complex sSMC are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non-mosaic. Interestingly, there are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved. CONCLUSIONS: Complex sSMC need to be considered in diagnostics, especially in non-mosaic, centric minute shaped sSMC. As yet three complex-sSMC-associated syndromes are identified. As recurrent breakpoints in the complex sSMC were characterized, it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of sSMC. Overall, complex sSMC emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses, especially in patients with idiopathic mental retardation."

The product of the c-myc proto-oncogene (c-Myc) is involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a transcription factor that recognizes the CACGTG motif. This sequence has also been found in the glucose-responsive elements of genes involved in the control of liver glycolysis and lipogenesis. To determine whether c-Myc can regulate hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in vivo, transgenic mice that overexpress c-myc under control of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene promoter have been generated. These mice showed a threefold increase in c-Myc protein in liver nuclei. Hepatocytes from transgenic mice were normal and did not acquire the fetal phenotype. However, transgenic mice showed higher levels (threefold) of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA and enzyme activity than control mice. The increase in pyruvate kinase activity led to a three- to fivefold increase in liver lactate content and a fivefold induction of lactate production by hepatocytes in primary culture. The expression of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase gene was also increased in the liver of these transgenic mice. The induction of hepatic glycolysis was related with an increase in the expression (about fourfold) and activity (about threefold) of liver glucokinase, whereas no change was noted in hexokinase-I. This change in glucokinase activity led to an increase in both glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen contents in the liver of transgenic mice. The expression of the liver-specific glucose transporter GLUT2 was also increased in transgenic mice, whereas no change was noted in the mRNA concentration of GLUT1. Furthermore, the changes of liver glucose metabolism led to a marked reduction of blood glucose (25%) and insulin (40%) concentrations in starvation, whereas the fall in both was only 10% in fed mice. Thus, liver glucose metabolism could determine the blood glucose and insulin set points in the transgenic mice. All these results indicated that the increase in c-Myc protein was able to induce liver glucose utilization and accumulation, and suggested that c-Myc transcription factor is involved in the control in vivo of liver carbohydrate metabolism."

The MORF4-Related Gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15) is a member of a novel family of genes originally identified in studies to reveal cell senescence-inducing factors. MRG15 contains several predicted protein motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a helix-loop-helix region, a leucine zipper, and a chromodomain. These motifs are commonly associated with transcription factors, suggesting that MRG15 may likewise function as a transcriptional regulator. To examine the potential function(s) of MRG15, we sought to identify cellular factors associated with this MRG family member. In this regard, we have found that both the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) and a novel nuclear protein PAM14 (Protein Associated with MRG, 14 kDa) specifically associate with MRG15. We have further demonstrated that these interactions require the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of MRG15. Interestingly we have found all three proteins present in a multiprotein complex, suggesting that at least some of their functions may be interdependent. Although the functions of PAM14 have yet to be elucidated, Rb has several well characterized activities, including repression of E2F-activated promoters such as that of B-myb. Significantly we have demonstrated that MRG15 blocks the Rb-induced repression of this promoter, leading to B-myb promoter activation. Collectively these results suggest that MRG15 regulates transcription through interactions with a cellular protein complex containing Rb and PAM14."

Most of them encode subunits of axonemal dyneins, highlighting the importance of dynein motors to ciliary motility.

Genes encoding the dynein heavy chain of cytoplasmic and outer arm axonemal dyneins are reported to have similar sequences in their central and 3'-end regions.

The cellular abundance of selected identified interactors was investigated by Western blotting. Furthermore, one candidate gene was sequenced in 46 patients with atypical PD. In addition to two known binding partners (HSP90, CDC37), 12 proteins were identified using the TAP assay; four of which are mitochondrially localized (GRP75, HSP60, LRPPRC, and TUFM). Western blot analysis showed no differences in cellular abundance of these proteins comparing PINK1 mutant and control fibroblasts. When sequencing LRPPRC, four exonic synonymous changes and 20 polymorphisms in noncoding regions were detected.

The four-principles approach, as espoused by Beauchamp and Childress, is also interpreted through the prism of Islamic ethical theory. Each of the four principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence,justice and autonomy) is investigated in turn, looking in particular at the extent to which each is rooted in the Islamic paradigm. This will provide an important insight into Islamic medical ethics, enabling the clinician to have a better informed discussion with the Muslim patient. It will also allow for a higher degree of concordance in consultations and consequently optimise culturally sensitive healthcare delivery."

Oncogene-induced senescence is an important mechanism by which normal cells are restrained from malignant transformation. Here we report that the suppression of the c-Myc (MYC) oncogene induces cellular senescence in diverse tumor types including lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. MYC inactivation was associated with prototypical markers of senescence, including acidic beta-gal staining, induction of p16INK4a, and p15INK4b expression. Moreover, MYC inactivation induced global changes in chromatin structure associated with the marked reduction of histone H4 acetylation and increased histone H3 K9 methylation. Osteosarcomas engineered to be deficient in p16INK4a or Rb exhibited impaired senescence and failed to exhibit sustained tumor regression upon MYC inactivation. Similarly, only after lymphomas were repaired for p53 expression did MYC inactivation induce robust senescence and sustained tumor regression. The pharmacologic inhibition of signaling pathways implicated in oncogene-induced senescence including ATM/ATR and MAPK did not prevent senescence associated with MYC inactivation. Our results suggest that cellular senescence programs remain latently functional, even in established tumors, and can become reactivated, serving as a critical mechanism of oncogene addiction associated with MYC inactivation."

We have investigated the possibility that calsequestrin is a luminal calcium concentration sensor for the ryanodine receptor. We measured the luminal calcium concentration at which calsequestrin dissociates from the ryanodine receptor and the effect of calsequestrin on the response of the ryanodine receptor to changes in luminal calcium. We provide electrophysiological and biochemical evidence that: 1), luminal calcium concentration of >/=4 mM dissociates calsequestrin from junctional face membrane, whereas in the range of 1-3 mM calsequestrin remains attached; 2), the association with calsequestrin inhibits ryanodine receptor activity, but amplifies its response to changes in luminal calcium concentration; and 3), under physiological calcium conditions (1 mM), phosphorylation of calsequestrin does not alter its ability to inhibit native ryanodine receptor activity when the anchoring proteins triadin and junctin are present. These data suggest that the quaternary complex is intact in vivo, and provides further evidence that calsequestrin is involved in the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling pathway and has a role as a luminal calcium sensor for the ryanodine receptor."

After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells transition from axon myelination to a demyelinated state that supports neuronal survival and ultimately remyelination of axons. Reprogramming of gene expression patterns during development and injury responses is shaped by the actions of distal regulatory elements that integrate the actions of multiple transcription factors. We used ChIP-seq to measure changes in histone H3K27 acetylation, a mark of active enhancers, to identify enhancers in myelinating rat peripheral nerve and their dynamics after demyelinating nerve injury. Analysis of injury-induced enhancers identified enriched motifs for c-Jun, a transcription factor required for Schwann cells to support nerve regeneration. We identify a c-Jun-bound enhancer in the gene for Runx2, a transcription factor induced after nerve injury, and we show that Runx2 is required for activation of other induced genes. In contrast, enhancers that lose H3K27ac after nerve injury are enriched for binding sites of the Sox10 and early growth response 2 (Egr2/Krox20) transcription factors, which are critical determinants of Schwann cell differentiation. Egr2 expression is lost after nerve injury, and many Egr2-binding sites lose H3K27ac after nerve injury. However, the majority of Egr2-bound enhancers retain H3K27ac, indicating that other transcription factors maintain active enhancer status after nerve injury. The global epigenomic changes in H3K27ac deposition pinpoint dynamic changes in enhancers that mediate the effects of transcription factors that control Schwann cell myelination and peripheral nervous system responses to nerve injury."

It includes five stages and has previously been rarely reported. IRVAN syndrome is especially rare in Asia. In this report, we describe laser diagnosis and therapy in an Asian patient with IRVAN syndrome over two years of follow-up. We observed non-perfusion retina and dilated retinal capillaries in the contralateral eye. Photocoagulation is an effective therapy to control retinal macroaneurysms and nonperfusions and to prevent visual loss, particularly in the early stages of IRVAN syndrome (stages 2 & 3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term observation of photocoagulation in IRVAN syndrome. We discovered the early signs of such lesions, which may be beneficial for clinical diagnosis and therapy."

AJs connect the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton and comprise classic transmembrane cadherins, such as P-cadherin, armadillo family proteins, and actin microfilaments. Loss-of-function mutations in CDH3, which encodes P-cadherin, result in two allelic autosomal recessive disorders: hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM) syndromes. Both syndromes feature sparse hair heralding progressive macular dystrophy. EEM syndrome is characterized in addition by ectodermal and limb defects. Recent studies have demonstrated that, together with its involvement in cell-cell adhesion, P-cadherin plays a crucial role in regulating cell signaling, malignant transformation, and other major intercellular processes. Here, we review the roles of P-cadherin in skin and hair biology, with emphasize on human hair growth, cycling and pigmentation."

Since dovitinib is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and targets brain tumor-relevant pathways, we conducted a phase I trial to demonstrate its safety in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with first or second GBM recurrence started treatment with the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) previously established in systemic cancer patients (500\u00a0mg/d, 5\u00a0days on/2\u00a0days off). A modified 3\u00a0+\u00a03 design in three cohorts (500, 400, 300\u00a0mg) was used. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled. Seventy-two adverse events (AEs) occurred and 16.7\u00a0% of AEs were classified as > CTC grade 3 toxicity, mainly including hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity. Only one out of six patients of the 300-mg cohort showed grade 3 toxicity. The PFS-6 rate was 16.7\u00a0%, and it was not associated with detection of the FGFR-TACC gene fusion in the tumor. CONCLUSION: Dovitinib is safe in patients with recurrent GBM and showed efficacy in only some patients unselected for target expression. The recommended phase II dose of 300\u00a0mg would be substantially lower than the recently established MTD in systemic cancer patients. Further personalized trials are recommended."

Growth cones at the distal tips of growing nerve axons contain bundles of actin filaments distributed throughout the lamellipodium and that project into filopodia. The regulation of actin bundling by specific actin binding proteins is likely to play an important role in many growth cone behaviors. Although the actin binding protein, fascin, has been localized in growth cones, little information is available on its functional significance. We used the large growth cones of the snail Helisoma to determine whether fascin was involved in temporal changes in actin filaments during growth cone morphogenesis. Fascin localized to radially oriented actin bundles in lamellipodia (ribs) and filopodia. Using a fascin antibody and a GFP fascin construct, we found that fascin incorporated into actin bundles from the beginning of growth cone formation at the cut end of axons. Fascin associated with most of the actin bundle except the proximal 6--12% adjacent to the central domain, which is the region associated with actin disassembly. Later, during growth cone morphogenesis when actin ribs shortened, the proximal fascin-free zone of bundles increased, but fascin was retained in the distal, filopodial portion of bundles. Treatment with tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which phosphorylates fascin and decreases its affinity for actin, resulted in loss of all actin bundles from growth cones. Our findings suggest that fascin may be particularly important for the linear structure and dynamics of filopodia and for lamellipodial rib dynamics by regulating filament organization in bundles."

BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) is an inflammatory disorder caused by mutations in any of six genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR). The disease is severe and effective treatments are urgently needed. We investigated the status of interferon-related biomarkers in patients with AGS with a view to future use in diagnosis and clinical trials. METHODS: In this case-control study, samples were collected prospectively from patients with mutation-proven AGS. The expression of six interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by quantitative PCR, and the median fold change, when compared with the median of healthy controls, was used to create an interferon score for each patient. Scores higher than the mean of controls plus two SD (>2\u00b7466) were designated as positive. Additionally, we collated historical data for interferon activity, measured with a viral cytopathic assay, in CSF and serum from mutation-positive patients with AGS. We also undertook neutralisation assays of interferon activity in serum, and looked for the presence of autoantibodies against a panel of interferon proteins. FINDINGS: 74 (90%) of 82 patients had a positive interferon score (median 12\u00b790, IQR 6\u00b714-20\u00b741) compared with two (7%) of 29 controls (median 0\u00b793, IQR 0\u00b757-1\u00b730). Of the eight patients with a negative interferon score, seven had mutations in RNASEH2B (seven [27%] of all 26 patients with mutations in this gene). Repeat sampling in 16 patients was consistent for the presence or absence of an interferon signature on 39 of 41 occasions. Interferon activity (tested in 147 patients) was negatively correlated with age (CSF, r=-0\u00b7604; serum, r=-0\u00b7289), and was higher in CSF than in serum in 104 of 136 paired samples. Neutralisation assays suggested that measurable antiviral activity was related to interferon \u03b1 production. We did not record significantly increased concentrations of autoantibodies to interferon subtypes in patients with AGS, or an association between the presence of autoantibodies and interferon score or serum interferon activity. INTERPRETATION: AGS is consistently associated with an interferon signature, which is apparently sustained over time and can thus be used to differentiate patients with AGS from controls. If future studies show that interferon status is a reactive biomarker, the measurement of an interferon score might prove useful in the assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials.

Auxin plays a pivotal role in various plant growth and development processes, including vascular differentiation. The modulation of auxin responsiveness through the auxin perception and signaling machinery is believed to be a major regulatory mechanism controlling cambium activity and wood formation. To gain more insights into the roles of key Aux/IAA gene regulators of the auxin response in these processes, we identified and characterized members of the Aux/IAA family in the genome of Eucalyptus grandis, a tree of worldwide economic importance. We found that the gene family in Eucalyptus is slightly smaller than that in Populus and Arabidopsis, but all phylogenetic groups are represented. High-throughput expression profiling of different organs and tissues highlighted several Aux/IAA genes expressed in vascular cambium and/or developing xylem, some showing differential expression in response to developmental (juvenile vs. mature) and/or to environmental (tension stress) cues. Based on the expression profiles, we selected a promising candidate gene, EgrIAA4, for functional characterization. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Overexpressing a stabilized version of EgrIAA4 in Arabidopsis dramatically impeded plant growth and fertility and induced auxin-insensitive phenotypes such as inhibition of primary root elongation, lateral root emergence and agravitropism. Interestingly, the lignified secondary walls of the interfascicular fibers appeared very late, whereas those of the xylary fibers were virtually undetectable, suggesting that EgrIAA4 may play crucial roles in fiber development and secondary cell wall deposition."

This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands. The precision of the predictions was found to be 80% with a recall of 88% when tested on the proteins with SwissProt annotated subcellular localization in Escherichia coli K 12 (788 sequences) and Salmonella typhimurium (366 sequences). When tested on the predicted proteome of E.coli, BOMP found 103 of a total of 4346 polypeptide sequences to be possible integral beta-barrel proteins. Of these, 36 were found by BLAST to lack similarity (E-value score < 1e-10) to proteins with annotated subcellular localization in SwissProt.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal white matter visible by brain imaging.

We mapped tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH) to 10q22.3-23.1 in French-Canadian families and sequenced candidate genes within this interval. Two missense and one insertion mutations in five individuals with TACH were uncovered in POLR3A, which codes for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Because these families were mapped to the same locus as leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) and presented clinical and radiological overlap with individuals with hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome, we sequenced this gene in nine individuals with 4H and eight with LO. In total, 14 recessive mutations were found in 19 individuals with TACH, 4H, or LO, establishing that these leukodystrophies are allelic. No\u00a0individual was found to carry two nonsense mutations. Immunoblots on 4H fibroblasts and on the autopsied brain of an individual diagnosed with 4H documented a significant decrease in POLR3A levels, and there was a more significant decrease in the cerebral white\u00a0matter compared to that in the cortex. Pol III has a wide set of target RNA transcripts, including all nuclear-coded tRNA. We hypothesize that the decrease in POLR3A leads to dysregulation of the expression of certain Pol III targets and thereby perturbs cytoplasmic protein synthesis. This type of broad alteration in protein synthesis is predicted to occur in other leukoencephalopathies such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3, caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1)."

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders and is the most common inherited neuromuscular disorder, with an estimated overall prevalence of 17-40/10,000. Although there has been major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of CMT in recent years, the most useful classification is still a neurophysiological classification that divides CMT into type 1 (demyelinating; median motor conduction velocity < 38 m/s) and type 2 (axonal; median motor conduction velocity > 38 m/s). An intermediate type is also increasingly being described. Inheritance can be autosomal-dominant (AD), X-linked, or autosomal-recessive (AR). AD CMT1 is the most common type of CMT and was the first form of CMT in which a causative gene was described. This review provides an up-to-date overview of AD CMT1 concentrating on the molecular genetics as the clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological features have been covered elsewhere. Four genes (PMP22, MPZ, LITAF, and EGR2) have been described in the last 15 yr associated with AD CMTI and a further gene (NEFL), originally described as causing AD CMT2 can also cause AD CMT1 (by neurophysiological criteria). Studies have shown many of these genes, when mutated, can cause a wide range of CMT phenotypes from the relatively mild CMT1 to the more severe Dejerine-Sottas disease and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy, and even in some cases axonal CMT2. This review discusses what is known about these genes and in particular how they cause a peripheral neuropathy, when mutated."

Chronic alcoholics (n = 10) without haemolysis and healthy male persons (n = 10) served as controls. Erythrocytes were separated into old and young cells by means of density-layer centrifugation. Those fractions which contained older red cells disclosed a pyruvate-kinase instability which resulted in impaired metabolism. Changes in membrane lipid composition as indicated by increased cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also detected in patients during the acute phase of ZS. Alcohol-induced red-cell vitamin-E deficiency with a decrease in PUFA levels may provoke an oxidation of reduced red-cell glutathione which in turn results in the enzyme instability.

Moyamoya disease (MIM 252350) is characterized by stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portions of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and by abnormal vascular networks at the base of the brain. There is a high incidence of moyamoya disease in Asia, especially in Japan. Multifactorial inheritance is estimated with lambda(s)>40. Previous linkage studies have indicated that susceptibility loci for the disease are located on chromosomes 3p, 6q, and 17q. In the present study, we searched for loci linked to the disease in 12 Japanese families using 428 microsatellite markers and found significant evidence for linkage to 8q23 [maximum LOD score (MLS) of 3.6] and suggestive evidence for linkage to 12p12 (MLS=2.3). The present study revealed a novel locus for moyamoya disease."

MOTIVATION: Transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins are embedded in the outer membranes of mitochondria, Gram-negative bacteria and chloroplasts. These proteins perform critical functions, including active ion-transport and passive nutrient intake. Therefore, there is a need for accurate prediction of secondary and tertiary structure of TMB proteins. Traditional homology modeling methods, however, fail on most TMB proteins since very few non-homologous TMB structures have been determined. Yet, because TMB structures conform to specific construction rules that restrict the conformational space drastically, it should be possible for methods that do not depend on target-template homology to be applied successfully. RESULTS: We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation. Using the transFold dataset TMBpro predicts secondary structure with per-residue accuracy (Q(2)) of 77.8%, a correlation coefficient of 0.54, and TMBpro predicts beta-contacts with precision of 0.65 and recall of 0.67. Using the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts secondary structure with Q(2) of 88.3% and a correlation coefficient of 0.75. All of these performance results exceed previously published results by 4% or more. Working with the PRED-TMBB dataset, TMBpro predicts the tertiary structure of transmembrane segments with RMSD <6.0 A for 9 of 14 proteins. For 6 of 14 predictions, the RMSD is <5.0 A, with a GDT_TS score greater than 60.0. AVAILABILITY: http://www.igb.uci.edu/servers/psss.html."

Recent studies have highlighted several genes subject to natural selection in native high-altitude Tibetans. Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions. Uncovering the molecular basis of hypoxic adaptation should have implications for understanding hematological and other adaptations involved in hypoxia tolerance. Because the hypoxia response involves a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic functions, this knowledge would improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and could ultimately be translated into targeted therapies for oxygen deprivation, cardiopulmonary and cerebral pathologies, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity."

BACKGROUND: The Demons-Meigs syndrome should usually be evoked in case of presence of a typical triad: abdominopelvic mass, ascites and hydrothorax. Its diagnosis appears crucial to prevent the realization of unnecessary surgical procedures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman presented in April 2012 to the emergency department of our maternity unit (General Hospital, Thiers, France) with an abdominal distension mimicking the symptoms of a pregnancy at term. Physical examination revealed a voluminous painful abdominopelvic mass, extended from the pelvis to the upper abdomen with a large right pleural effusion. Ultrasound and computed tomography showed it was a tumor measuring more than 300 mm in diameter with a right hydrothorax. Serum CA-125 level was 289 U/ml. Cytologic analysis of the pleural effusion didn't show any malignant cells. In this study, Demons-Meigs syndrome was recognized. A laparoscopico-laparotomic management permitted an aspiration of 23 liters of a brownish liquid and an unilateral adnexectomy after pleural paracentesis was performed. Frozen section demonstrated benign mucinous cystadenoma. The final histologic findings objectified intracystic intestinal type ovarian mucinous borderline tumor. After multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was re-operated one month later. The exploration didn't reveal any suspected lesions and appendectomy and omentectomy were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Serum CA-125 level was normal at the time of the reoperation and 24 months after the initial surgery. CONCLUSION: The preoperative recognition of a Demons-Meigs syndrome or a Demons' pseudosyndrome is essential to avoid useless surgical procedures."

Transcription regulation in multicellular eukaryotes is orchestrated by a number of DNA functional elements located at gene regulatory regions. Some regulatory regions (e.g. enhancers) are located far away from the gene they affect. Identification of distal regulatory elements is a challenge for the bioinformatics research. Although existing methodologies increased the number of computationally predicted enhancers, performance inconsistency of computational models across different cell-lines, class imbalance within the learning sets and ad hoc rules for selecting enhancer candidates for supervised learning, are some key questions that require further examination. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data. We report the first computational enhancer prediction results on FANTOM5 data where DEEP achieves 90.2% accuracy and 90% geometric mean (GM) of specificity and sensitivity across 36 different tissues. We further present results derived using in vivo-derived enhancer data from VISTA database. DEEP-VISTA, when tested on an independent test set, achieved GM of 80.1% and accuracy of 89.64%.

It is still unknown how catecholamine synthesis is regulated in pheochromocytomas. As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands. The TH mRNA level was overexpressed and the catecholamine contents were high in 4 out of 6 pheochromocytomas. There was a close correlation between the TH mRNA level and the catecholamines content in the tumors. We also examined the gene expression of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in pheochromocytomas. The expression of these genes was in parallel with that of TH mRNA in the tumors. These findings indicate that catecholamine overproduction in pheochromocytomas is mediated by the overexpression of genes coding for catecholamines synthesizing enzymes, TH, DBH, and AADC."

Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone-associated tumor of children and young adults. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS/FLI fusion protein. EWS/FLI functions as an aberrant ETS-type transcription factor and serves as the master regulator of Ewing's sarcoma-transformed phenotype. We recently showed that EWS/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Whether other critical EWS/FLI targets are also regulated by GGAA-microsatellites was unknown. In this study, we combined transcriptional analysis, whole genome localization data, and RNA interference knockdown to identify glutathione S-transferase M4 (GSTM4) as a critical EWS/FLI target gene in Ewing's sarcoma. We found that EWS/FLI directly binds the GSTM4 promoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Reduction of GSTM4 levels caused a loss of oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma whose tumors had higher levels of GSTM4 expression had worse outcomes than those with lower expression levels. These data show that GSTM4 contributes to the cancerous behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and define a wider role for GGAA-microsatellites in EWS/FLI function than previously appreciated. These data also suggest a novel therapeutic resistance mechanism, in which the central oncogenic abnormality directly regulates a resistance gene."

METHODS: Patients underwent detailed ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal examination. This was correlated with Sanger sequencing of ADAMTSL4 and FBN1 genes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were examined, including one with ectopia lentis et pupillae. Echocardiography and skeletal examination revealed no sign of systemic disorders associated with EL, in particular Marfan syndrome (MFS). Nine patients (52.9%) were found to have mutations in ADAMTSL4, including four novel nonsense mutations. Four patients (25%) were found to have novel FBN1 mutations, not previously reported as causing classical Marfan syndrome. One additional patient was found to have an FBN1 mutation previously reported in classical MFS. Four patients (25%) were found to have no mutations in either gene. Median age of diagnosis of EL was 35 years in patients with FBN1 mutations and 2 years in patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations (P < 0.01). Mean axial length was 22.74 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.3-24.2) (FBN1) and 27.54 mm (95% CI: 24.2-30.9) (ADAMTSL4) (P < 0.01). Other ophthalmic features, including corneal thickness and power, foveal thickness, visual acuity, and direction of lens displacement, were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: ADAMTSL4 is the most important known causative gene in isolated EL. Mutations in ADAMTSL4 appear to cause earlier manifestation of EL and are associated with increased axial length as compared to FBN1. We suggest that ADAMTSL4 be screened in all patients with isolated EL and that physicians be vigilant for the more severe ocular phenotype associated with mutations in this gene."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the rates of concomitant use of drugs known to interact with warfarin by increasing the prothrombin time expressed as the international normalized ratio (INR), decreasing the INR, or increasing bleeding risk without apparent changes in INR in a cohort of patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Large pharmacy benefits manager database. PATIENTS: A total of 134,833 patients who were prescribed long-term warfarin from June 1, 1999-May 31, 2000. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Longitudinal pharmacy claims from the pharmacy benefits manager database were reviewed to identify coprescription of warfarin and drugs associated with significant interactions with warfarin. Of the 134,833 patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, 109,998 (81.6%) were prescribed a concurrent prescription for at least one potentially interacting drug, including 87,346 (64.8%) who were prescribed one or more concomitant drugs associated with interactions known to increase the INR. Acetaminophen-containing products, prescribed for 22.7% of patients receiving concomitant prescriptions, and thyroid hormones, prescribed for 17.5%, were the most commonly prescribed concurrent drugs associated with an increased INR response. The most frequently prescribed interacting agents associated with a decreased INR response were trazodone (2.2%) and carbamazepine (1.1%). The most commonly prescribed agents independently associated with increased bleeding risk were cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Many patients receiving warfarin therapy are treated with concomitant drugs that may interact with the warfarin. The high percentage of patients taking drugs that may increase INR or bleeding risk is a reminder that bleeding events are a likely adverse outcome of combining drugs that interact with warfarin. Careful warfarin management is necessary to avoid adverse events associated with drug interactions."

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial program for the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors that involves loss of cell-cell adhesion and increased cell mobility; however, mechanisms underlying this transition are not fully elucidated. Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. We found that forced expression of SIRT1 in non-transformed PZ-HPV-7 prostate epithelial cells disrupts the epithelial morphology concomitant with decreased expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell-cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells. We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. Specifically, we show that SIRT1 silencing reduces expression of ZEB1 and that SIRT1 is recruited to the E-cadherin proximal promoter by ZEB1 to deacetylate histone H3 and to reduce binding of RNA polymerase II, ultimately suppressing E-cadherin transcription. We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT. Finally, we show that reduction of SIRT1 decreases prostate cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo in immunodeficient mice, which is largely independent of any general effects of SIRT1 on prostate cancer growth and survival. We therefore identify SIRT1 as a positive regulator of EMT and metastatic growth of prostate cancer cells and our findings implicate overexpressed SIRT1 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse EMT and to prevent prostate cancer progression."

Adult skeletal muscle is a very stable tissue containing a small population of myofiber-associated quiescent satellite cells compared with late embryonic/neonatal skeletal muscle, which contains highly proliferating myoblasts and small actively growing myofibers, suggesting that specific regulatory pathways may control myogenesis at distinct developmental stages. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway is central for myogenesis, based on studies using immortalized and neonatal primary myoblasts in vitro. However, the contribution of this pathway to adult myogenesis has never been investigated. Four p38 isoforms (p38alpha, p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta) exist in mammalian cells, being p38alpha and p38gamma the most abundantly expressed isoforms in adult skeletal muscle. Given the embryonic/neonatal lethality of p38alpha-deficient mice, here we investigate the relative contribution of p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta to adult myogenesis. Regeneration and myofiber growth of adult muscle proceeds with similar efficiency in mice lacking p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta as in wild-type control mice. In agreement with this, there is no difference in adult primary myoblasts behavior in vitro among the different genotypes. Importantly, the pattern of p38 activation (ascribed to p38alpha) remains unperturbed during satellite cell-mediated myogenesis in vitro and adult muscle regeneration in wild type and p38beta-, p38gamma- and p38delta-deficient mice, rendering p38alpha as the essential p38 isoform sustaining adult myogenesis. This study constitutes the first analysis addressing the functionality of p38beta, p38gamma and p38delta in satellite cell-dependent adult muscle regeneration and growth."

The binding properties of a series of benzenesulfonamide inhibitors (4-substituted-ureido-benzenesulfonamides, UBSAs) of human carbonic anhydrase II (hCA II) enzyme with active site residues have been studied using a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) model. To account for the important docking interactions between the UBSAs ligand and hCA II enzyme, a molecular docking program AutoDock Vina is used. The molecular docking results obtained by AutoDock Vina revealed that the docked conformer has root mean square deviation value less than 1.50 \u00c5 compared to X-ray crystal structures. The inhibitory activity of UBSA ligands against hCA II is found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The thermodynamic parameters for inhibitor binding show that hydrogen bonding, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic interactions play a major role in explaining the diverse inhibitory range of these derivatives. Additionally, natural bond orbital analysis is performed to characterize the ligand-metal charge transfer stability. The insights gained from this study have great potential to design new hCA-II inhibitor, 4-[3-(1-p-Tolyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-ureido]-benzenesulfonamide, which belongs to the family of UBSA inhibitors and shows similar type of inhibitor potency with hCA II.

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical trials, pharmacologic characteristics, safety, and efficacy of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir single tablet formulation (Stribild). DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE (1948-September 2012) and PubMed (1966-September 2012) using the search terms GS-9137, elvitegravir, GS 9350, cobicistat, quad pill, Stribild, and integrase inhibitors. Abstracts from HIV/AIDS conferences were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stribild were preferentially evaluated, as well as relevant references from the published studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Stribild contains complete antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection in a single tablet. It is the first once-daily therapy option available with an integrase inhibitor and a novel pharmacokinetic boosting agent. Stribild has shown noninferiority in viral load suppression at 48 weeks when compared with dual nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor and either a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen. Stribild was well tolerated, but some patients experienced increases in serum creatinine early in treatment that stabilized over time. CONCLUSIONS: Stribild is the first single-tablet regimen for HIV-1 infection treatment containing an integrase inhibitor. It is expected to have a prominent place in the formularies of health plans providing care for individuals with HIV-1 infection."

The French Epirubicin Study Group. The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients. Patients were stratified according to whether or not there were bone metastases only. Four hundred twelve patients entered this trial; 378 were assessable for tolerability and 365 for efficacy. The overall response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%), but both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006, respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance. No difference in survival was observed between epirubicin- and FEC 50-group patients, even though the response rate was significantly worse in the monochemotherapy group."

OBJECTIVE: We report a detailed description of a family affected by a hereditary multisystem disorder associated with moyamoya syndrome. METHODS: In this family case report, we evaluated 9 members of the same family originating from Algeria. Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17. RESULTS: Five males related through a maternal lineage were affected, suggesting an X-linked inheritance. Four of them had symptomatic moyamoya syndrome with an onset of acute neurologic manifestations between 4 and 32 years. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, azoospermia, short stature of postnatal onset (-2 to -4 SD in adulthood), premature graying of hair, and dysmorphism were present in all patients. The other features of the disease included early cataract in 4, dilated cardiomyopathy in 3, and partial growth hormone deficiency in 2 members. Muscle biopsy data did not reveal signs of a mitochondrial disorder. All conditions known to be associated with moyamoya syndrome such as Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and sickle cell disease were excluded. We also excluded linkage to the 2 loci previously reported to be involved in autosomal dominant syndromic and nonsyndromic moyamoya. Carrier females had normal phenotype and clinical history. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest that this family is affected by a hereditary moyamoya multisystem disorder with X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance."

Plasmids of this family, which show a modular organization, are functional in evolutionarily diverse bacterial species of the Firmicutes Phylum. This review summarizes our understanding, accumulated during the last 20 years, on the genetics, biochemistry, cytology and physiology of the five pSM19035 segregation (seg) loci, which map outside of the minimal replicon. The segA locus plays a role both in maximizing plasmid random segregation, and in avoiding replication fork collapses in those plasmids with long inverted repeated regions. The segB1 locus, which acts as the ultimate determinant of plasmid maintenance, encodes a short-lived epsilon(2) antitoxin protein and a long-lived zeta toxin protein, which form a complex that neutralizes zeta toxicity. The cells that do not receive a copy of the plasmid halt their proliferation upon decay of the epsilon(2) antitoxin. The segB2 locus, which encodes two trans-acting, ParA- and ParB-like proteins and six cis-acting parS centromeres, actively ensures equal or roughly equal distribution of plasmid copies to daughter cells. The segC locus includes functions that promote the shift from the use of DNA polymerase I to the replicase (PolC-PolE DNA polymerases). The segD locus, which encodes a trans-acting transcriptional repressor, omega(2), and six cis-acting cognate sites, coordinates the expression of genes that control copy number, better-than-random segregation and partition, and assures the proper balance of these different functions. Working in concert the five different loci achieve almost absolute plasmid maintenance with a minimal growth penalty."

One hallmark of Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumors is the presence of the Ews/Fli-1 chimeric oncogene. Interestingly, infection of neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with Ews/Fli-1 switches the differentiation program of neuroblastomas to Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumors. Here we examined the status of cytoplasmically sequestered wt-p53 in neuroblastomas after stable expression of Ews/Fli-1. Immunofluorescence revealed that in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines, p53 went from a punctate-pattern of cytoplasmic sequestration to increased nuclear localization. Western blot analysis revealed that PARC was down-regulated in one neuroblastoma cell line but not expressed in the second. Therefore, decreased PARC expression could not fully account for relieving p53 sequestration in the neuroblastoma tumor cells. Neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines showed marked increases in p53 protein expression without transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, p53 was primarily phosphorylated, without activation of its downstream target p21(WAF1). Western blot analysis revealed that whereas MDM2 gene expression does not change, p14(ARF), a negative protein regulator of MDM2, increases. These observations suggest that the downstream p53 pathway may be inactivated as a result of abnormal p53. We also found that p53 has an extended half-life in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants despite the retention of a wild-type sequence in neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines. We then tested the p53 response pathway and observed that the neuroblastoma parent cells responded to genotoxic stress, whereas the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants did not. These results suggest that Ews/Fli-1 can directly abrogate the p53 pathway to promote tumorigenesis. These studies also provide additional insight into the relationship among the p53 pathway proteins."

Prior clinical reports revealed phenotypic variability ranging from the absence of symptoms to syncope among KCNQ1 G325R mutation carriers. The present study was designed to determine the G325R ion channel phenotype and its association with the clinical LQTS presentation. Electrophysiological testing was performed using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. KCNQ1 G325R channels were non-functional and suppressed wild type (WT) currents by 71.1%.

          "context": "Identification of repurposed small molecule drugs for chordoma therapy. Chordoma is a rare, slow growing malignant tumor arising from remnants of the fetal notochord. Surgery is the first choice for chordoma treatment, followed by radiotherapy, although postoperative complications remain significant. Recurrence of the disease occurs frequently due to the anatomy of the tumor location and violation of the tumor margins at the initial surgery. Currently, there are no effective drugs available for patients with chordoma. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is limited opportunity to test agents in clinical trials and no concerted effort to develop agents for chordoma in the pharmaceutical industry. To rapidly and efficiently identify small molecules that inhibit chordoma cell growth, we screened the NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) containing approximately 2800 clinically approved and investigational drugs at 15 different concentrations in chordoma cell lines, U-CH1 and U-CH2. We identified a group of drugs including bortezomib, 17-AAG, digitoxin, staurosporine, digoxin, rubitecan, and trimetrexate that inhibited chordoma cell growth, with potencies from 10 to 370 nM in U-CH1 cells, but less potently in U-CH2 cells. Most of these drugs also induced caspase 3/7 activity with a similar rank order as the cytotoxic effect on U-CH1 cells. Cantharidin, digoxin, digitoxin, staurosporine, and bortezomib showed similar inhibitory effect on cell lines and 3 primary chordoma cell cultures. The combination treatment of bortezomib with topoisomerase I and II inhibitors increased the therapeutic potency in U-CH2 and patient-derived primary cultures. Our results provide information useful for repurposing currently approved drugs for chordoma and potential approach of combination therapy."

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases are rare disorders whose prevalence is estimated around 1 in 5000. Patients are usually tested only for deletions and for common mutations of mtDNA which account for 5-40% of cases, depending on the study. However, the prevalence of rare mtDNA mutations is not known. METHODS: We analysed the whole mtDNA in a cohort of 743 patients suspected of manifesting a mitochondrial disease, after excluding deletions and common mutations. Both heteroplasmic and homoplasmic variants were identified using two complementary strategies (Surveyor and MitoChip). Multiple correspondence analyses followed by hierarchical ascendant cluster process were used to explore relationships between clinical spectrum, age at onset and localisation of mutations. RESULTS: 7.4% of deleterious mutations and 22.4% of novel putative mutations were identified. Pathogenic heteroplasmic mutations were more frequent than homoplasmic mutations (4.6% vs 2.8%). Patients carrying deleterious mutations showed symptoms before 16 years of age in 67% of cases. Early onset disease (<1 year) was significantly associated with mutations in protein coding genes (mainly in complex I) while late onset disorders (>16 years) were associated with mutations in tRNA genes. MTND5 and MTND6 genes were identified as 'hotspots' of mutations, with Leigh syndrome accounting for the large majority of associated phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Rare mitochondrial DNA mutations probably account for more than 7.4% of patients with respiratory chain deficiency. This study shows that a comprehensive analysis of mtDNA is essential, and should include young children, for an accurate diagnosis that is now accessible with the development of next generation sequencing technology."

          "context": "signeR: an empirical Bayesian approach to mutational signature discovery. MOTIVATION: Mutational signatures can be used to understand cancer origins and provide a unique opportunity to group tumor types that share the same origins and result from similar processes. These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task. RESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge.

Misregulation of c-Abl, as seen in the constitutively active BCR-ABL, is the leading cause of human chronic myeloid leukemia. However, how the Abl proteins execute their functions still remains largely unknown. Here, we report an important role for c-Abl in replicative senescence and immortalization by regulating the expression of two tumor suppressors that induce cellular senescence, p53 and p16(INK4a). Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we show that c-Abl (-/-) cells were more resistant to immortalization than wildtype cells using a standard 3T3 or 3T9 protocol. We could only immortalize three out of nine c-Abl (-/-) MEF cultures even when we increased the number of starting cells. This resistance was attributed to premature senescence and reduced survival in senescent c-Abl (-/-) cells due to an increase in p16(INK4a) and p53 expression. Deleting p53 allows c-Abl (-/-) p53 (-/-) MEFs to bypass senescence to be spontaneously immortalized. Cell immortalization, but not senescence, was generally accompanied by mutations in p53 in both wildtype and c-Abl (-/-) MEFs, although the spectrum is different from that of human tumors. The role for c-Abl in regulating cell senescence and immortalization might explain some of the developmental defects in c-Abl (-/-) mice and how BCR-ABL transforms cells."

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. METHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum eosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were instructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled glucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for 12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary end point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points included a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52 patients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with dupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction with dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28; P<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung function and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with Th2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and headache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when LABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA (miRNA) is an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs that act as gene regulators. Recent studies have suggested that miRNA deregulation is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancer. However, information about cancer-related miRNA is mostly limited to tissue miRNA. The aim of this study was to find specific profiles of serum-derived miRNAs of ovarian cancer based on a comparative study using a miRNA microarray of serum, tissue, and ascites. METHODS: From 2 ovarian cancer patients and a healthy control, total RNA was isolated from their serum, tissue, and ascites, respectively, and analyzed by a microarray. Under the comparative study of each miRNA microarray, we sorted out several miRNAs showing a consistent regulation tendency throughout all 3 specimens and the greatest range of alteration in serum as potential biomarkers. The availability of biomarkers was confirmed by qRT-PCR of 18 patients and 12 controls. RESULTS: Out of 2222 kinds of total miRNAs that were identified in the microarray analysis, 95 miRNAs were down-regulated and 88 miRNAs were up-regulated, in the serum, tissue, and ascites of cancer patients. Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls. Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145) out of 5 selected miRNAs were significantly underexpressed in the serum of ovarian cancer patients in qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer. Also, serum miRNAs is a promising and useful tool for discriminating between controls and patients with serous ovarian cancer."

In budding yeast, a single right-handed cenH3/H4/H2A/H2B tetramer wraps the \u223c80-bp Centromere DNA Element II (CDE II) sequence of each centromere into a 'hemisome'. However, attempts to reconstitute cenH3 particles in vitro have yielded exclusively 'octasomes', which are observed in vivo on chromosome arms only when Cse4 (yeast cenH3) is overproduced. Here, we show that Cse4 octamers remain intact under conditions of low salt and urea that dissociate H3 octamers. However, particles consisting of two DNA duplexes wrapped around a Cse4 octamer and separated by a gap efficiently split into hemisomes. Hemisome dimensions were confirmed using a calibrated gel-shift assay and atomic force microscopy, and their identity as tightly wrapped particles was demonstrated by gelFRET. Surprisingly, Cse4 hemisomes were stable in 4 M urea. Stable Cse4 hemisomes could be reconstituted using either full-length or tailless histones and with a 78-bp CDEII segment, which is predicted to be exceptionally stiff. We propose that CDEII DNA stiffness evolved to favor Cse4 hemisome over octasome formation. The precise correspondence between Cse4 hemisomes resident on CDEII in vivo and reconstituted on CDEII in vitro without any other factors implies that CDEII is sufficient for hemisome assembly."

Primary pedigree analysis revealed that offspring from female patients were at the highest risk to be affected by LVNC (15/18, 83.3%) while LVNC was absent in offspring of male LVNC patients (0/8). Moreover, clinical heart failure symptoms and arrhythmias were more severe in female LVNC patients than in male LVNC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by cardiac rhythm disorders. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia in adult population [1, 2]. According to some of the large epidemiological studies diabetes mellitus is among independent risk factors for development and persistence of atrial fibrillation [3]. Both diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation independently increase the risk of thromboembolism, especially of stroke [3-5]. It is obvious that rhythm control, i.e. restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, may be essential for prevention of thromboembolism in these patients. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of diabetes mellitus on rhythm control in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus and other clinical and echocardiographic parameters (age, gender, current arrhythmia duration, presence of previous episodes of persistent atrial fibrillation, cardiac and/or noncardiac diseases, left atrial diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction) on outcome of attempted cardioversion in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation admitted to Cardiologic Department of the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, between January 1992 and December 1999. We also analysed retrospectively the impact of diabetes mellitus and other parameters listed above on the presence of previous episodes of atrial fibrillation in our patients, that at our opinion reflected the possibilities of sinus rhythm maintenance in these patients. All continuous parameters were expressed as mean value and standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences between variables was examined using Chi-square test. For identification of independent predictors of examined outcomes we used multiple logistic regression model with 95% of confidence interval. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programme. RESULTS: Of 378 patients with currently persistent atrial fibrillation, aged mean 53.98 +/- 11.69 years, there were 266 (70.4%) men. Diabetes mellitus was previously diagnosed in 27 (7.1%) patients, cardiac diseases in 223 (59.0%), noncardiac diseases in 47 (12.4%) and 140 (37.0%) patients had \"lone\" atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was noted in 224 (59.3%) patients, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 82 (21.7%). Atrial fibrillation lasted 48 hours to 9 years, mean 8.5 +/- 18.14 months before cardioversion. While 43 patients had previous episodes of persistent AF for last 1-30 years, mean 10.5 +/- 7.3,335 patients never experienced AF before. There was a statistically significant difference in percent of diabetic patients (18.6%/43 vs. 5.7%/335, value of Chi-square test = 7.759, p < 0.01) in these two groups. We analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome of attempted cardioversion and on presence of previous episodes of AF reflecting the success in maintaining sinus rhythm. Multiple logistic regression models for all of 378 patients, with dependent variable being present in previous recurrent atrial fibrillations and independent variables of clinical and echocardiographic parameters as listed, identified diabetes mellitus to be an independent predictor of repeated atrial fibrillations with relative risk of 4.6 (CI 95%). When dependent variable in the same model was outcome of cardioversion (sinus rhythm is restored in 281/378 patients--74%) diabetes mellitus was not among independent predictors of successful cardioversion. DISCUSSION: The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus is not completely understood, including the impact of known complications of diabetes mellitus on electrophysiological properties of atrial myocardium and development of atrial fibrillation [6]. Besides being the independent risk factor for occurrence of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, according to our results, appears to influence the possibilities of maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of permanent atrial fibrillation in diabetic patients. We found that patients with diabetes mellitus and persistent atrial fibrillation may be successfully converted to sinus rhythm like any other group of patients, but the presence of diabetes mellitus increases the risk of arrhythmia recurrence for 4.6 times compared to patients without diabetes mellitus. Obviously, diabetic patients need to be treated with more efficacious antiarrhythmics from the very beginning, including amiodarone, which successfully prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation in the majority of patients [7, 8]. CONCLUSION: We concluded that diabetes mellitus independently predicts the presence of recurrent atrial fibrillation but does not influence the possibility of sinus rhythm restoration. The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus needs further investigation."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score). However, some patients have strokes despite a low predicted risk according to these scores. We designed the ABCDE+ score by adding the variables 'etiology' and ischaemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) -'DWI-positivity'- to the ABCD-score. We hypothesized that this refinement increases the predictability of recurrent ischaemic events. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study amongst all consecutive TIA patients in a university hospital emergency department. Area under the computed receiver-operating curves (AUCs) were used to compare the predictive values of the scores with regard to the outcome stroke or recurrent TIA within 90 days. RESULTS: Amongst 248 patients, 33 (13.3%, 95%-CI 9.3-18.2%) had a stroke (n = 13) or a recurrent TIA (n = 20). Patients with recurrent ischaemic events more often had large-artery atherosclerosis as the cause for TIA (46% vs. 14%, P < 0.001) and positive DWI (61% vs. 35%; P = 0.01) compared with patients without recurrent events. Patients with and those without events did not differ with regard to age, clinical symptoms, duration, blood pressure, risk factors, and stroke preventive treatment. The comparison of AUCs [95%CI] showed superiority of the ABCDE+ score (0.67[0.55-0.75]) compared to the ABCD(2) -score (0.48[0.37-0.58]; P = 0.04) and a trend toward superiority compared to the ABCD-score (0.50[0.40-0.61]; P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In TIA patients, the addition of the variables 'etiology' and 'DWI-positivity' to the ABCD-score seems to enhance the predictability of subsequent cerebral ischaemic events."

Charophytes is a green algal group closely related to land plants. We investigated the effects of antibiotics that interfere with peptidoglycan biosynthesis on chloroplast division in the desmid Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex. To detect cells just after division, we used colchicine, which inhibits Closterium cell elongation after division. Although normal Closterium cells had two chloroplasts before and after cell division, cells treated with ampicillin, D-cycloserine, or fosfomycin had only one chloroplast after cell division, suggesting that the cells divided without chloroplast division. The antibiotics bacitracin and vancomycin showed no obvious effect. Electron microscopic observation showed that irregular-shaped chloroplasts existed in ampicillin-treated Closterium cells. Because antibiotic treatments resulted in the appearance of long cells with irregular chloroplasts and cell death, we counted cell types in the culture. The results suggested that cells with one chloroplast appeared first and then a huge chloroplast was generated that inhibited cell division, causing elongation followed by cell death."

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the rate of response to matuzumab in patients with recurrent, EGFR-positive ovarian, or primary peritoneal cancer. Secondary end points included safety and tolerability, time to tumor progression, duration of response, and overall survival. METHODS: A multi-institutional single arm phase II trial. RESULTS: Of 75 women screened for the study, 37 were enrolled and treated. Median age of the treated patient population was 58 years, and most patients had more than four prior lines of chemotherapy. Therapy was well tolerated, the most common toxicities being a constellation of skin toxicities, including rash, acne, dry skin, and paronychia, as well as headache, fatigue, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events were very rare but included a single episode of pancreatitis that may have been drug related. All patients completed therapy, receiving 1 to 30 infusions of matuzumab. There were no formal responses (RR=0%, 95% CI: 0-9.5%), although 7 patients (21%) were on therapy for more than 3 months with stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Matuzumab at the dose and schedule selected is well tolerated. In this population of very heavily pretreated patients with epithelial ovarian and primary peritoneal malignancies, there was no evidence of significant clinical activity when matuzumab was administered as monotherapy."

          "context": "SPAG5 as a prognostic biomarker and chemotherapy sensitivity predictor in breast cancer: a retrospective, integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and protein analysis. BACKGROUND: Proliferation markers and profiles have been recommended for guiding the choice of systemic treatments for breast cancer. However, the best molecular marker or test to use has not yet been identified. We did this study to identify factors that drive proliferation and its associated features in breast cancer and assess their association with clinical outcomes and response to chemotherapy. METHODS: We applied an artificial neural network-based integrative data mining approach to data from three cohorts of patients with breast cancer (the Nottingham discovery cohort (n=171), Uppsala cohort (n=249), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium [METABRIC] cohort; n=1980). We then identified the genes with the most effect on other genes in the resulting interactome map. Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) featured prominently in our interactome map of proliferation and we chose to take it forward in our analysis on the basis of its fundamental role in the function and dynamic regulation of mitotic spindles, mitotic progression, and chromosome segregation fidelity. We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), Nottingham early stage oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT; n=697), the Nottingham anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-NeoACT; n=200), the MD Anderson taxane plus anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (MD Anderson-NeoACT; n=508), and the multicentre phase 2 neoadjuvant clinical trial cohort (phase 2 NeoACT; NCT00455533; n=253). FINDINGS: In the METABRIC cohort, we detected SPAG5 gene gain or amplification at the Ch17q11.2 locus in 206 (10%) of 1980 patients overall, 46 (19%) of 237 patients with a PAM50-HER2 phenotype, and 87 (18%) of 488 patients with PAM50-LumB phenotype. Copy number aberration leading to SPAG5 gain or amplification and high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein concentrations were associated with shorter overall breast cancer-specific survival (METABRIC cohort [copy number aberration]: hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b750, 95% CI 1\u00b718-1\u00b792, p=0\u00b700010; METABRIC cohort [transcript]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b740-2\u00b701, p<0\u00b70001; and Nottingham-HES-breast cancer cohort [protein]: 1\u00b768, 1\u00b732-2\u00b712, p<0\u00b70001). In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020). In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b720-0\u00b760, p=0\u00b70010). Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7031). In multivariable analysis, both high SPAG5 transcript and high SPAG5 protein concentrations were independent predictors for a higher proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response after combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: OR 1\u00b771, 95% CI, 1\u00b707-2\u00b774, p=0\u00b7024; Nottingham-ACT: 8\u00b775, 2\u00b742-31\u00b762, p=0\u00b70010). INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.

Owing to the limited regenerative capacity of heart tissue, cardiac regenerative therapy has emerged as an attractive approach. Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose. We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT. In the present study, we sought to determine whether human fibroblasts also could be converted to iCMs by defined factors. Our initial finding that GMT was not sufficient for cardiac induction in HCFs prompted us to screen for additional factors to promote cardiac reprogramming by analyzing multiple cardiac-specific gene induction with quantitative RT-PCR. The addition of Mesp1 and Myocd to GMT up-regulated a broader spectrum of cardiac genes in HCFs more efficiently compared with GMT alone. The HCFs and human dermal fibroblasts transduced with GMT, Mesp1, and Myocd (GMTMM) changed the cell morphology from a spindle shape to a rod-like or polygonal shape, expressed multiple cardiac-specific proteins, increased a broad range of cardiac genes and concomitantly suppressed fibroblast genes, and exhibited spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations. Moreover, the cells matured to exhibit action potentials and contract synchronously in coculture with murine cardiomyocytes. A 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay revealed that the iCMs thus generated do not pass through a mitotic cell state. These findings demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be directly converted to iCMs by defined factors, which may facilitate future applications in regenerative medicine."

The aim of this study is to assess the effects of both quercetin and vitamin C on lipid profile and muscle damage in human subjects. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried out on 60 males for eight weeks. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four groups: 1) quercetin + vitamin C (500 mg/day quercetin + 200 mg/day vitamin C) 2) quercetin (500 mg/day quercetin + 200 mg/day placebo) 3) vitamin C (500 mg/day vitamin C + 200 mg/day placebo) and 4) placebo (500 mg/day placebo + 200 mg/day placebo). Blood samples, body weight and percent of body fat were measured before and after intervention. In addition, dietary intake was estimated using 24-h recall. RESULTS: No significant changes occurred in high-density lipoprotein levels between groups and in the four groups before and after supplementation. Low density lipoprotein values decreased significantly (P = 0.048) in the \"Quercetin + Vit C\" group but decrease was not considerable in other groups before and after intervention and among groups. Fat-soluble vitamins' intake was significantly high among 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin and vitamin C supplementation may not be beneficial in lipid profile improvement, although it may reduce induce muscle damage and body fat percent."

A new approach for the screening of plant extracts was developed based on the ligand fishing experiments and zonal chromatography. For that, the magnetic beads were used for the ligand fishing experiments and capillary bioreactors for the activity assays.

OBJECTIVE: Type I interferon (IFN) is implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and interferonopathies such as Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. A recently discovered DNA-activated type I IFN pathway, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), has been linked to Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome and mouse models of lupus. The aim of this study was to determine whether the cGAS pathway contributes to type I IFN production in patients with SLE. METHODS: SLE disease activity was measured by the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. Expression of messenger RNA for cGAS and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) levels were examined by multiple reaction monitoring with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Expression of cGAS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly higher in SLE patients than in normal controls (n = 51 and n = 20 respectively; P < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between cGAS expression and the IFN score (P < 0.001). The expression of cGAS in PBMCs showed a dose response to type I IFN stimulation in vitro, consistent with it being an ISG. Targeted measurement of cGAMP by tandem mass spectrometry detected cGAMP in 15% of the SLE patients (7 of 48) but none of the normal (0 of 19) or rheumatoid arthritis (0 of 22) controls. Disease activity was higher in SLE patients with cGAMP versus those without cGAMP. CONCLUSION: Increased cGAS expression and cGAMP in a proportion of SLE patients indicates that the cGAS pathway should be considered as a contributor to type I IFN production. Whereas higher cGAS expression may be a consequence of exposure to type I IFN, detection of cGAMP in patients with increased disease activity indicates potential involvement of this pathway in disease expression."

METHODS: We here demonstrate through molecular analysis that EEM is caused by distinct homozygous CDH3 mutations in two previously published families. RESULTS: In family 1, a missense mutation (c.965A-->T) causes a change of amino acid 322 from asparagine to isoleucine; this amino acid is located in a highly conserved motif likely to affect Ca2+ binding affecting specificity of the cell-cell binding function. In family 2, a homozygous frameshift deletion (c.829delG) introduces a truncated fusion protein with a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 295, expected to cause a non-functional protein lacking both its intracellular and membrane spanning domains and its extracellular cadherin repeats 3-5. Our mouse in situ expression data demonstrate that Cdh3 is expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge from E10.5 to E12.5, and later in the interdigital mesenchyme, a pattern compatible with the EEM phenotype. Furthermore, we discuss possible explanations for the phenotypic differences between EEM and congenital hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD), which is also caused by CDH3 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have ascertained a third gene associated with ectrodactyly and have demonstrated a hitherto unrecognised role of CDH3 in shaping the human hand."

Node-negative breast cancer is a prevalent form of the disease worldwide, particularly in regions with rigorous screening and disease awareness efforts. Although there is a common biology between node-negative and node-positive breast tumors, it is still important to specifically address risk assessment and predictive factors in node-negative breast cancer. The relative risks and benefits are more pronounced in these patients, but there is no single prognostic factor available for deciding whether to administer chemotherapy and selecting the best adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. In the absence of universal predictive factors, the trend is to give chemotherapy to all patients to ensure the highest possibility for cure. Tumor grade is important in that it is predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and, consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The oncotype DX\u00ae genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy."

METHODS: Data were extracted from the original reports (study level) and a meta-analysis was carried out. RESULTS: When compared with warfarin, XOAC therapy was associated with a decrease in haemorrhagic stroke, with a similar pattern for all regimens and meta-analysis showing a risk ratio of 0.488 (95% CI 0.396 to 0.601). Regarding total mortality, a favourable pattern was seen for all four regimens and meta-analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.892 (95% CI 0.840 to 0.947). Major bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding provided two examples regarding which heterogeneity would seem to exist, when XOAC drugs are compared with warfarin. In what concerns the incidence of myocardial infarction, the primary end point (stroke plus systemic embolism) and ischaemic stroke, the situation is less clear. These results are inconsistent with a putative 'group effect' for all the seven parameters under study, and for some of them it would probably be best to look at each of the individual trial data rather than at the meta-analysis data (which seem to lack a clear biological meaning). CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban have shown interesting effects, when compared with warfarin in clinical trials, in patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly with regard to haemorrhagic stroke and to the mortality rate. No other consistent conclusions concerning a putative 'group effect' can be reached at the present stage. Concerns regarding adherence to therapy, possible drug interactions, cost and current absence of antidotes may be taken into consideration when choosing an anticoagulant drug."

Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \"mutation signatures\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5' to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \"mixed-membership models\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature_shiny/."

The waist circumference cut point for diagnosing the metabolic syndrome in sub-Saharan African subjects is based on that obtained from studies in European populations. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of obesity and related metabolic disorders in an urban population of African females, a group at high risk for such diseases, and to determine the appropriate waist cut point for diagnosing the metabolic syndrome. Anthropometry and fasting lipid, glucose and insulin levels were measured in a cohort of 1251 African females participating in the Birth to Twenty cohort study in Soweto, Johannesburg. The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome were 50.1%, 14.3% and 42.1%, respectively. The appropriate waist cut point for diagnosing metabolic syndrome was found to be 91.5 cm and was similar to the cuts points obtained for detecting increased risk of insulin resistance (89.0 cm), dysglycaemia (88.4 cm), hypertension (90.1 cm), hypo-high density lipoproteinaemia (87.6 cm) and hyper-low density lipoproteinaemia (90.5 cm). The present data demonstrates that urban, African females have a high prevalence of obesity and related disorders and the waist cut point currently recommended for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome (80.0 cm) in this population should be increased to 91.5 cm. This latter finding demonstrates a clear ethnic difference in the relationship between abdominal adiposity and metabolic disease risk. The similar waist cut points identified for the detection of the individual components of the metabolic syndrome and related cardiovascular risk factors demonstrates that the risk for different metabolic diseases increases at the same level of abdominal adiposity suggesting a common aetiological pathway."

Our previous results indicated that MRG15 (MORF-related gene on chromosome 15) could derepress the B-myb promoter by association with Rb. In this study, sucrose gradient analysis demonstrated that MRG15 was present in two distinct nuclear protein complexes, MAF1 (MRG15-associated factor 1) and MAF2. Rb was associated with MRG15 and PAM14 (a novel coil-coil protein) in MAF1, and a histone acetyl transferase, hMOF, was an MRG15 partner in MAF2. Analysis of deletion mutants of MRG15 indicated that the leucine zipper at the C-terminal region of MRG15 was important for the protein associations in MAF1 and that the N-terminal chromodomain was required for the assembly of the MAF2 protein complex. Consistent with these data was the fact that a histone acetyltransferase activity associated with MRG15 was lost when the chromodomain was deleted and that both mutant MRG15 proteins failed to activate the B-myb promoter. The various mechanisms by which MRG15 could activate gene transcription are discussed."

All patients presenting to Gosford or Wyong Hospital ED with TIA, for whom faxed referrals to the neurology department were received between October 2008 and July 2010, were included in this prospective cohort study. Classification of low risk was based on an age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score <4 and the absence of high risk features, including known carotid disease, crescendo TIA, or atrial fibrillation. Patients with ABCD2 scores > or =4 or with high risk features were discussed with the neurologist on call (a decision regarding discharge or admission was then made at the neurologist's discretion). Patients were investigated with a brain CT scan and/or CT angiography, routine pathology, and an electrocardiogram. All discharged patients were commenced on antiplatelet therapy and asked to follow up with their local medical officer within 7 days. The patients were contacted by the neurology department to arrange follow-up. Our primary outcome was the number of subsequent strokes occurring within 90 days. Of 200 discharged patients for whom referrals were received, three patients had a stroke within 90 days. None of these would have been prevented through hospitalisation. In conclusion, medical assessment, expedited investigation with immediate commencement of secondary prevention and outpatient neurology review may be a reasonable alternative to admission for low risk patients presenting to the ED with TIA."

Molecular analysis of a number of NF1 specific tumours has shown the inactivation of both NF1 alleles during tumourigenesis, in accordance with Knudson's \"two hit\" hypothesis. We have studied 82 tumours from 45 NF1 patients. Two separate strategies were used in this study to search for the somatic changes involved in the formation of NF1 tumours. First, evidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the NF1 gene region was investigated, and, second, a screen for the presence of sequence alterations was conducted on a large panel of DNA derived from matched blood/tumour pairs. In this study, the largest of its kind to date, we found that 12% of the tumours (10/82) exhibited LOH; previous studies have detected LOH in 3-36% of the neurofibromas examined. In addition, an SSCP/HA mutation screen identified five novel NF1 germline and two somatic mutations. In a plexiform neurofibroma from an NF1 patient, mutations in both NF1 alleles have been characterised."

DNA methyltransferase 3B (Dnmt3b) belongs to a family of enzymes responsible for methylation of cytosine residues in mammals. DNA methylation contributes to the epigenetic control of gene transcription and is deregulated in virtually all human tumors. To better understand the generation of cancer-specific methylation patterns, we genetically inactivated Dnmt3b in a mouse model of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis. Ablation of Dnmt3b function using a conditional knockout in T cells accelerated lymphomagenesis by increasing cellular proliferation, which suggests that Dnmt3b functions as a tumor suppressor. Global methylation profiling revealed numerous gene promoters as potential targets of Dnmt3b activity, the majority of which were demethylated in Dnmt3b-/- lymphomas, but not in Dnmt3b-/- pretumor thymocytes, implicating Dnmt3b in maintenance of cytosine methylation in cancer. Functional analysis identified the gene Gm128 (which we termed herein methylated in normal thymocytes [Ment]) as a target of Dnmt3b activity. We found that Ment was gradually demethylated and overexpressed during tumor progression in Dnmt3b-/- lymphomas. Similarly, MENT was overexpressed in 67% of human lymphomas, and its transcription inversely correlated with methylation and levels of DNMT3B. Importantly, knockdown of Ment inhibited growth of mouse and human cells, whereas overexpression of Ment provided Dnmt3b+/+ cells with a proliferative advantage. Our findings identify Ment as an enhancer of lymphomagenesis that contributes to the tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3b and suggest it could be a potential target for anticancer therapies."

Disease gene prioritization aims to suggest potential implications of genes in disease susceptibility. Often accomplished in a guilt-by-association scheme, promising candidates are sorted according to their relatedness to known disease genes. Network-based methods have been successfully exploiting this concept by capturing the interaction of genes or proteins into a score. Nonetheless, most current approaches yield at least some of the following limitations: (1) networks comprise only curated physical interactions leading to poor genome coverage and density, and bias toward a particular source; (2) scores focus on adjacencies (direct links) or the most direct paths (shortest paths) within a constrained neighborhood around the disease genes, ignoring potentially informative indirect paths; (3) global clustering is widely applied to partition the network in an unsupervised manner, attributing little importance to prior knowledge; (4) confidence weights and their contribution to edge differentiation and ranking reliability are often disregarded. We hypothesize that network-based prioritization related to local clustering on graphs and considering full topology of weighted gene association networks integrating heterogeneous sources should overcome the above challenges. We term such a strategy Interactogeneous. We conducted cross-validation tests to assess the impact of network sources, alternative path inclusion and confidence weights on the prioritization of putative genes for 29 diseases. Heat diffusion ranking proved the best prioritization method overall, increasing the gap to neighborhood and shortest paths scores mostly on single source networks. Heterogeneous associations consistently delivered superior performance over single source data across the majority of methods. Results on the contribution of confidence weights were inconclusive. Finally, the best Interactogeneous strategy, heat diffusion ranking and associations from the STRING database, was used to prioritize genes for Parkinson's disease. This method effectively recovered known genes and uncovered interesting candidates which could be linked to pathogenic mechanisms of the disease."

It also catalyzes poly(A) degradation in vitro, even though this property has been questioned. Caf1 proteins are related to RNase D, a feature supported by the recently published structure of Pop2. Yeast Pop2 contains, however, a divergent active site while its human homologs harbor consensus catalytic residues. Given these differences, we tested whether its deadenylase activity is conserved in the human homologs Caf1 and Pop2. Our data demonstrate that both human factors degrade poly(A) tails indicating their involvement in mRNA metabolism."

BACKGROUND: Exhaled NO (FE(NO)) is a useful biomarker for the monitoring of asthma control and response to therapy. However, there is a lack of data on FE(NO) levels and their interpretation in Primary Care asthma population depending on their treatment and smoking habit. Besides, the majority of current FE(NO) tests have been done by stationary chemiluminescence analysers whose use is limited to research laboratories. METHODS: FE(NO) measurements by the novel hand-held NO monitoring device (NIOX MINO) were made in 96 asthma patients (32 males, mean age 53+/-12) at five local General Practices during their scheduled 15-20 min visits for lung function assessment. RESULTS: Success rate was 78% and the intra-subject coefficient of variation was 8.7%. Inhaled corticosteroid treatment had an overall reducing effect on the FE(NO) value (30.5 [19.8-49.8]) vs. patients not on the ICS (26.5 [19-94]) (p<0.044). FE(NO) levels in the ICS treated current or ex-smokers group of patients were still significantly above the normal values (p<0.0001). FE(NO) levels were similar in patients receiving ICS whether there were current, ex-smokers or non-smokers. The highest FE(NO) levels (94 [15.8-151]) were found in asthmatic current smokers and not receiving treatment with ICS. The most \"normalised\" FE(NO) levels (35.3 [13.5-35.3]) were seen in ex-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: FE(NO) measurements performed with a new hand-held monitoring device are reproducible and feasible in General Practice in the majority of patients of different ages and asthma severities. A high percentage of patients with different severities of asthma and regardless of their treatment with ICS and current smoking habit (current and/or ex-smokers) had highly elevated FE(NO) values, suggesting that their current therapy was possibly insufficient to control the underlying degree of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms."

OBJECTIVE: Pathological gambling is a disabling disorder experienced by approximately 1%-2% of adults and for which there are few empirically validated treatments. The authors examined the efficacy and tolerability of the opioid antagonist nalmefene in the treatment of adults with pathological gambling. METHOD: A 16-week, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 15 outpatient treatment centers across the United States between March 2002 and April 2003. Two hundred seven persons with DSM-IV pathological gambling were randomly assigned to receive nalmefene (25 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 100 mg/day) or placebo. Scores on the primary outcome measure (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling) were analyzed by using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Estimated regression coefficients showed that the 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day nalmefene groups had significantly different scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling, compared to the placebo group. A total of 59.2% of the subjects who received 25 mg/day of nalmefene were rated as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" at the last evaluation, compared to 34.0% of those who received placebo. Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who received nalmefene had a statistically significant reduction in severity of pathological gambling. Low-dose nalmefene (25 mg/day) appeared efficacious and was associated with few adverse events. Higher doses (50 mg/day and 100 mg/day) resulted in intolerable side effects."

While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family."

DNA replication initiates by formation of a pre-replication complex on sequences termed origins. In eukaryotes, the pre-replication complex is composed of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and the MCM replicative helicase in conjunction with Cdt1. Eukaryotic ORC is considered to be composed of six subunits, named Orc1-6, and monomeric Cdc6 is closely related in sequence to Orc1. However, ORC has been little explored in protists, and only a single ORC protein, related to both Orc1 and Cdc6, has been shown to act in DNA replication in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we identify three highly diverged putative T. brucei ORC components that interact with ORC1/CDC6 and contribute to cell division. Two of these factors are so diverged that we cannot determine if they are eukaryotic ORC subunit orthologues, or are parasite-specific replication factors. The other we show to be a highly diverged Orc4 orthologue, demonstrating that this is one of the most widely conserved ORC subunits in protists and revealing it to be a key element of eukaryotic ORC architecture. Additionally, we have examined interactions amongst the T. brucei MCM subunits and show that this has the conventional eukaryotic heterohexameric structure, suggesting that divergence in the T. brucei replication machinery is limited to the earliest steps in origin licensing."

Fluorescent chromatin tagging by the lacO operator/lac repressor system in Arabidopsis thaliana is useful to trace distinct chromatin domains in living cells. Nevertheless, the tandem repeats of the tagging system may alter the spatial organisation of chromatin within nuclei by increasing homologous pairing as well as association with heterochromatin. Efficient homologous pairing occurs if lacO repeat arrays of \u223c10\u00a0kb are present at two loci, either on the same chromosome or on different chromosomes. DNA hypomethylation of lacO repeats results in reduced homologous pairing. Because, in plants, DNA methylation can serve as a signal for H3-lysine9-dimethylation (H3K9me2), and subsequently for non-CG-context DNA methylation, SET-domain histone methyltransferase and chromodomain dna methyltransferase 3 (cmt3) mutations were introgressed. In suvh4 suvh5             suvh6 and cmt3 mutants, H3K9me2 associated with lacO repeats is diminished, but homologous pairing persists. Thus, neither H3K9me2 nor CMT3-mediated non-CG methylation are required at wild-type level for homologous pairing of lacO repeat loci."

Oncogenic activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade in murine fibroblasts initiates a senescence-like cell cycle arrest that depends on the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway. To investigate whether p53 is sufficient to induce senescence, we introduced a conditional murine p53 allele (p53(val135)) into p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and examined cell proliferation and senescence in cells expressing p53, oncogenic Ras, or both gene products. Conditional p53 activation efficiently induced a reversible cell cycle arrest but was unable to induce features of senescence. In contrast, coexpression of oncogenic ras or activated mek1 with p53 enhanced both p53 levels and activity relative to that observed for p53 alone and produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest that displayed features of cellular senescence. p19(ARF) was required for this effect, since p53(-/-) ARF(-/-) double-null cells were unable to undergo senescence following coexpression of oncogenic Ras and p53. Although the levels of exogenous p53 achieved in ARF-null cells were relatively low, the stabilizing effects of p19(ARF) on p53 could not explain the cooperation between oncogenic Ras and p53 in promoting senescence. Hence, enforced p53 expression without oncogenic ras in p53(-/-) mdm2(-/-) double-null cells produced extremely high p53 levels but did not induce senescence. Taken together, our results indicate that oncogenic activation of the MAP kinase pathway in murine fibroblasts converts p53 into a senescence inducer through both quantitative and qualitative mechanisms."

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical trials, pharmacologic characteristics, safety, and efficacy of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir single tablet formulation (Stribild). DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE (1948-September 2012) and PubMed (1966-September 2012) using the search terms GS-9137, elvitegravir, GS 9350, cobicistat, quad pill, Stribild, and integrase inhibitors. Abstracts from HIV/AIDS conferences were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of Stribild were preferentially evaluated, as well as relevant references from the published studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Stribild contains complete antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection in a single tablet. It is the first once-daily therapy option available with an integrase inhibitor and a novel pharmacokinetic boosting agent. Stribild has shown noninferiority in viral load suppression at 48 weeks when compared with dual nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor and either a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen. Stribild was well tolerated, but some patients experienced increases in serum creatinine early in treatment that stabilized over time. CONCLUSIONS: Stribild is the first single-tablet regimen for HIV-1 infection treatment containing an integrase inhibitor. It is expected to have a prominent place in the formularies of health plans providing care for individuals with HIV-1 infection."

With this in mind, it is remarkable that mutations in phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1), which is the most ubiquitously expressed gene of the three PRS genes, are compatible with life. Mutations described thus far in PRPS1 are all missense mutations that result in PRS-I superactivity or in variable levels of decreased activity, resulting in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5 (CMTX5), Arts syndrome, and X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFN2). Patients with PRS-I superactivity primarily present with uric acid overproduction, mental retardation, ataxia, hypotonia, and hearing impairment. Postlingual progressive hearing loss is found as an isolated feature in DFN2 patients. Patients with CMTX5 and Arts syndrome have peripheral neuropathy, including hearing impairment and optic atrophy. However, patients with Arts syndrome are more severely affected because they also have central neuropathy and an impaired immune system. The neurological phenotype in all four PRPS1-related disorders seems to result primarily from reduced levels of GTP and possibly other purine nucleotides including ATP, suggesting that these disorders belong to the same disease spectrum. Preliminary results of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation in two Arts syndrome patients show improvement of their condition, indicating that SAM supplementation in the diet could alleviate some of the symptoms of patients with PRPS1 spectrum diseases by replenishing purine nucleotides (J.C., unpublished data)."

Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. We also show that subsets of GATA-1 gene targets are bound in vivo by distinct complexes, thus linking specific GATA-1 partners to distinct aspects of its functions.

BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by benign tumours in multiple organs, including the brain, kidneys, skin, lungs and heart. Our objective was to evaluate everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, in the treatment of angiomyolipoma in patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC. METHODS: EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 (NCT00789828), a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, examined everolimus in treating SEGA associated with TSC. Patients with serial SEGA growth from pre-baseline to baseline scans were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 4.5 mg/m(2)/day everolimus (target blood trough: 5-15 ng/mL; n = 78) or placebo (n = 39). Angiomyolipoma response rates were analysed in patients (n = 44) with target baseline angiomyolipoma lesions ( > 1 angiomyolipoma; longest diameter > 1.0 cm). An angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed angiomyolipoma response, was assessed by kidney CT or MRI screening at baseline, at 12, 24 and 48 weeks and annually. RESULTS: Angiomyolipoma response rates were 53.3% (16/30) and 0% (0/14) for everolimus- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Angiomyolipoma reductions > 50% in the sum of volumes of all target lesions were seen only in everolimus-treated patients (56.5, 78.3 and 80.0%) compared with placebo-treated patients (0% at each time point) at Weeks 12, 24 and 48, respectively. Greater percentages of everolimus-treated patients had angiomyolipoma reductions > 30% at these same time points (82.6, 100 and 100% versus 8.3, 18.2 and 16.7% for everolimus versus placebo, respectively).

The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate. Northern blot analysis indicates that junctate is expressed in a variety of human tissues including heart, pancreas, brain, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the genetic loci of junctin and junctate map to the same cytogenetic band on human chromosome 8. Analysis of intron/exon boundaries of the genomic BAC clones demonstrate that junctin, junctate, and aspartyl beta-hydroxylase result from alternative splicing of the same gene. The predicted lumenal portion of junctate is enriched in negatively charged residues and is able to bind calcium. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium (45)Ca(2+) binding in the presence of a physiological concentration of KCl demonstrate that junctate binds 21.0 mol of Ca(2+)/mol protein with a k(D) of 217 +/- 20 microm (n = 5). Tagging recombinant junctate with green fluorescent protein and expressing the chimeric polypeptide in COS-7-transfected cells indicates that junctate is located in endoplasmic reticulum membranes and that its presence increases the peak amplitude and transient calcium released by activation of surface membrane receptors coupled to InsP(3) receptor activation.

OBJECTIVE: Pathological gambling is a disabling disorder experienced by approximately 1%-2% of adults and for which there are few empirically validated treatments. The authors examined the efficacy and tolerability of the opioid antagonist nalmefene in the treatment of adults with pathological gambling. METHOD: A 16-week, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 15 outpatient treatment centers across the United States between March 2002 and April 2003. Two hundred seven persons with DSM-IV pathological gambling were randomly assigned to receive nalmefene (25 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 100 mg/day) or placebo. Scores on the primary outcome measure (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling) were analyzed by using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Estimated regression coefficients showed that the 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day nalmefene groups had significantly different scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling, compared to the placebo group. A total of 59.2% of the subjects who received 25 mg/day of nalmefene were rated as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" at the last evaluation, compared to 34.0% of those who received placebo. Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who received nalmefene had a statistically significant reduction in severity of pathological gambling. Low-dose nalmefene (25 mg/day) appeared efficacious and was associated with few adverse events. Higher doses (50 mg/day and 100 mg/day) resulted in intolerable side effects."

The phosphorylation of rat cardiac microsomal proteins was investigated with special attention to the effects of okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases), inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 1 and inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). The results showed that okadaic acid (5 microM) modestly but reproducibly augmented the protein kinase A-catalyzed phospholamban (PLN) phosphorylation, although exerted little effect on the calcium/calmodulin kinase-catalyzed PLN phosphorylation. Microsomes contained three other substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were phosphorylated by protein kinase A but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase. The protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of these three substrates was markedly (2-3 fold) increased by 5 microM okadaic acid. Calmodulin was found to antagonize the action of okadaic acid on such phosphorylation. Protein kinase A inhibitor was found to decrease the protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of microsomal polypeptides. Unexpectedly, inhibitor 2 was also found to markedly decrease protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban as well these other microsomal substrates. These results are consistent with the views that protein phosphatase 1 is capable of dephosphorylating membrane-associated phospholamban when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but not by calcium/calmodulin kinase, and that under certain conditions, calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) is also able to dephosphorylate PLN phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Additionally, the observations show that protein phosphatase 1 is extremely active against the three protein kinase A substrates (M(r) 23, 19 and 17 kDa) that were present in the isolated microsomes and whose state of phosphorylation was particularly affected in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide. Protein phosphatase 2B is also capable of dephosphorylating these three substrates."

Protein geranylgeranylation (GGylation) is an important biochemical process for many cellular signaling molecules. Previous studies have shown that GGylation is essential for cell survival in many types of cancer. However, the molecular mechanism mediating the cell survival effect remains elusive. In this report, we show that the Hippo pathway mediates GGylation-dependent cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells. Blockade of GGylation enhanced phosphorylation of Mst1/2 and Lats1, and inhibited YAP and TAZ activity and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway-dependent transcription. The effect of GGylation blockade on inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and migration is dependent on the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling, in which YAP appears to regulate cell proliferation and TAZ to regulate cell migration. Furthermore, GGylation-dependent cell proliferation is correlated with the activity of YAP/TAZ in breast cancer cells. Finally, G\u03b3 and RhoA are the GGylated proteins that may transduce GGylation signals to the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Taken together, our studies have demonstrated that the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway is essential for GGylation-dependent cancer cell proliferation and migration."

Among them, pregabalin, gabapentin and carbamazepine are well known antiepileptic drugs. Among the group of new antiepileptic drugs, which are addressed to 1% of human world population suffering from seizures, it turned out that 30% of the seizures resistant to pharmacotherapy has not enough market to justify the costs of drug development. Therefore, it is already a phenomenon that researchers turn their projects toward a larger market, related with possible similar mechanism. Anticonvulsant mechanism of action is in the first place among primary indications for drugs revealing potential analgesic activity. Therefore, many drug candidates for epilepsy, still in preclinical stage, are being evaluated for activity in neuropathic pain.

Since the introduction of diphtheria toxoid vaccine in 1920s, and its widespread use by the late 1940s, diphtheria became increasingly rare in the United States. However, through the 1970s diphtheria remained endemic in some states, with reported incidence rates > 1.0 per million population in six states (Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Washington). Starting in 1980, less than five cases have been reported each year in the United States. The majority of culture-confirmed cases have been associated with importation from other countries. Toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the organism causing diphtheria, was thought to have become rare or even have disappeared from previously endemic areas such as South Dakota. However, during four months in 1996, 11 persons (one index case, six patients and four household contacts) in an American Indian community in South Dakota were found to be infected by C. diphtheriae; six of these isolates were toxigenic. The findings in this report indicate that despite 20 years without reported respiratory diphtheria cases, toxigenic C. diphtheriae is still present in South Dakota. The continuous circulation of toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae emphasizes the need for health care providers throughout South Dakota to promote timely vaccination against diphtheria among persons of all ages and ethnic groups, to be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms of diphtheria so that cases can be promptly diagnosed and treated, and further public health measures can be taken to contain this serious disease."

Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Imatinib-induced changes were blocked with the EGFR antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of EGFR in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with imatinib demonstrated activation of EGFR and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and EGFR, but not Her2/ErbB2. An in vitro kinase assay showed that imatinib did not directly affect EGFR kinase activity, suggesting involvement of EGFR-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and to a lesser extent transforming growth factor-alpha, reduced imatinib-mediated mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Imatinib stimulated the rapid release of soluble HB-EGF and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound HB-EGF, which correlated with biphasic MAPK activation. Together, these results suggested that imatinib affects EGFR activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous EGFR-activating ligands. Although, imatinib primarily inhibits tyrosine kinases, it also stimulates the activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients."

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The decision for operative treatment of patients with spinal metastases is dependent on the patient's predicted survival. Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution. PATIENT SAMPLE: The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patients. The potential prognostic factors that are known to influence survival such as general condition, extraspinal bone metastases, vertebral bone metastases, visceral metastases, and neurologic assessment based on Frankel score were also studied. METHODS: The predicted survival according to the four scoring systems were calculated and labeled as \"A\" scores. These patients were then rescored by assigning NPC as a good prognostic tumor and labeled as \"B\" scores. The predicted survival of scores A and B were compared with actual survival. Potential prognostic factors of survival were investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. For all scoring systems, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests were done; the predictive values were calculated using postestimation after Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: The median overall survival for the whole cohort was 13 (range 1-120) months. In multivariate analysis, general condition (p<.01), visceral metastases (p<.01), and vertebral metastases (p<.01) showed significant association with survival. The absolute score of all scoring systems was significantly associated with actual survival, which extended to the different prognostic subgroups of each scoring systems. Log-rank test revealed significant differences in survival between the different prognostic subgroups of all scoring systems (p<.01). Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosis. All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients. The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so."

METHODS: A total of 4818 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were screened for the presence of carbapenemases by ertapenem and imipenem disc diffusion tests. All positive screening isolates were subjected to modified Hodge test, phenylboronic acid- and EDTA-carbapenem combined disc tests and two multiplex PCRs of bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM) and bla(GIM), and of bla(KPC), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA-48). Carbapenemase-producing isolates were typed by PFGE and then characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Conjugation was performed using a broth culture mating method. RESULTS: Two isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii produced NDM-1, whereas two other isolates of K. pneumoniae produced IMP-14a. DNA fingerprints revealed that the metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates were of different strains except for clonal strains of C. freundii. In vitro transfer of carbapenem resistance was successful for the eight MBL-producing isolates. All MBL producers were susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. The six NDM-producing isolates were recovered from the urine of three patients, who had no history of travel outside Thailand. Interestingly, one patient had chronic urinary tract infections caused by a K. pneumoniae strain and two strains of E. coli producing NDM-1.

Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play essential roles in red blood cell development.

The mechanisms by which these interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood. However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This provides a possible mechanism by which dysregulated expression of hematopoietic transcription factors leads to lineage maturation arrest in leukemias."

Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane. The physiological role for junctin in the luminal regulation of RyR Ca(2+) release remains unresolved, but it appears to be essential for proper cardiac function since ablation of junctin results in increased ventricular automaticity. Given that the junctin levels are severely reduced in human failing hearts, we performed an in-depth study of the mechanisms affecting intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in junctin-deficient cardiomyocytes. In concurrence with sparks, JCN-KO cardiomyocytes display increased Ca(2+) transient amplitude, resulting from increased SR [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](SR)). Junctin ablation appears to affect how RyRs 'sense' SR Ca(2+) load, resulting in decreased diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak despite an elevated [Ca(2+)](SR). Surprisingly, the \u03b2-adrenergic enhancement of [Ca(2+)](SR) reverses the decrease in RyR activity and leads to spontaneous Ca(2+) release, evidenced by the development of spontaneous aftercontractions. Single channel recordings of RyRs from WT and JCN-KO cardiac SR indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of RyRs to luminal [Ca(2+)]: at low luminal [Ca(2+)] (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid RyR channels are less responsive to luminal [Ca(2+)]; conversely, high luminal [Ca(2+)] turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation. Thus, junctin produces complex effects on Ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal [Ca(2+)]-dependent dual response of junctin-devoid RyRs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of RyR channels at low luminal [Ca(2+)], and as an inhibitor at high luminal [Ca(2+)]. Because the crossover occurs at a [Ca(2+)](SR) that is close to that present in resting cells, it is possible that the activator-inhibitor role of junctin may be exerted under periods of prevalent parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively."

A preceding screening transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with an aortic diameter of 3.2 cm; at the time of moyamoya diagnosis, the aorta was 3.5 cm with mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. Four years later, the patient had had an acute aortic dissection, Stanford type A, which was repaired successfully. This case report is the third individual with TS associated with moyamoya disease and the first associated with dissection. The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV). Although this may be a chance occurrence, we hypothesize that moyamoya disease could be a manifestation of the vasculopathy in TS."

Regulation of DNA replication initiation is essential for the faithful inheritance of genetic information. Replication initiation is a multi-step process involving many factors including ORC, Cdt1p, Mcm2-7p and other proteins that bind to replication origins to form a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). As a prerequisite for pre-RC assembly, Cdt1p and the Mcm2-7p heterohexameric complex accumulate in the nucleus in G1 phase in an interdependent manner in budding yeast. However, the nature of this interdependence is not clear, nor is it known whether Cdt1p is required for the assembly of the MCM complex. In this study, we provide the first evidence that Cdt1p, through its interaction with Mcm6p with the C-terminal regions of the two proteins, is crucial for the formation of the MCM complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. We demonstrate that disruption of the interaction between Cdt1p and Mcm6p prevents the formation of the MCM complex, excludes Mcm2-7p from the nucleus, and inhibits pre-RC assembly and DNA replication. Our findings suggest a function for Cdt1p in promoting the assembly of the MCM complex and maintaining its integrity by interacting with Mcm6p."

Using a biotinylation tagging/proteomics approach in erythroid cells, we describe distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. Importantly, we show that FOG-1 mediates GATA-1 interactions with the MeCP1 complex, thus providing an explanation for the overlapping functions of these two factors in erythropoiesis. We also show that subsets of GATA-1 gene targets are bound in vivo by distinct complexes, thus linking specific GATA-1 partners to distinct aspects of its functions.

Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is a rare form of diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life. Heterozygous activation mutations in KCNJ11, encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, which acts as a key role in insulin secretion regulation, account for about half of the cases of PNDM. The majority of the patients represent isolated cases resulting from de novo mutations. Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome. Individuals with KCNJ11 mutations have been successfully transitioned from insulin to sulfonylurea (SU) therapy. Furthermore, there have been cases reported with variable improvement in neurological function following a successful switching. We describe a 12-year-old Portuguese girl with PNDM due to the previously reported R201C mutation in the KCNJ11 gene. Her medical history includes prematurity and moderate developmental delay. The mutation was inherited from her mother who has isolated PNDM. The patient was successfully transferred from insulin to SU, whereas her mother showed SU resistance. Despite good glycemic control, no improvements in the cognitive performance were verified. We present our experience in switching treatment from insulin to oral SUs in this family, and also discuss whether or not the girl's developmental delay is related with the Kir6.2 mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first Portuguese patient reported with successful transition to SU treatment."

We hypothesized that renal macrophage infiltration and inflammation would cause increased lymphatic vessel density in hypertensive rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) that exhibit hypertension and renal injury (SHR-A3 strain) had significantly increased renal lymphatic vessel density and macrophages at 40 wk of age compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. SHR rats that exhibit hypertension but minimal renal injury (SHR-B2 strain) had significantly less renal lymphatic vessel density compared with WKY rats. The signals for lymphangiogenesis, VEGF-C and its receptor VEGF-R3, and proinflammatory cytokine genes increased significantly in the kidneys of SHR-A3 rats but not in SHR-B2 rats. Fischer 344 rats exhibit normal blood pressure but develop renal injury as they age. Kidneys from 24-mo- and/or 20-mo-old Fischer rats had significantly increased lymphatic vessel density, macrophage infiltration, VEGF-C and VEGF-R3 expression, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression compared with 4-mo-old controls.

Transcripts harboring premature signals for translation termination are recognized and rapidly degraded by eukaryotic cells through a pathway known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In addition to protecting cells by preventing the translation of potentially deleterious truncated peptides, studies have suggested that NMD plays a broader role in the regulation of the steady-state levels of physiologic transcripts. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three trans-acting factors (Upf1p to Upf3p) are required for NMD. Orthologues of Upf1p have been identified in numerous species, showing that the NMD machinery, at least in part, is conserved through evolution. In this study, we demonstrate additional functional conservation of the NMD pathway through the identification of Upf2p homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and humans (rent2). Disruption of S. pombe UPF2 established that this gene is required for NMD in fission yeast. rent2 was demonstrated to interact directly with rent1, a known trans-effector of NMD in mammalian cells. Additionally, fragments of rent2 were shown to possess nuclear targeting activity, although the native protein localizes to the cytoplasmic compartment. Finally, novel functional domains of Upf2p and rent2 with homology to eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and other translational regulatory proteins were identified. Directed mutations within these so-called eIF4G homology (4GH) domains were sufficient to abolish the function of S. pombe Upf2p. Furthermore, using the two-hybrid system, we obtained evidence for direct interaction between rent2 and human eIF4AI and Sui1, both components of the translation initiation complex. Based on these findings, a novel model in which Upf2p and rent2 effects decreased translation and accelerated decay of nonsense transcripts through competitive interactions with eIF4G-binding partners is proposed."

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate. BACKGROUND: Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI. However, TIMI grade 3 patency rates 90 min into thrombolysis of only 50% to 60% indicate an obvious need for improved thrombolytic regimens. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic simulations were performed to design a new rt-PA regimen. We aimed for a plateau tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) plasma level similar to that of the first plateau of the Neuhaus regimen. These aims were achieved with a 20-mg rt-PA intravenous (i.v.) bolus followed by an 80-mg i.v. infusion over 60 min (regimen A). This regimen was tested in a consecutive comparative trial in 80 patients versus 2.25 10(6) IU of streptokinase/60 min (B), and 70 mg (C) or 100 mg (D) of rt-PA over 90 min. Subsequently, a confirmation trial of regimen A in 254 consecutive patients was performed with angiographic assessment by independent investigators of patency at 90 min. RESULTS: The comparative phase of the trial yielded, respectively, TIMI grade 3 and total patency (TIMI grades 2 and 3) of 80% and 85% (regimen A), 35% and 50% (B), 50% and 55% (C) and 60% and 70% (D). In the confirmation phase of the trial, regimen A yielded 81.1% TIMI grade 3 and 87.0% total patency. At follow-up angiography 7 (4.1%) of 169 vessels had reoccluded. In-hospital mortality rate was 1.2%. Nadir levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-antiplasmin were 3.6 +/- 0.8 mg/ml, 60 +/- 21% and 42 +/- 16%, respectively (mean +/- SD). Fifty-seven patients (22.4%) suffered from bleeding; 3.5% needed blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate. These results are substantially better than those reported from all currently utilized regimens. Head to head comparison with established thrombolytic regimens in a large-scale randomized trial is warranted."

While the majority of ovarian cancers are serous, some rarer subtypes (i.e. clear cell) are often associated with endometriosis, a benign gynecological disease. Iron is rich in the cyst fluid of endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers and induces persistent oxidative stress. The role of iron, an essential nutrient involved in multiple cellular functions, in normal ovarian cell survival and ovarian cancer remains unclear. Iron, presented as ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), dramatically inhibits cell survival in ovarian cancer cell types associated with Ras mutations, while it is without effect in immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial (T80) and endometriotic epithelial cells (lacking Ras mutations). Interestingly, FAC induced changes in cytoplasmic vacuolation concurrently with increases in LC3-II levels (an autophagy marker); these changes occurred in an ATG5/ATG7-dependent, beclin-1/hVps34-independent, and Ras-independent manner. Knockdown of autophagy mediators in HEY ovarian cancer cells reversed FAC-induced LC3-II levels, but there was little effect on reversing the cell death response. Intriguingly, transmission electron microscopy of FAC-treated T80 cells demonstrated abundant lysosomes (confirmed using Lysotracker) rich in iron particles, which occurred in a Ras-independent manner. Although the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, U0126, reversed FAC-induced LC3-II/autophagic punctae and lysosomes in a Ras-independent manner, it was remarkable that U0126 reversed cell death in malignant ovarian cells associated with Ras mutations. Moreover, FAC increased heme oxygenase-1 expression in H-Ras-overexpressing T80 cells, which was associated with increased cell death when overexpressed in T80 cells. Disruption of intracellular iron levels, via chelation of intracellular iron (deferoxamine), was also detrimental to malignant ovarian cell survival; thus, homeostatic intracellular iron levels are essential for cell survival. Collectively, our results implicate iron in modulating cell death in a Ras- and MAPK-dependent manner in ovarian cancer cells."

Active transcription starts when the pause release factor P-TEFb is recruited to initiate productive elongation. However, the mechanism of P-TEFb recruitment and regulation of NELF/DSIF during transcription is not fully understood. We investigated this question in interferon (IFN)-stimulated transcription, focusing on BRD4, a BET family protein that interacts with P-TEFb. Besides P-TEFb, BRD4 binds to acetylated histones through the bromodomain. We found that BRD4 and P-TEFb, although not present prior to IFN treatment, were robustly recruited to IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) after stimulation. Likewise, NELF and DSIF prior to stimulation were hardly detectable on ISGs, which were strongly recruited after IFN treatment. A shRNA-based knockdown assay of NELF revealed that it negatively regulates the passage of Pol II and DSIF across the ISGs during elongation, reducing total ISG transcript output. Analyses with a BRD4 small-molecule inhibitor showed that IFN-induced recruitment of P-TEFb and NELF/DSIF was under the control of BRD4. We suggest a model where BRD4 coordinates both positive and negative regulation of ISG elongation."

In the confirmation phase of the trial, regimen A yielded 81.1% TIMI grade 3 and 87.0% total patency. At follow-up angiography 7 (4.1%) of 169 vessels had reoccluded. In-hospital mortality rate was 1.2%. Nadir levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-antiplasmin were 3.6 +/- 0.8 mg/ml, 60 +/- 21% and 42 +/- 16%, respectively (mean +/- SD). Fifty-seven patients (22.4%) suffered from bleeding; 3.5% needed blood transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81.1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1.2% overall mortality rate. These results are substantially better than those reported from all currently utilized regimens. Head to head comparison with established thrombolytic regimens in a large-scale randomized trial is warranted."

OBJECTIVE: Report results of patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms from phase III KEYNOTE-006 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received pembrolizumab 10\u00a0mg/kg every 2 (Q2W) or every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 2 years, or four cycles of ipilimumab 3\u00a0mg/kg Q3W. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was administered at baseline and throughout the study. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) analyses were pre-specified exploratory endpoints; the primary PRO assessment was the score change from baseline to week 12 in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/HRQoL score between the arms using constrained longitudinal data analysis. RESULTS: The PRO analysis population included 776 patients: pembrolizumab Q2W (n\u00a0=\u00a0270); pembrolizumab Q3W (n\u00a0=\u00a0266); ipilimumab (n\u00a0=\u00a0240). Baseline GHS was similar across arms. QLQ-C30 compliance rates at week 12 were 87% (n\u00a0=\u00a0214), 97% (n\u00a0=\u00a0226),\u00a0and 96% (n\u00a0=\u00a0178), for the pembrolizumab Q2W, pembrolizumab Q3W, and ipilimumab arms, respectively. From baseline to week 12, GHS/HRQoL scores were better maintained with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab (decrease of -1.9 and -2.5 for pembrolizumab versus -10.0 for ipilimumab; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for each pembrolizumab arm versus ipilimumab). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced deterioration in GHS at week 12 (31% for pembrolizumab Q2W; 29% for Q3W and 44% for ipilimumab), with similar trends observed for individual functioning and symptoms scales. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was better maintained with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab in patients with ipilimumab-naive advanced melanoma. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01866319."

Lymphatic dysfunction is associated with the progression of many cardiovascular disorders due to their role in maintaining tissue fluid homeostasis. Promoting new lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) is a promising strategy to reverse these cardiovascular disorders via restoring lymphatic function. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) members VEGF-C and VEGF-D are both potent candidates for stimulating lymphangiogenesis, though maintaining spatial and temporal control of these factors represents a challenge to developing efficient therapeutic lymphangiogenic applications. Injectable alginate hydrogels have been useful for the controlled delivery of many angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, to stimulate new blood vasculature. However, the utility of these tunable hydrogels for delivering lymphangiogenic factors has never been closely examined. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize ionically cross-linked alginate hydrogels to deliver VEGF-C and VEGF-D for potential lymphangiogenic applications. We demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are sensitive to temporal presentation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D but with different responses between the factors. The greatest LEC mitogenic and sprouting response was observed for constant concentrations of VEGF-C and a high initial concentration that gradually decreased over time for VEGF-D. Additionally, alginate hydrogels provided sustained release of radiolabeled VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Finally, VEGF-C and VEGF-D released from these hydrogels promoted a similar number of LEC sprouts as exogenously added growth factors and new vasculature in vivo via a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Overall, these findings demonstrate that alginate hydrogels can provide sustained and bioactive release of VEGF-C and VEGF-D which could have applications for therapeutic lymphangiogenesis."

Myogenic differentiation proceeds through a highly coordinated cascade of gene activation that necessitates epigenomic changes in chromatin structure. Using a screen of small molecule epigenetic probes we identified three compounds which inhibited myogenic differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts; (+)-JQ1, PFI-1, and Bromosporine. These molecules target Bromodomain and Extra Terminal domain (BET) proteins, which are epigenetic readers of acetylated histone lysine tail residues. BETi-mediated anti-myogenic effects were also observed in a model of MYOD1-mediated myogenic conversion of human fibroblasts, and in primary mouse and human myoblasts. All three BET proteins BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 exhibited distinct and dynamic patterns of protein expression over the course of differentiation without concomitant changes in mRNA levels, suggesting that BET proteins are regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Specific BET protein knockdown by RNA interference revealed that BRD4 was required for myogenic differentiation, whereas BRD3 down-regulation resulted in enhanced myogenic differentiation. ChIP experiments revealed a preferential binding of BRD4 to the Myog promoter during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, co-incident with increased levels of H3K27 acetylation. These results have identified an essential role for BET proteins in the regulation of skeletal myogenesis, and assign distinct functions to BRD3 and BRD4."

Canagliflozin was the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved by the US FDA for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and recently dapagliflozin has also been approved. AREAS COVERED: We evaluated a recent Phase III clinical trial with dapagliflozin. EXPERT OPINION: Dapagliflozin was studied as add-on therapy to sitagliptin with or without metformin, and was shown to lower HbA1c levels and body weight. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low with dapagliflozin, but it did increase the incidence of urogenital infections. As no clear benefits have been identified for dapagliflozin over canagliflozin, which was the first gliflozin registered by the FDA, we do not fully understand why it was necessary to register dapagliflozin. Given that there are no completed cardiovascular/clinical outcome studies with dapagliflozin, and therefore no evidence of beneficial effect, it also seems premature to be using it extensively or considering it as an alternative to the clinically proven metformin."

In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression."

In the present study, we analyzed human ovarian carcinoma cell lines for abnormalities in the tumor suppressor gene Rb (retinoblastoma) and in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitor genes (p16INK4 and p15INK4B) using molecular biology techniques. For the Rb gene, in all six cell lines (PA-1, Caov-3 and -4, OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3, and Kuramochi), Rb gene abnormality was not detected using Southern blotting. In the Caov-3 cell line transcripts were not detectable by either Northern blot or polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the Rb gene revealed point mutations (AAC to GAC) resulting in codon 123 (Asn to Asp) changes in the Caov-4 cell line. In the PA-1 cell line both wild-type Rb and mutant-type Rb (codon 798: CGG to TGG) were expressed, and in the OVCAR-3 cell line both wild-type Rb and mutant-type Rb (codon 704: ATG to GTG) were expressed. In four of six human ovarian carcinoma cell lines Rb gene abnormality was detected. For the p16INK4 and p15INK4B genes, only the SK-OV-3 cell line had abnormalities. There was a gene rearrangement or minor deletion of the p16INK4 gene in the SK-OV-3 cell line, while the p15INK4B gene was deleted in this cell line. In the SK-OV-3 cell line no mRNAs of p16INK4 and p15INK4B were expressed. At the point of Rb gene inactivation, we can explain five cell lines of six: four cell lines had abnormalities in the Rb gene itself, which is another mechanism by which the Rb gene is inactivated, while one cell line (SK-OV-3) had abnormalities in CDK4 inhibitor genes, another of the inactivation mechanisms of the Rb gene. These data suggest that abnormalities of Rb and CDK4 inhibitor genes (p16INK4, p15INK4B) may be involved in human ovarian carcinogenesis."

Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasm. This agent inhibited late-stage steps in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in permeabilized E. faecium when either the UDP-muramyl-pentapeptide precursor from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or the UDP-muramyl-pentadepsipeptide precursor from vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was used as a substrate. Inhibition of late-stage steps led to accumulation of an N-acetyl-[14C]glucosamine-labeled lipid intermediate indicative of inhibition of the transglycosylation step. Inhibition of peptidoglycan polymerization without affecting cross-linking in a particulate membrane-plus-wall-fragment assay from Aerococcus viridans was consistent with this explanation. The fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin."

However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes.

Isolation of highly purified plasma membranes is the key step in constructing the plasma membrane proteome. Traditional plasma membrane isolation method takes advantage of the differential density of organelles. While differential centrifugation methods are sufficient to enrich for plasma membranes, the procedure is lengthy and results in low recovery of the membrane fraction. Importantly, there is significant contamination of the plasma membranes with other organelles. The traditional agarose affinity matrix is suitable for isolating proteins but has limitation in separating organelles due to the density of agarose. Immobilization of affinity ligands to magnetic beads allows separation of affinity matrix from organelles through magnets and could be developed for the isolation of organelles. We have developed a simple method for isolating plasma membranes using lectin concanavalin A (ConA) magnetic beads. ConA is immobilized onto magnetic beads by binding biotinylated ConA to streptavidin magnetic beads. The ConA magnetic beads are used to bind glycosylated proteins present in the membranes. The bound membranes are solubilized from the magnetic beads with a detergent containing the competing sugar alpha methyl mannoside. In this study, we describe the procedure of isolating rat liver plasma membranes using sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described by Neville. We then further purify the membrane fraction by using ConA magnetic beads. After this purification step, main liver plasma membrane proteins, especially the highly glycosylated ones and proteins containing transmembrane domains could be identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. While not described here, the magnetic bead method can also be used to isolate plasma membranes from cell lysates. This membrane purification method should expedite the cataloging of plasma membrane proteome."

UNLABELLED: The increasing role of metabolomics in system biology is driving the development of tools for comprehensive analysis of high-resolution NMR spectral datasets. This task is quite challenging since unlike the datasets resulting from other 'omics', a substantial preprocessing of the data is needed to allow successful identification of spectral patterns associated with relevant biological variability. HiRes is a unique stand-alone software tool that combines standard NMR spectral processing functionalities with techniques for multi-spectral dataset analysis, such as principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization. In addition, HiRes contains extensive abilities for data cleansing, such as baseline correction, solvent peak suppression, removal of frequency shifts owing to experimental conditions as well as auxiliary information management. Integration of these components together with multivariate analytical procedures makes HiRes very capable of addressing the challenges for assessment and interpretation of large metabolomic datasets, greatly simplifying this otherwise lengthy and difficult process and assuring optimal information retrieval.

In three forms, caused by mutations in parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), or DJ-1 (PARK7), the phenotype is usually characterized by levodopa-responsive parkinsonism without atypical features. Parkin mutations are most frequent, explaining -50% of the cases with a clinical diagnosis of familial Parkinson's disease compatible with recessive inheritance and onset <45 years, and -15% of the sporadic cases with onset <45. Mutations in PINK1 and DJ-1 are less common, accounting for -1-8%, and -1-2% of the sporadic cases with early-onset. Since point mutations and genomic rearrangements can be present, sequencing and exon dosage are both required for accurate mutational screening of these genes. The phenotype of parkin mutations is characterized by early-onset parkinsonism, good response to levodopa, and benign course. The average onset age is in the 30s, but late-onset cases have been described. The phenotype associated with PINK1 and DJ-1 mutations has been studied in a smaller number of patients but it is overall indistinguishable from that of parkin. Mutations in other genes, including ATP13A2 (PARK9), PLA2G6 (PARK14), and FBX07 (PARK15), cause more rare forms of recessive parkinsonism with very early-onset (<30 years) and usually additional, atypical features (pyramidal, dystonic, ocular movement, and cognitive disturbances). Yet, it is expected that other monogenic forms of parkinsonism will be identified in the future, as mutations in the above-mentioned genes are not found in other patients with similar phenotypes."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate dolutegravir and elvitegravir/cobicistat pharmacokinetics in HIV-negative volunteers up to 10 days after drug cessation. METHODS: Healthy volunteers received 50 mg of dolutegravir once-daily for 10 days, then underwent a 9 day wash-out period, and then received elvitegravir/cobicistat as part of Stribild(\u00ae) (245 mg of tenofovir, 200 mg of emtricitabine, 150 mg of elvitegravir and 150 mg of cobicistat) for 10 days. Serial pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling occurred prior to the final dose of each course and at regular intervals for up to 216 h (10 days) after drug cessation. Concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS, and PK parameters were illustrated as geometric mean and 90% CI. RESULTS: Seventeen volunteers completed the study. For dolutegravir, plasma terminal elimination t1/2 to the last measurable concentration (within 216 h) was longer than its t1/2 within the dosing interval (0-24 h): 14.3 h (12.9-15.7 h) versus 23.1 h (19.7-26.6 h); conversely, the terminal elimination t1/2 for elvitegravir was lower than its t1/2 within the dosing interval (0-24 h): 10.8 h (9.7-13.0 h) versus 5.2 h (4.7-6.1 h). Dolutegravir concentrations were above the protein-adjusted (PA) IC90 (64 ng/mL) in 100% of subjects after 36 and 48 h and in 94% after 60 and 72 h. All subjects had detectable dolutegravir concentrations at 96 h, a mean of 23.5% above the IC90. Elvitegravir concentrations were above the PA IC95 (45 ng/mL) in 100% of subjects at 24 h, 65% at 36 h but 0% after 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show marked differences in the elimination rates of dolutegravir and elvitegravir following treatment interruption, which is likely to impact the extent to which drug doses can be delayed or missed. They suggest that clinical differences may emerge in patients who have suboptimal adherence."

Heterozygous activating mutations in the gene encoding for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) have recently been shown to be a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. Kir6.2 is expressed in muscle, neuron and brain as well as the pancreatic beta-cell, so patients with KCNJ11 mutations could have a neurological phenotype in addition to their diabetes. It is proposed that some patients with KCNJ11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes (DEND), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes. We identified KCNJ11 mutations in four of 10 probands with permanent neonatal diabetes and one affected parent; this included the novel C166F mutation and the previously described V59M and R201H. Four of the five patients with mutations had neurological features: the patient with the C166F mutation had marked developmental delay, severe generalised epilepsy, hypotonia and muscle weakness; mild developmental delay was present in the patient with the V59M mutation; one patient with the R201H mutation had acute and chronic neurological consequences of cerebral oedema and another had diabetic neuropathy from chronic hyperglycaemia. In conclusion, the clinical features in these patients support the existence of a discrete neurological syndrome with KCNJ11 mutations. The severe DEND syndrome was seen with the novel C166F mutation and mild developmental delay with the V59M mutation. These features differ markedly from the neurological consequences of acute or chronic diabetes."

Technical difficulties related to detection of insulin resistance created obstacles to application of the term \"metabolic syndrome\" in clinical practice. In 2001 experts of National Cholesterol Education Program in USA suggested new set of criteria. The presence of 3 or more of the following 5 components (abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension and high fasting blood glucose) allows to diagnose metabolic syndrome. These worldwide used criteria do not imply detection of insulin resistance. Feasibility of this approach has been confirmed by analysis of correlation between presence of markers of insulin resistance and that of metabolic syndrome according to novel criteria. This analysis has shown that combination of 3 or more components is significantly associated with insulin resistance."

S100B is a calcium sensing protein belonging to the S100 protein family with intracellular and extracellular roles. It is one of the EF hand homodimeric proteins, which is known to interact with various protein targets to regulate varied biological functions. Extracellular S100B has been recently reported to interact with FGF2 in a RAGE-independent manner. However, the recognition mechanism of S100B-FGF2 interaction at the molecular level remains unclear. In this study, the critical residues on S100B-FGF2 interface were mapped by combined information derived from NMR spectroscopy and site directed mutagenesis experiments. Utilizing NMR titration data, we generated the structural models of S100B-FGF2 complex from the computational docking program, HADDOCK which were further proved stable during 15ns unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies indicated S100B interaction with FGF2 is an entropically favored process implying dominant role of hydrophobic contacts at the protein-protein interface. Residue level information of S100B interaction with FGF2 was useful to understand the varied target recognition ability of S100B and further explained its role in effecting extracellular signaling diversity. Mechanistic insights into the S100B-FGF2 complex interface and cell-based assay studies involving mutants led us to conclude the novel role of S100B in FGF2 mediated FGFR1 receptor inactivation."

Epigenetic factors such as histone methylation control the developmental progression of malaria parasites during the complex life cycle in the human host. We investigated Plasmodium falciparum histone lysine methyltransferases as a potential target class for the development of novel antimalarials. We synthesized a compound library based upon a known specific inhibitor (BIX-01294) of the human G9a histone methyltransferase. Two compounds, BIX-01294 and its derivative TM2-115, inhibited P. falciparum 3D7 parasites in culture with IC(50) values of ~100 nM, values at least 22-fold more potent than their apparent IC(50) toward two human cell lines and one mouse cell line. These compounds irreversibly arrested parasite growth at all stages of the intraerythrocytic life cycle. Decrease in parasite viability (>40%) was seen after a 3-h incubation with 1 \u00b5M BIX-01294 and resulted in complete parasite killing after a 12-h incubation. Additionally, mice with patent Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain infection treated with a single dose (40 mg/kg) of TM2-115 had 18-fold reduced parasitemia the following day. Importantly, treatment of P. falciparum parasites in culture with BIX-01294 or TM2-115 resulted in significant reductions in histone H3K4me3 levels in a concentration-dependent and exposure time-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that BIX-01294 and TM2-115 inhibit malaria parasite histone methyltransferases, resulting in rapid and irreversible parasite death. Our data position histone lysine methyltransferases as a previously unrecognized target class, and BIX-01294 as a promising lead compound, in a presently unexploited avenue for antimalarial drug discovery targeting multiple life-cycle stages."

TF1, an HU homologue with a 37 bp binding site that is encoded by the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1, binds with nM affinity to DNA that contains 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) in place of thymine and to T-containing DNA with loops. We evaluated the contribution of three conserved lysines to specifying the length of the binding site and show that Lys3 is critical for maintaining a long binding site in T-containing DNA: A mutant protein in which Lys3 is replaced with Gln(TF1-K3Q) is completely deficient in forming a stable complex. The affinity for 37 bp hmU-containing DNA is also reduced, from approximately 3 nM for wild-type TF1 to approximately 90 nM for TF1-K3Q. The decrease in affinity of TF1-K3Q for hmU-containing DNA > or = 25 bp suggests that Lys3 contacts DNA 8-9 bp distal to the sites of kinking. We propose that Lys3 forms an internal saltbridge to Asp26 in HU homologues characterized by shorter binding sites and that its surface exposure, and hence a longer binding site, may correlate with absence of this aspartate."

KDM5B/Jarid1B/PLU1 is an H3K4me3/me2-specific lysine demethylase belonging to the JmjC domain-containing family of histone demethylases (JHDMs). Several studies have linked KDM5B to breast, prostate and skin cancer, highlighting its potential as a drug target.

Here, we report the expression, purification and characterization of the catalytic core of recombinant KDM5B (ccKDM5B, residues 1-769). We show that ccKDM5B, recombinantly expressed in insect cells, demethylates H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in vitro. The kinetic characterization showed that ccKDM5B has an apparent Michaelis constant (K(m) (app) ) value of 0.5 \u03bcm for its trimethylated substrate H3(1-15)K4me3, a considerably increased apparent substrate affinity than reported for related HDMs. Despite the presence of a PHD domain, the catalytic activity was not affected by additional methylation at the H3K9 position, suggesting that in vitro chromatin cross-talk between H3K4 and H3K9 does not occur for ccKDM5B. Inhibition studies of ccKDM5B showed both in vitro and in cell inhibition of ccKDM5B by 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA) with a potency similar to that reported for the HDM KDM4C. Structure-guided sequence alignment indicated that the binding mode of 2,4-PDCA is conserved between KDM4A/C and KDM5B."

Wernicke's encephalopathy is a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and confusion seen in alcoholics with dietary vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. A rare genetic defect of thiamine transporter-2 may lead to similar clinical features, biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD). A 15-year-old girl developed rapid onset ptosis and ophthalmoplegia evolving into a subacute encephalopathy. Neuroimaging demonstrated symmetrical basal ganglia and mid-brain lesions reminiscent of Leigh's subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy. Oral biotin and thiamine were started, and symptoms improved dramatically the next day. The therapeutic response suggested SLC19A3, encoding thiamine transporter-2, as a strong candidate gene and Sanger sequencing revealed a novel homozygous c.517A>G;p.Asn173Asp mutation, which segregated with disease within the family. BTBGD is a potentially treatable neurological disorder and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of Leigh syndrome and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Since delayed treatment results in permanent neurological dysfunction or death, prompt diagnosis and early initiation of biotin and thiamine therapy are essential."

Multiciliated cells are abundant in the epithelial surface of different tissues, including cells lining the walls of the lateral ventricles in the brain and the airway epithelium. Their main role is to control fluid flow and defects in their differentiation are implicated in many human disorders, such as hydrocephalus, accompanied by defects in adult neurogenesis and mucociliary disorder in the airway system. Here we show that Mcidas, which is mutated in human mucociliary clearance disorder, and GemC1 (Gmnc or Lynkeas), previously implicated in cell cycle progression, are key regulators of multiciliated ependymal cell generation in the mouse brain. Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that Mcidas and GemC1 are sufficient and necessary for cell fate commitment and differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated ependymal cells. Furthermore, we show that GemC1 and Mcidas operate in hierarchical order, upstream of Foxj1 and c-Myb transcription factors, which are known regulators of ependymal cell generation, and that Notch signaling inhibits GemC1 and Mcidas function. Our results suggest that Mcidas and GemC1 are key players in the generation of multiciliated ependymal cells of the adult neurogenic niche."

We also discussed a possible role of RNA secondary structure at this site in the regulation of hth pre-mRNA splicing. In this report we identify a shorter evolutionary conserved intronic element within the hth gene that is located downstream of the first element and has sequence complementarity to it. We demonstrate that intramolecular interactions between these two elements would give rise to alternative RNA secondary structures, which in turn may result in differential control of homothorax pre-mRNA splicing.

BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma treated with BCNU wafer implantation for recurrence frequently receive frontline chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as part of the Stupp protocol. A retrospective investigation was conducted of surgical complications in a cohort of these patients treated at a single institution. METHODS: We searched our institutional database for patients treated between January 2006 and October 2012 who had recurrent glioblastoma previously treated with open surgery followed by the Stupp protocol and then underwent repeat resection with or without BCNU wafers for recurrent disease. Rates of select post-operative complications within 3 months of surgery were estimated. RESULTS: We identified 95 patients with glioblastoma who underwent resection followed by the Stupp protocol as frontline treatment. At disease recurrence (first and second recurrence), 63 patients underwent repeat resection with BCNU wafer implantation and 32 without implantation. Generally, BCNU wafer use was associated with minor to moderate increases in rates of select complications versus non-implantation-wound healing abnormalities (14.2 vs. 6.2 %), cerebrospinal fluid leak (7.9 vs. 3.1 %), hydrocephalus requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt (6.3 vs. 9.3 %), chemical meningitis (3.1 vs. 0 %), cerebral infections (3.1 vs. 0 %), cyst formation (3.1 vs. 3.1 %), cerebral edema (4.7 vs. 0 %), and empyema formations (1.5 vs. 0 %). Performance status was well maintained post-operatively in both groups. Median progression-free survival from the time of first recurrence was 6.0 and 5.0 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Stupp protocol as frontline therapy in patients with glioblastoma does not preclude the use of BCNU wafers at the time of progression."

OBJECTIVES: A simple clinical score (ABCD(2) score) has been introduced to triage TIA patients with a high early risk of stroke. External validation studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding the predictive ability of the ABCD(2) score. We aimed to prospectively validate the former score in a multicenter case series study. METHODS: We prospectively calculated the ABCD(2) score (age [> or = 60 years: 1 point]; blood pressure [systolic >140 mm Hg or diastolic >90 mm Hg: 1[; clinical features [unilateral weakness: 2, speech disturbance without weakness: 1, other symptom: 0]; duration of symptoms [ <10 minutes: 0, 10-59 minutes: 1, > or = 60 minutes: 2]; diabetes mellitus [yes: 1]) in consecutive TIA patients hospitalized in 3 tertiary care neurology departments across 2 different racial populations (white and Asian). RESULTS: The 7-day and 90-day risks of stroke in the present case series (n = 148) were 8% (95% CI 4%-12%) and 16% (95% CI 10%-22%). The ABCD(2) score accurately discriminated between TIA patients with high 7-day (c statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.88) and 90-day (c statistic 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.86) risks of stroke. The 90-day risk of stroke was 7-fold higher in patients with an ABCD(2) score >3 points (28%, 95% CI 18%-38%) than in patients with an ABCD(2) score < or = 3 points (4%, 95% CI 0%-9%). After adjustment for stroke risk factors, race, history of previous TIA, medication use before the index TIA and secondary prevention treatment strategies, an ABCD(2) score of >2 was associated with a nearly 5-fold greater 90-day risk of stroke (hazard ratio 4.65, 95% CI 1.04-20.84, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Our findings externally validate the usefulness of the ABCD(2) score in triaging TIA patients with a high risk of early stroke in a multiethnic sample of hospitalized patients. The present data support current guidelines endorsing the immediate hospitalization of patients with an ABCD(2) score >2."

BS is caused by mutations in up to 10 different genes, SCN5A being the most frequently involved. Large genomic rearrangements in SCN5A have been associated with conduction disease, but its prevalence in BS is unknown. Seventy-six non-related patients with BS were studied. Clinical characteristics and family risk profile were recorded. Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively. Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X). Patients with mutations had a trend toward a higher proportion of spontaneous type I Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) (87.5% vs 52.9%, p = 0.06) and had evidence of familial disease (62.5%, vs 23.5%, p = 0.03). The symptoms and risk profile of the carriers were not different from wild-type probands. There were non-significant differences in the prevalence of type I ECG, syncope and history of arrhythmia in carriers of selected polymorphisms. None of the patients had any deletion/duplication in the SCN5A gene. In conclusion, 10.5% of our patients had mutations in the SCN5A gene. Patients with mutations seemed to have more spontaneous type I ECG, but no differences in syncope or arrhythmic events compared with patients without mutations. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the SCN5A in the expression of the phenotype and prognosis. Large rearrangements were not identified in the SCN5A gene using the MLPA technique."

To localize the chAB4 sequences more precisely on the acrocentrics, chAB4-specific probes together with rDNA and a number of satellite sequences were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of normal probands and of carriers of Robertsonian translocations of the frequent types rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q). The results demonstrate that chAB4 is located on both sides of the rDNA on all the acrocentrics; the exact location, however, may be chromosome specific.

Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized. Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2). DC is therefore principally a disease of defective telomere maintenance and patients usually have very short telomeres. The genetic advances have led to the unification of DC with several other disorders, including the severe multisystem disorders Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classic DC to aplastic anemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance-\"the telomereopathies.\" These advances have increased our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and highlighted the important role of telomerase and telomeres in human biology.

HIV-1 Vif overcomes these host restriction factors by binding to them and inducing their degradation. Thus, the Vif-A3G and Vif-A3F interactions are attractive targets for antiviral drug development, as inhibiting these interactions could allow the host defense mechanism to control HIV-1 replication. Recently, it has been reported that amino acids 105 to 156 of A3G are involved in the interaction with Vif; however, to date, the region of A3F involved in Vif binding has not been identified. Using our previously reported Vif mutants that are capable of binding to only A3G (3G binder) or only A3F (3F binder), in conjunction with a series of A3G-A3F chimeras, we have now mapped the APOBEC3-Vif interaction domains. We found that the A3G domain that interacts with the Vif YRHHY region is located between amino acids 126 and 132 of A3G, which is consistent with the conclusions reported in previous studies. The A3F domain that interacts with the Vif DRMR region did not occur in the homologous domain but instead was located between amino acids 283 and 300 of A3F. These studies are the first to identify the A3F domain that interacts with the Vif DRMR region and show that distinct domains of A3G and A3F interact with different Vif regions. Pharmacological inhibition of either or both of these Vif-A3 interactions should prevent the degradation of the APOBEC3 proteins and could be used as a therapy against HIV-1."

MOTIVATION: The vast majority of introns in protein-coding genes of higher eukaryotes have a GT dinucleotide at their 5'-terminus and an AG dinucleotide at their 3' end. About 1-2% of introns are non-canonical, with the most abundant subtype of non-canonical introns being characterized by GC and AG dinucleotides at their 5'- and 3'-termini, respectively. Most current gene prediction software, whether based on ab initio or spliced alignment approaches, does not include explicit models for non-canonical introns or may exclude their prediction altogether. With present amounts of genome and transcript data, it is now possible to apply statistical methodology to non-canonical splice site prediction. We pursued one such approach and describe the training and implementation of GC-donor splice site models for Arabidopsis and rice, with the goal of exploring whether specific modeling of non-canonical introns can enhance gene structure prediction accuracy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the incorporation of non-canonical splice site models yields dramatic improvements in annotating genes containing GC-AG and AT-AC non-canonical introns. Comparison of models shows differences between monocot and dicot species, but also suggests GC intron-specific biases independent of taxonomic clade. We also present evidence that GC-AG introns occur preferentially in genes with atypically high exon counts.

However, although initial treatment with these agents is often successful, many women eventually relapse with drug-resistant breast cancers. To overcome some of the challenges associated with current endocrine therapies and to combat the development of resistance, there is a need for more durable and more effective ER-targeted therapies.

RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, RAD1901 produced a robust and profound inhibition of tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft models. In an intracranial MCF-7 model, RAD1901-treated animals survived longer than those treated with either control or fulvestrant, suggesting the potential benefit of RAD1901 in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. Finally, RAD1901 preserved ovariectomy-induced bone loss and prevented the uterotropic effects of E2, suggesting that it may act selectively as an agonist in bone but as an antagonist in breast and uterine tissues. RAD1901 is currently under clinical study in postmenopausal women with ER-positive advanced breast cancer."

We then reranked the ZDOCK predictions using the ZRANK or IRAD scoring functions, pruned and analyzed energy landscapes using clustering, and analyzed the docking results using our interface prediction approach RCF. When possible, we used biological information from the literature to apply constraints to the search space during or after the ZDOCK runs. For approximately half of the standard docking challenges we made at least one prediction that was acceptable or better. For the scoring challenges we made acceptable or better predictions for all but one target. This indicates that our scoring functions are generally able to select the correct binding mode."

Moyamoya is a cerebrovascular angiopathy characterized by a progressive stenosis of the terminal part of the intracranial carotid arteries and the compensatory development of abnormal and fragile collateral vessels, also called moyamoya vessels, leading to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Moyamoya angiopathy can either be the sole manifestation of the disease (moyamoya disease) or be associated with various conditions, including neurofibromatosis, Down syndrome, TAAD (autosomal-dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm), and radiotherapy of head tumors (moyamoya syndromes). Its prevalence is ten times higher in Japan than in Europe, and an estimated 6%-12% of moyamoya disease is familial in Japan. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this condition remain obscure. Here, we report on three unrelated families affected with an X-linked moyamoya syndrome characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, and a stereotyped facial dysmorphism. Other symptoms include an hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, premature coronary heart disease, premature hair graying, and early bilateral acquired cataract. We show that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/MTCP1NB and BRCC3. We also show that brcc3 morphant zebrafish display angiogenesis defects that are rescued by endothelium-specific expression of brcc3. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that BRCC3, a deubiquitinating enzyme that is part of the cellular BRCA1 and BRISC complexes, is an important player in angiogenesis and that BRCC3 loss-of-function mutations are associated with moyamoya angiopathy."

OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnosis and treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex complicated with renal angiomyolipoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 22 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex complicated with renal angiomyolipoma were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 12 males and 10 females with a mean age of 23 (1-46) years. All of them had bilateral multiple renal angiomyolipomas. The mean tumor size was 8.5 (0.7-18.0) cm in diameter. The presence or absence of clinical symptoms showed a significant correlation with tumor size.Eight patients with angiomyolipoma under 4 cm in diameter were continuously monitored at an outpatient clinic. There were 8 patients with lesions of 4-10 cm.Five of them underwent nephron-sparing surgeries and another 3 monitored at an outpatient clinic. There were 6 patients with tumor over 10 cm. Three of them underwent transcatheter arterial embolization and one case took rapamycin after embolization.One patient with concurrent renal cell carcinoma underwent partial nephrectomy. Chronic renal failure occurred in one case dying of pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis with serious hemoptysis. During a mean follow-up of 25 months, neither severe renal hemorrhage nor symptomatic aggravation was found.In the case of rapamycin, there was 10% reduction in the size of angiomyolipoma. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of tuberous sclerosis complex are complicated with bilateral multiple renal angiomyolipoma. The small lesions under 4 cm in diameter may be monitored at an outpatient clinic.For those larger (>4 cm) or symptomatic ones, medication, embolization or surgery is necessary."

The Seipin/BSCL2 gene was originally identified as a candidate gene for congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2 (CGL2) (OMIM #269700). Individuals with homozygous null mutations in seipin have severe lipoatrophy, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and mental retardation without any abnormality of the motor neurons. Recent phenotype analyses of the N88S and S90L mutations have revealed a wide spectrum of Seipin/BSCL2-related motor neuron diseases, including Silver syndrome, distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V, variants of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2, and spastic paraplegia 17; therefore, these diseases should be termed \"seipinopathies\". Seipin is a transmembrane protein that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, the N88S and S90L mutations both disturb the N-glycosylation motif, suggesting that improper glycosylation of seipin is closely associated with the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases. Our recent study demonstrated that seipin is proteolytically cleaved into N and C-terminal fragments and then polyubiquitinated. The N88S and S90L mutations enhance ubiquitination and degradation by UPS, and N88S and S90L mutants appear to be improperly folded, resulting in their accumulation in the ER. Furthermore, expression of mutant seipin in cultured cells activates UPR stress and induces ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our findings suggest that seipin-related motor neuron diseases, seipinopathies are novel conformational diseases, and we propose that the pathological process of these diseases is tightly associated with ER stress-mediated cell death."

Brain imaging and neuropathological studies have shown the ability of both active and passive anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapies of clearing A\u03b2 deposits from the brain of the AD patients. An active anti-A\u03b2 vaccine preparation, AN1792, has been used in AD patients with some clues of clinical efficacy but causing meningoencephalitis in about 6% of patients and it has been abandoned. Several second-generation active A\u03b2 vaccines and passive A\u03b2 immunotherapies have been developed and are under clinical investigation with the aim of accelerating A\u03b2 clearance from the brain of the AD patients. The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce A\u03b2 burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). The results of four ongoing large Phase III trials on bapineuzumab will tell us if passive anti-A\u03b2 immunization is able to alter the course if this devastating disease."

Approximately 80% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1) positive, and although women typically initially respond well to antihormonal therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, resistance often emerges. Although a variety of resistance mechanism may be at play in this state, there is evidence that in many cases the ER still plays a central role, including mutations in the ER leading to constitutively active receptor. Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-\u03b1 and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents. However, fulvestrant suffers from poor pharmaceutical properties and must be administered by intramuscular injections that limit the total amount of drug that can be administered and hence lead to the potential for incomplete receptor blockade. We describe the identification and characterization of a series of small-molecule, orally bioavailable SERDs which are potent antagonists and degraders of ER-\u03b1 and in which the ER-\u03b1 degrading properties were prospectively optimized. The lead compound 11l (GDC-0810 or ARN-810) demonstrates robust activity in models of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, and is currently in clinical trials in women with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer."

Human kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (hK3), also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a 33 kDa single chain glycoprotein belonging to the kallikrein family of serine proteases. With chymotrypsin-like enzymatic activity, hK3 is directly and indirectly involved in a number of diverse biological functions including male fertility, the regulation of cell proliferation, and the inhibition of angiogenesis. The gene encoding hK3, hKLK3, is located on chromosome 19 and its expression has been shown to be regulated by steroid hormones through androgen receptor-mediated transcription. hK3 was once thought to be exclusively expressed and secreted by prostatic epithelial cells, hence the initial name of prostate-specific antigen, but has since been isolated in several nonprostatic tissues and ongoing characterization of alternative splicing variants has found at least 13 distinct mRNA transcripts. The detection of hK3 in cerebrospinal fluid prompted the hypothesis that hK3 may be produced in the brain. To test this notion, in this study we used RT-PCR amplification of brain tissue total RNA and examined hK3 protein by immunohistochemical, and immunoblot analysis. RT-PCR revealed several hK3 mRNA transcripts in the brain. Confirming these findings, both immunohistochemical staining and western immunoblotting showed evidence for hK3 protein in neuronal cells. Taken together, our findings support the expression of hK3 in neuronal cells reinforcing the concept of hK3 as a ubiquitous protein with more multifarious biological activity than previously believed. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the functional significance of hK3 in brain cells."

We did not find a statistically significant sex x mutation interaction for any measure of myofilament performance. Therefore, sarcomeric incorporation of the R403Q myosin similarly enhanced left ventricular myofilament mechanical performance in both male and female mice.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is becoming more and more obvious that epigenetic processes influence the development of rheumatic diseases as strongly as the genetic background. Research on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in rheumatic diseases, and especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been very active for the past 5 years. Most studies have reported the aberrant expression of miRNAs in the circulation or joint tissues, and the pathogenic role of a few of them has been investigated in the experimental models. RECENT FINDINGS: As inflammation and joint damage are the main hallmarks of RA, we focused on the three miRNAs, miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-223, whose functions have been studied in both the processes and the pathogenic role investigated in the experimental models. SUMMARY: Focusing on the role of miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-223 in RA pathogenesis emphasizes the intertwined relationships between bone homeostasis and immunity, and the prominent role of monocytes in RA. Studying the miRNAs in RA will shed light on the pathological processes and help in identifying novel drug candidates and biomarkers."

MCM2-7 is a key component of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC), which is loaded onto chromatin by the concerted action of origin recognition complex, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Here, we demonstrate that And-1 is assembled onto chromatin in late mitosis and early G(1) phase before the assembly of pre-RC in human cells. And-1 forms complexes with MCM2-7 to facilitate the assembly of MCM2-7 onto chromatin at replication origins in late mitosis and G(1) phase. We also present data to show that depletion of And-1 significantly reduces the interaction between Cdt1 and MCM7 in G(1) phase cells. Thus, human And-1 facilitates loading of the MCM2-7 helicase onto chromatin during the assembly of pre-RC."

Studies have shown metronidazole to be useful in the treatment of colonic Crohn's disease, especially for perineal complications. It appears to equal sulfasalazine in effectiveness and to offer hope to patients who fail to respond to that drug. However, exacerbation of perineal disease is to be expected on discontinuation of therapy. The only troublesome side effect is paresthesia, which apparently is dose-related and not progressive. Although no studies exist showing the drug to be mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic in humans, animal and laboratory tests raise concern of this possibility. For this reason, metronidazole therapy should be stopped in two to six months if ineffective and stopped periodically when disease is controlled to see if it can be discontinued."

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of vedolizumab, an \u03b14\u03b27 integrin antibody, in Crohn's disease is unknown. METHODS: In an integrated study with separate induction and maintenance trials, we assessed intravenous vedolizumab therapy (300 mg) in adults with active Crohn's disease. In the induction trial, 368 patients were randomly assigned to receive vedolizumab or placebo at weeks 0 and 2 (cohort 1), and 747 patients received open-label vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2 (cohort 2); disease status was assessed at week 6. In the maintenance trial, 461 patients who had had a response to vedolizumab were randomly assigned to receive placebo or vedolizumab every 8 or 4 weeks until week 52. RESULTS: At week 6, a total of 14.5% of the patients in cohort 1 who received vedolizumab and 6.8% who received placebo were in clinical remission (i.e., had a score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] of < 150, with scores ranging from 0 to approximately 600 and higher scores indicating greater disease activity) (P=0.02); a total of 31.4% and 25.7% of the patients, respectively, had a CDAI-100 response ( > 100-point decrease in the CDAI score) (P=0.23). Among patients in cohorts 1 and 2 who had a response to induction therapy, 39.0% and 36.4% of those assigned to vedolizumab every 8 weeks and every 4 weeks, respectively, were in clinical remission at week 52, as compared with 21.6% assigned to placebo (P<0.001 and P=0.004 for the two vedolizumab groups, respectively, vs. placebo). Antibodies against vedolizumab developed in 4.0% of the patients. Nasopharyngitis occurred more frequently, and headache and abdominal pain less frequently, in patients receiving vedolizumab than in patients receiving placebo. Vedolizumab, as compared with placebo, was associated with a higher rate of serious adverse events (24.4% vs. 15.3%), infections (44.1% vs. 40.2%), and serious infections (5.5% vs. 3.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52. Adverse events were more common with vedolizumab. (Funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals; GEMINI 2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00783692.)."

OBJECTIVE: To identify the interaction partners of a new splicing product of LMO2 gene (LMO2-C), and study its function in K562 cells. METHODS: Maltose binding protein (MBP) pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assay (MTHA) were used to identify the interaction partners of LMO2-C in K562 cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of hematopoietic specific gene glycoprotein (GPA) in K562 cells. RESULTS: MBP-LMO2-C fusion protein was expressed and purified in soluble form successfully. Endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 proteins were confirmed to bind to LMO2-C by MBP pull down analysis. The MTHA also showed that LMO2-C had comparable binding affinities to LDB1 with LMO2-L, and over expression of LMO2-C prevented LMO2-L from binding to LDB1, the inhibition rate being (81.13 +/- 0.68)%. RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of GPA was reduced [(51.00 +/- 1.58)%] in K562 cells while LMO2-C overexpressed. CONCLUSION: LMO2-C can bind endogenous GATA1 and LDB1 protein in K562 cells and down regulates the expression of GPA."

PURPOSE: The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that share the inability of the bone marrow to produce an adequate number of blood cells. The 4 most frequent syndromes are Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). All 4 syndromes have been associated with various physical abnormalities. As part of a genotype/phenotype/cancer susceptibility study, we determined the prevalence of ophthalmic manifestations in these 4 syndromes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a patient cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five patients with an IBMFS and 121 of their first-degree relatives were seen in the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, from 2001 to 2007. The patient group included 22 with FA, 28 with DC, 19 with DBA, and 6 with SDS. METHODS: Every participant underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation and digital facial photography with an adhesive paper ruler on the patient's forehead for an internal measure of scale. Interpupillary distance (IPD), inner canthal distance (ICD), outer canthal distance (OCD), palpebral fissure length (PFL), and corneal diameter (CD) were measured. Thirteen of the 22 patients with FA underwent axial length (AL) measurements by A-scan ultrasonography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and prevalence of ophthalmic manifestations. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of patients with FA had at least 1 abnormal parameter, and 25% of patients had at least 4 abnormal parameters. Eighty-two percent of patients had small palpebral fissures, 69% of patients had simple microphthalmia, 64% of patients had small OCD, 55% of patients had microcornea, 28% of patients had ptosis, and 6% of patients had epicanthal folds. In patients with DC, abnormalities of the lacrimal drainage system (29%) were the most prevalent findings, followed by retinal abnormalities (pigmentary changes, retinal neovascularization, retinal detachment, exudative retinopathy) in 21%, cicatricial entropion with trichiasis and blepharitis in 7% each, and sparse eyelashes and congenital cataract in 3.5% each. No significant ophthalmic abnormalities were seen in patients with DBA or SDS. CONCLUSIONS: Syndrome-specific ocular findings are associated with FA and DC and may antedate diagnosis of the specific syndrome. Early recognition of these abnormalities is important for optimal management."

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions of oxidative stress. RESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response."

In A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, TGF-\u03b2 elicited EMT in Smad-dependent manner and TNF-\u03b1 accelerated this process, as confirmed by cell morphology, expression of EMT markers, capacity of gelatin lysis and cell invasion. TNF-\u03b1 stimulated the phosphorylation of Smad2 linker region, and this effect was attenuated by inhibiting MEK or JNK pathway. Comprehensive expression analysis unraveled genes differentially regulated by TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and ECM (extracellular matrices), suggesting the drastic change in autocrine/paracrine signals as well as cell-to-ECM interactions. Integrated analysis of microRNA signature enabled us to identify a subset of genes, potentially regulated by microRNAs. Among them, we confirmed TGF-\u03b2-mediated induction of miR-23a in lung epithelial cell lines, target genes of which were further identified by gene expression profiling. Combined with in silico approaches, we determined HMGN2 as a downstream target of miR-23a. These findings provide a line of evidence that the effects of TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were partially mediated by microRNAs, and shed light on the complexity of molecular events elicited by TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1."

Delivery of the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc via integrating viral vectors has been widely employed to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from both normal and disease-specific somatic tissues, providing an invaluable resource for medical research and drug development. Residual reprogramming transgene expression from integrated viruses nevertheless alters the biological properties of iPSCs and has been associated with a reduced developmental competence both in vivo and in vitro. We performed transcriptional profiling of mouse iPSC lines before and after excision of a polycistronic lentiviral reprogramming vector to systematically define the overall impact of persistent transgene expression on the molecular features of iPSCs. We demonstrate that residual expression of the Yamanaka factors prevents iPSCs from acquiring the transcriptional program exhibited by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that the expression profiles of iPSCs generated with and without c-Myc are indistinguishable. After vector excision, we find 36% of iPSC clones show normal methylation of the Gtl2 region, an imprinted locus that marks ESC-equivalent iPSC lines. Furthermore, we show that the reprogramming factor Klf4 binds to the promoter region of Gtl2. Regardless of Gtl2 methylation status, we find similar endodermal and hepatocyte differentiation potential comparing syngeneic Gtl2(ON) vs Gtl2(OFF) iPSC clones. Our findings provide new insights into the reprogramming process and emphasize the importance of generating iPSCs free of any residual transgene expression."

Objective: Impulsivity is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) that likely arises from combined genetic and environmental influences. The interaction of the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA-L) gene and early childhood adversity has been shown to predict aggression in clinical and non-clinical populations. Although impulsivity is a risk factor for aggression in BPD and ASPD, little research has investigated potential gene-environment (G\u00d7E) influences impacting its expression in these conditions. Moreover, G\u00d7E interactions may differ by diagnosis. Methods: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals: 20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. Results: A group\u00d7genotype\u00d7abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018), such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11 motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11 attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD. Results additionally indicate that impulsiveness may be expressed differently in BPD and ASPD."

Here we examined the role of km23-1 in TGF\u03b21 autoinduction in TGF\u03b2-sensitive epithelial cells. siRNA blockade of km23-1 reduced TGF\u03b21 mRNA expression, as well as DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the relevant activator protein-1 site in the human TGF\u03b21 promoter. Further, knockdown of km23-1 inhibited TGF\u03b2-mediated activation of ERK and JNK, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and transactivation of the c-Jun promoter. Sucrose gradient analyses indicate that km23-1 was present in lipid rafts together with Ras and T\u03b2RII after TGF\u03b2 treatment. Immunoprecipitation/blot analyses revealed the formation of a TGF\u03b2-inducible complex between Ras and km23-1 in vivo within minutes of TGF\u03b2 addition. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that km23-1 is required for Ras activation by TGF\u03b2. Our results indicate that km23-1 is required for TGF\u03b21 autoinduction through Smad2-independent Ras/ERK/JNK pathways.

In mammals, several orthologs have been identified and are classed into two subfamilies: the LC3 subfamily and the GABARAP subfamily, referred to simply as the LC3 or GABARAP families. GABARAPL1 (GABARAP-like protein 1), one of the proteins belonging to the GABARAP (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein) family, is highly expressed in the central nervous system and implicated in processes such as receptor and vesicle transport as well as autophagy. The proteins that make up the GABARAP family demonstrate conservation of their amino acid sequences and protein structures. In humans, GABARAPL1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP and 61% with GABARAPL2 (GATE-16). The identification of the individual proteins is thus very limited when working in vivo due to a lack of unique peptide sequences from which specific antibodies can be developed. Actually, and to our knowledge, there are no available antibodies on the market that are entirely specific to GABARAPL1 and the same may be true of the anti-GABARAP antibodies. In this study, we sought to examine the specificity of three antibodies targeted against different peptide sequences within GABARAPL1: CHEM-CENT (an antibody raised against a short peptide sequence within the center of the protein), PTG-NTER (an antibody raised against the N-terminus of the protein) and PTG-FL (an antibody raised against the full-length protein). The results described in this article demonstrate the importance of testing antibody specificity under the conditions for which it will be used experimentally, a caution that should be taken when studying the expression of the GABARAP family proteins."

Here, we report the molecular detection of the oral spirochete Treponema denticola in ancient human tissue biopsies of the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old Copper Age natural ice mummy. Initially, the metagenomic data of the Iceman's genomic survey was screened for bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) specific reads. Through ranking the reads by abundance a relatively high number of rRNA reads most similar to T. denticola was detected. Mapping of the metagenome sequences against the T. denticola genome revealed additional reads most similar to this opportunistic pathogen. The DNA damage pattern of specifically mapped reads suggests an ancient origin of these sequences. The haematogenous spread of bacteria of the oral microbiome often reported in the recent literature could already explain the presence of metagenomic reads specific for T. denticola in the Iceman's bone biopsy. We extended, however, our survey to an Iceman gingival tissue sample and a mouth swab sample and could thereby detect T. denticola and Porphyrimonas gingivalis, another important member of the human commensal oral microflora. Taken together, this study clearly underlines the opportunity to detect disease-associated microorganisms when applying metagenomics-enabled approaches on datasets of ancient human remains."

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to PCDH10 down-regulation in medulloblastoma. We examined the role of PCDH10 as a mediator of medulloblastoma cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. METHODS: We identified a focal homozygous deletion of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma by surveying a cohort of 212 tumours by Affymetrix SNP array analysis. PCDH10 expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in a series of 26 tumours. The promoter methylation status of PCDH10 was determined using methylation specific PCR and Sequenom MassCLEAVE analysis. Functional studies examining the role of PCDH10 in medulloblastoma development were performed by re-expression of PCDH10 in the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line, and then, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell migration assays were performed. RESULTS: We report a very focal homozygous deletion on chromosome 4q28.3 harbouring the PCDH10 gene. We demonstrate that PCDH10 transcription is down-regulated in 19/26 (73%) of medulloblastomas suggesting that other mechanisms also could be involved in gene repression. We found that DNA hypermethylation contributed to the deregulation of PCDH10 in 11/44 (25%) of medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumours. Using a stable cell line (DAOY) re-expressing PCDH10, we observed that cell migration was impaired upon restoration of PCDH10 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic deregulation of PCDH10 occurs in a significant portion of medulloblastoma patients. Failure to express PCDH10 may result in loss of inhibition of cell migration, thereby contributing to medulloblastoma progression."

PURPOSE: Meningiomas are frequent intracranial or spinal neoplasms, which recur frequently and can show aggressive clinical behaviour. We elucidated the impact of the integrin inhibitor cilengitide on migration, proliferation, and radiosensitization of meningioma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed integrin expression in tissue microarrays of human meningiomas and the antimeningioma properties of cilengitide in cell cultures, subcutaneous and intracranial nude mouse models by measuring tumor volumes and survival times. RESULTS: \u03b1v\u03b25 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas \u03b1v\u03b23 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels. Application of up to 100 \u03bcg/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines. Effects on cell survival could be enhanced by irradiation. One \u03bcg/mL cilengitide was sufficient to significantly inhibit meningioma cell migration and invasion in vitro. A daily dosage of 75 mg/kg did neither affect tumor volumes nor overall survival (P = 0.813, log-rank test), but suppressed brain invasion in a significant fraction of treated animals. A combination of 75 mg/kg cilengitide daily and irradiation (2 \u00d7 5 Gy) led to a 67% reduction of MRI-estimated tumor volumes in the intracranial model (P < 0.01), whereas the corresponding reduction reached by irradiation alone was only 55% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that a monotherapy with cilengitide is not likely to achieve major responses in rapidly growing malignant meningiomas, although brain invasion may be reduced because of the strong antimigratory properties of the drug. The combination with radiotherapy warrants further attention."

Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance. No difference in survival was observed between epirubicin- and FEC 50-group patients, even though the response rate was significantly worse in the monochemotherapy group."

Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the cardiovascular and renal systems are interdependent. Primary disorders of either system have been shown to disturb the other system. As a result, a class of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) has been identified where in a vicious cycle is established in which acute/chronic dysfunction of either the kidney or the heart exacerbates the loss of function in the other organ. The ADQI organization has proposed a classification derived from a consensus conference held in 2008. CRS is classified as a disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other. The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. A major problem with previous terminology was that it did not allow for identification of pathophysiological interactions occurring in the different types of combined heart/kidney disorders. The subdivision into different subtypes seems to provide a better approach to this syndrome."

BACKGROUND: The choice of parameter sets used to calculate Down's syndrome risks is important. This study details analysis of samples from affected and unaffected pregnancies and evaluates whether published population data is optimal. Screening efficiency realized with measurement procedure-specific population parameters is compared with selected population sets available in the literature. METHODS: In a retrospective experiment, double and triple testing was performed on maternal serum samples from 286 randomly chosen unaffected singleton pregnancies and 95 Down's syndrome affected pregnancy samples. Using a risk cut-off of 1 in 250, detection rates and false positive rates were estimated for different population settings to select a model giving the best overall efficacy. Receiver operation characteristics curve analysis was performed and detection rates realized with the different population settings was estimated at a 5% fixed false positive rate. RESULTS: Geometric mean weight corrected multiples of the median values were 1.01 for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 1.02 for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and 1.01 for unconjugated estriol (uE3) in unaffected pregnancies and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71-0.83) for AFP, 2.42 (95% CI: 2.17-2.71) for hCG and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.83) for uE3 in affected pregnancies. Differences in double and triple risks obtained with the different models were significantly different from each other (p < 0.001). At a cut-off of 1 in 250, the maximum triple test detection rate was 75.8% for a false positive rate of 4.9% and was obtained with the measurement procedure-specific setting. At a fixed false positive rate of 5%, the maximum detection rate for the triple test was 77.9% (95% CI: 62.2%-85.8%). The maximum double test detection rate at 5% false positive rate was 69.6% (95% CI: 59.5%-78.5%). Except for two models, the area under the curve for the triple test was higher than that of the double test. CONCLUSIONS: The Access triple test meets the typical performance characteristics for this test combination. The assay-specific settings yielded the overall best efficacy for the criteria studied. Therefore, the availability of measurement procedure-specific mid-trimester reference values for unaffected and affected pregnancies in prenatal screening programs is essential. Such reference values are established for the Beckman Coulter Access triple test: maternal serum AFP, uE3 and hCG."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score). However, some patients have strokes despite a low predicted risk according to these scores. We designed the ABCDE+ score by adding the variables 'etiology' and ischaemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) -'DWI-positivity'- to the ABCD-score. We hypothesized that this refinement increases the predictability of recurrent ischaemic events. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study amongst all consecutive TIA patients in a university hospital emergency department. Area under the computed receiver-operating curves (AUCs) were used to compare the predictive values of the scores with regard to the outcome stroke or recurrent TIA within 90 days. RESULTS: Amongst 248 patients, 33 (13.3%, 95%-CI 9.3-18.2%) had a stroke (n = 13) or a recurrent TIA (n = 20). Patients with recurrent ischaemic events more often had large-artery atherosclerosis as the cause for TIA (46% vs. 14%, P < 0.001) and positive DWI (61% vs. 35%; P = 0.01) compared with patients without recurrent events. Patients with and those without events did not differ with regard to age, clinical symptoms, duration, blood pressure, risk factors, and stroke preventive treatment. The comparison of AUCs [95%CI] showed superiority of the ABCDE+ score (0.67[0.55-0.75]) compared to the ABCD(2) -score (0.48[0.37-0.58]; P = 0.04) and a trend toward superiority compared to the ABCD-score (0.50[0.40-0.61]; P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In TIA patients, the addition of the variables 'etiology' and 'DWI-positivity' to the ABCD-score seems to enhance the predictability of subsequent cerebral ischaemic events."

Bacterial cell division involves a complex and dynamic sequence of events whereby polymers of the protein FtsZ assemble at the division plane and rearrange to achieve the goal of contracting the cell membrane at the site of cell division, thus dividing the parent cell into two daughter cells. We present a mathematical model (which we refer to as CAM-FF: Critical Accumulation of Membrane-bound FtsZ Fibres) of the assembly of the contractile ring in terms of the accumulation of short linear polymers of FtsZ that associate and dissociate from the cell membrane. In prokaryotes, the biochemical function of FtsZ is thought to underpin the assembly and at least the initial kinetic force of ring contraction. Our model extends earlier work of Surovtsev et al. [PLoS Comput. Biol., 2008, 4, e1000102] by adding (i) the kinetics of FtsZ accumulation on cell membrane anchor proteins and (ii) the physical forces required to deform the cell against its surface tension. Moreover, we provide a more rigorous treatment of intracellular diffusion and we revise some of the model parameter values in light of the experimental evidence now available. We derive a critical contraction parameter which links the chemical population dynamics of membrane-bound FtsZ molecules to the force of contraction. Using this parameter as a tool to predict the ability of the cell to initiate division, we are able to predict the division outcome in cells depleted of key FtsZ-binding proteins."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical outcomes and steroid side effects in a cohort of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treated with long-term daily glucocorticoid therapy. Although daily glucocorticoid therapy has been shown to extend ambulatory function in DMD, less frequent dosing is often used because of side effect concerns. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 97 patients with DMD aged 10 to <16 years treated with daily glucocorticoid (89% on deflazacort) for a mean of 8.5 years. Outcome measures were motor, pulmonary, and cardiac function, and scoliosis. Side effects were growth failure and weight gain, facial fullness, blood pressure, bone health, cataracts, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavior, hypertrichosis, and need for medication interventions. RESULTS: For 13- to 16-year-old patients, 40% could rise from the floor and 50% could perform the 30-foot run test. Forced vital capacity for the entire cohort was well preserved. Thirteen percent of younger (10- to <13-year-old) and 21% of older patients had findings of left ventricle systolic dysfunction. Six percent (all aged 16 years) developed scoliosis (Cobb angle >20 degrees). Eighty-six percent had normal weight velocities; 30% had no increased facial fullness; 72% had short stature; and 19% had asymptomatic cataracts. Asymptomatic spine compression deformities were noted in 76% and long bone fractures in 30%. One patient stopped glucocorticoid because of behavioral concerns. CONCLUSIONS: With evidence for improved outcomes and manageable side effects, we recommend use of daily glucocorticoid therapy for patients with DMD with anticipatory management of side effects and a coordinated interdisciplinary care approach."

The Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) is required for excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and is also present in the brain. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations result in \"leaky\" RyR2 channels due to the decreased binding of the calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) subunit, which stabilizes the closed state of the channel. We found that mice heterozygous for the R2474S mutation in Ryr2 (Ryr2-R2474S mice) exhibited spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures (which occurred in the absence of cardiac arrhythmias), exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Treatment with a novel RyR2-specific compound (S107) that enhances the binding of calstabin2 to the mutant Ryr2-R2474S channel inhibited the channel leak and prevented cardiac arrhythmias and raised the seizure threshold. Thus, CPVT-associated mutant leaky Ryr2-R2474S channels in the brain can cause seizures in mice, independent of cardiac arrhythmias. Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death."

The human APOBEC3 (A3) family (A, B, C, DE, F, G, and H) comprises host defense factors that potently inhibit the replication of diverse retroviruses, retrotransposons, and the other viral pathogens. HIV-1 has a counterstrategy that includes expressing the Vif protein to abrogate A3 antiviral function. Without Vif, A3 proteins, particularly APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), inhibit HIV-1 replication by blocking reverse transcription and/or integration and hypermutating nascent viral cDNA. The molecular mechanisms of this antiviral activity have been primarily attributed to two biochemical characteristics common to A3 proteins: catalyzing cytidine deamination in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a nucleic acid-binding capability that is specific to ssDNA or ssRNA. Recent advances suggest that unique property of A3G dimer/oligomer formations, is also important for the modification of antiviral activity. In this review article we summarize how A3 proteins, particularly A3G, inhibit viral replication based on the biochemical and structural characteristics of the A3G protein."

The mouse CAF1 (mCAF1) is an ortholog of the yeast (y) CAF1 protein, which is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, the major cytoplasmic deadenylase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although CAF1 protein belongs to the DEDDh family of RNases, CCR4 appears to be the principle deadenylase of the CCR4-NOT complex. Here, we present evidence that mCAF1 is a processive, 3'-5'-RNase with a preference for poly(A) substrates. Like CCR4, increased length of RNA substrates converted mCAF1 into a processive enzyme. In contrast to two other DEDD family members, PAN2 and PARN, mCAF1 was not activated either by PAB1 or capped RNA substrates. The rate of deadenylation in vitro by yCCR4 and mCAF1 were both strongly influenced by secondary structures present in sequences adjacent to the poly(A) tail, suggesting that the ability of both enzymes to deadenylate might be affected by the context of the mRNA 3'-untranslated region sequences. The ability of mCAF1 to complement a ycaf1 deletion in yeast, however, did not require the RNase function of mCAF1. Importantly, yCAF1 mutations, which have been shown to block its RNase activity in vitro, did not inactivate yCAF1 in vivo, and mRNAs were deadenylated in vivo at nearly the same rate as found for wild type yCAF1. These results indicate that at least in yeast the CAF1 RNase activity is not required for its in vivo function."

To clarify the discrepancies between published maps of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene region as well as the length of gaps in these assemblies and to validate the recently described tandem duplication of the human NF1 locus, we assembled a contiguous high-density map of BAC and PAC clones from different genomic libraries. Although two WI-12393-derived low-copy fragments are known to occur at the proximal and distal boundaries of the 1.5-Mb segment that is usually deleted in NF1 microdeletion patients, we identified an additional WI-12393-related segment between the MGC13061 and the NF1 gene, which appears to trigger interstitial deletions of smaller size as observed in two patients. Moreover, we completed the genomic organization and cDNA structure of all functional genes, CYTOR4, FLJ12735, FLJ22729, CENTA2, MGC13061, NF1, OMG, EVI2B, EVI2A, KIAA1821, MGC11316, HCA66, KIAA0160, and WI-12393, from this region.

Atrial fibrillation continues to be a challenging arrhythmia. There are some conventional, time-tested explanations of atrial fibrillation genesis, however some uncertainty of its complete understanding still exists. We focused on atrial ischemia which, hypothetically, could be responsible for manifestation of the arrhythmia, irrespective of the underlying heart disease. Evidences abounds that atrial fibrillation has an extremely strong association with nutritional/oxidative status of myocardium. This arrhythmia seemingly may stem from the electrophysiological differences taking place in the boundary areas. To validate such assumptions we have surveyed widely accepted theories based on clinical and experimental evidence. There was an attempt to integrate some well-known theoretical explanations (focal, multifocal, ectopic, reentrant activity, atrial remodeling, etc.) into a new conceptually systematized arrhythmogenesis. Confronting ischemic and non-ischemic atrial zones electrophysiologically on their borderlines presumably creates a substrate vulnerable to the development of atrial fibrillation. The behavior of these interrelated areas is likely ischemia-dependent; the separating borderline(s) may be treated as conflictogenic, releasing triggers/drivers to commence and to perpetuate the arrhythmia. Ischemically damaged and non-damaged myocardial areas likely participate in the relay-race carousel of arrhythmogenicity due to their mutual interactions, accompanied by the \"fireworks\" at the separating borderlines. It could be concluded that myocardial ischemia as a nonspecific proarrhythmic factor presumably plays a key role in the genesis and sustenance of atrial fibrillation. Theoretically the most important step in eradication of arrhythmogenic substrate might be an overall abolition of ischemia regardless of the characteristics of underlying heart disease. Innovative intellectual and explorative research is needed to render innocuous the ischemia that might help us win the century's cardioarrhythmological battle."

LY191145 is a p-chlorobenzyl derivative of LY264826 (A82846B) with activity against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. Incorporation of L-[14C]lysine into peptidoglycan of intact vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by LY191145 (50% inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 5 microgram/ml, respectively). Inhibition was accompanied by accumulation of UDP-muramyl-peptide precursors in the cytoplasm. This agent inhibited late-stage steps in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in permeabilized E. faecium when either the UDP-muramyl-pentapeptide precursor from vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium or the UDP-muramyl-pentadepsipeptide precursor from vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was used as a substrate. Inhibition of late-stage steps led to accumulation of an N-acetyl-[14C]glucosamine-labeled lipid intermediate indicative of inhibition of the transglycosylation step. Inhibition of peptidoglycan polymerization without affecting cross-linking in a particulate membrane-plus-wall-fragment assay from Aerococcus viridans was consistent with this explanation. The fact that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by LY191145 was not readily antagonized by an excess of free acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or acyl-D-alanyl-D-lactate ligands indicates that the manner in which this compound inhibits transglycosylation may not be identical to that of vancomycin."

We also found that mutant SAMHD1s of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome patients are defective in LINE-1 inhibition. Several domains of SAMHD1 are critical for LINE-1 regulation. SAMHD1 inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition in dividing cells. An enzymatic active site mutant SAMHD1 maintained substantial anti-LINE-1 activity. SAMHD1 inhibits ORF2p-mediated LINE-1 reverse transcription in isolated LINE-1 ribonucleoproteins by reducing ORF2p level.

In hippocampal slices, photolysis of MNI-D-aspartate (4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-D-aspartate) failed to elicit EAAC1-mediated transporter currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and D-aspartate uptake was not detected electron microscopically in spines. Using EAAC1 knock-out mice as negative controls to establish antibody specificity, we show that these relatively small amounts of EAAC1 protein are widely distributed in somata and dendrites of all hippocampal neurons. These findings raise new questions about how so few transporters can influence the activation of NMDA receptors at excitatory synapses."

Gordon syndrome or distal arthrogryposis type 3 is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by contractures of upper and lower limbs. It is distinguishable from other forms of distal arthrogryposis by cleft palate and short stature. Recently, Gordon syndrome has been associated to heterozygous mutations in the piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 2 gene (PIEZO2). Different mutations of this gene also cause distal arthrogryposis type 5 and Marden-Walker syndrome. Dysfunction of this ion channel provides pleiotropic effects on joints, ocular muscles, and bone development. Here, we present a family with three affected individuals exhibiting multiple contractures (metacarpo-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints as well as elbow, shoulder, knee, and ankle joints), clubfeet, short stature, bifid uvula/cleft palate, and a distinct facial phenotype including ptosis. In addition, mild intellectual disability and delay in psychomotor development are obvious. The multigenerational phenotypic spectrum of Gordon syndrome is present in the 37-year-old father, his 4-year-old son and a male neonate showing typical signs of arthrogryposis in the prenatal ultrasound examination already seen at 13 week of gestation. In all affected family members, we identified the PIEZO2 mutation c.8057G>A (p.Arg2686His) by Sanger sequencing. Our analysis indicated that mild delay in psychomotor development and intellectual disability could be part of the phenotypic spectrum of Gordon syndrome. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Sialyl Lewis x (sLe(x)) and sialyl Lewis a (sLe(a)) glycans are expressed on highly metastatic colon cancer cells. They promote extravasation of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis via interacting with E-selectin on endothelial cells. Recently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been noted as a critical phenotypic alteration in metastatic cancer cells. To address the association between sLe(x/a) expression and EMT, we assessed whether sLe(x/a) are highly expressed on colon cancer cells undergoing EMT. Treatment of HT29 and DLD-1 cells with EGF and/or basic FGF (bFGF) induced EMT and significantly increased sLe(x/a) expression resulting in enhanced E-selectin binding activity. The transcript levels of the glycosyltransferase genes ST3GAL1/3/4 and FUT3 were significantly elevated and that of FUT2 was significantly suppressed by the treatment. We provide evidence that ST3GAL1/3/4 and FUT3 are transcriptionally up-regulated by c-Myc with probable involvement of Ser62 phosphorylation, and that FUT2 is transcriptionally down-regulated through the attenuation of CDX2. The contribution of c-Myc and CDX2 to the sLe(x/a) induction was proved to be significant by knockdown or forced expression experiments. Interestingly, the cells undergoing EMT exhibited significantly increased VEGF secretion, which can promote tumor angiogenesis in cooperation with sLe(x/a). Finally, immunohistological study indicated high E-selectin ligand expression on cancer cells undergoing EMT in vivo, supporting their coexistence observed in vitro. These results suggest a significant link between sLe(x/a) expression and EMT in colon cancer cells and a pivotal role of c-Myc and CDX2 in regulating sLe(x/a) expression during EMT."

During a study of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom in Bulgaria, a previously unrecognized neurological disorder was encountered, mainly in Wallachian Gypsies, who represent a relatively recent genetic isolate. The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features. Fifty individuals from 19 extended pedigrees were identified and examined clinically and electrophysiologically. At least 1 patient from each family was admitted to the hospital in Sofia for full investigation. Pedigree analysis indicates autosomal recessive inheritance. The disorder is recognized in infancy by the presence of congenital cataracts and microcorneas. A predominantly motor neuropathy beginning in the lower limbs and later affecting the upper limbs develops during childhood and leads to severe disability by the third decade. Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some. Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy, confirmed by nerve biopsy. The CCFDN syndrome is thus a pleomorphic autosomal recessive disorder displaying a combination of neurological and nonneurological features."

During development, proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), candidate cells-of-origin for the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, requires signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the pathways of which are also implicated in medulloblastoma. One of the consequences of IGF signaling is inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-suppressing tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), comprised of TSC1 and TSC2, leading to increased mRNA translation. We show that mice, in which TSC function is impaired, display increased mTOR pathway activation, enhanced CGNP proliferation, glycogen synthase kinase-3 alpha/beta (GSK-3 alpha/beta) inactivation, and cytoplasmic localization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1), which has been proposed to cause its inactivation or gain of oncogenic functions. We observed the same characteristics in wild-type primary cultures of CGNPs in which TSC1 and/or TSC2 were knocked down, and in mouse medulloblastomas induced by ectopic Shh pathway activation. Moreover, Shh-induced mouse medulloblastomas manifested Akt-mediated TSC2 inactivation, and the mutant TSC2 allele synergized with aberrant Shh signaling to increase medulloblastoma incidence in mice. Driving exogenous TSC2 expression in Shh-induced medulloblastoma cells corrected p27(Kip1) localization and reduced proliferation. GSK-3 alpha/beta inactivation in the tumors in vivo and in primary CGNP cultures was mTOR-dependent, whereas p27(Kip1) cytoplasmic localization was regulated upstream of mTOR by TSC2. These results indicate that a balance between Shh mitogenic signaling and TSC function regulating new protein synthesis and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition is essential for the normal development and prevention of tumor formation or expansion."

VinaMPI uses a distribution scheme in which tasks are evenly distributed to the workers based on the complexity of each task, as defined by the number of rotatable bonds in each chemical compound investigated. VinaMPI efficiently handles multiple proteins in a ligand screen, allowing for high-throughput inverse docking that presents new opportunities for improving the efficiency of the drug discovery pipeline. VinaMPI successfully ran on 84,672 cores with a continual decrease in job completion time with increasing core count. The ratio of the number of tasks in a screening to the number of workers should be at least around 100 in order to have a good load balance and an optimal job completion time.

Permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) is diagnosed in the first three months of life and is a major management problem as patients require lifelong insulin injections. Recently, activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channels in the pancreatic beta-cells were found to be an important cause of PNDM. The mutated KATP channels do not close in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) so the beta-cell membrane is hyperpolarized and insulin secretion does not occur. Some patients have DEND syndrome (developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes) with the neurological features arising from mutated KATP channels in muscle, nerve and brain. Defining a genetic aetiology has not only given insights into clinical classification and disease mechanism, but has also influenced treatment. Sulphonylureas, by binding the sulphonylurea receptor, can close the KATP channel. This has led to patients who were insulin-dependent being able to discontinue insulin injections and achieve excellent control with sulphonylurea tablets. In this article we discuss the work that established Kir6.2 mutations as a common cause of neonatal diabetes, the clinical features, the underlying mechanism and the impact on patient treatment."

BACKGROUND: Candidate gene prioritization aims to identify promising new genes associated with a disease or a biological process from a larger set of candidate genes. In recent years, network-based methods - which utilize a knowledge network derived from biological knowledge - have been utilized for gene prioritization. Biological knowledge can be encoded either through the network's links or nodes. Current network-based methods can only encode knowledge through links. This paper describes a new network-based method that can encode knowledge in links as well as in nodes. RESULTS: We developed a new network inference algorithm called the Knowledge Network Gene Prioritization (KNGP) algorithm which can incorporate both link and node knowledge. The performance of the KNGP algorithm was evaluated on both synthetic networks and on networks incorporating biological knowledge. The results showed that the combination of link knowledge and node knowledge provided a significant benefit across 19 experimental diseases over using link knowledge alone or node knowledge alone. CONCLUSIONS: The KNGP algorithm provides an advance over current network-based algorithms, because the algorithm can encode both link and node knowledge. We hope the algorithm will aid researchers with gene prioritization."

Generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from somatic cells has been successfully achieved by ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, also known as the Yamanaka factors. In practice, initial iPS colonies are picked based on their embryonic stem (ES) cell-like morphology, but often may go on to fail subsequent assays, such as the alkaline phosphate (AP) assay. In this study, we co-expressed through lenti-viral delivery the Yamanaka factors in amniotic fluid-derived (AF) cells. ES-like colonies were picked onto a traditional feeder layer and a high percentage AF-iPS with partial to no AP activity was found. Interestingly, we obtained an overwhelming majority of fully stained AP positive (AP+) AF-iPS colonies when colonies were first seeded on a feeder-free culture system, and then transferred to a feeder layer for expansion. Furthermore, colonies with no AP activity were not detected. This screening step decreased the variation seen between morphology and AP assay. We observed the AF-iPS colonies grown on the feeder layer with 28% AP+ colonies, 45% AP partially positive (AP+/-) colonies and 27% AP negative (AP-) colonies, while colonies screened by the feeder-free system were 84% AP+ colonies, 16% AP+/- colonies and no AP- colonies. The feeder-free screened AP+ AF-iPS colonies were also positive for pluripotent markers, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 as well as having differentiation abilities into three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we report a simplistic, one-step method for selection of AP+ AF-iPS cells via feeder-free screening."

Multiciliated ependymal cells become fully differentiated at postnatal stages however they are specified during mid to late embryogenesis from a population of radial glial cells. Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically-confirmed inoperable melanoma or angiosarcoma refractory to standard treatment were allocated to treatment with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg intetumumab, administered once every 3 weeks for up to four cycles unless unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occurred. Extended dosing was available for patients who responded with stable disease or better. RESULTS: Eight patients received 10 mg/kg and 11 received 20 mg/kg intetumumab. Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between treatment groups; 18 patients had metastatic malignant melanoma and one had angiosarcoma. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Headache was the most common adverse event across both dose groups. Vomiting, nausea and chills were more common, and uveitic reactions lasted longer, in patients treated with 20 mg/kg compared with 10 mg/kg intetumumab. No patient developed antibodies to intetumumab. Intetumumab drug exposure as assessed by area under the curve and maximum serum concentration appeared to increase approximately dose-proportionally from 10 to 20 mg/kg, while volume of distribution remained constant for both doses. Stable disease was observed in two patients with metastatic malignant melanoma (one in each dose group) for at least 6 weeks.

RF and anti-CCP were significantly higher in smoker than non-smoker and in heavy than mild to moderate smoker patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). In smoker patients, both RF and anti-CCP antibodies correlated significantly and positively with smoking index (r\u00a0=\u00a00.581, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; r\u00a0=\u00a00.661, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Also, smoking index and anti-CCP correlated significantly and positively with disease stage (r\u00a0=\u00a00.424, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; r\u00a0=\u00a00.523, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). It appears from our results that, tobacco smoking mostly play a role in progression of rheumatoid arthritis through tissue protein citrullination. So all rheumatoid arthritis patients must quit completely to achieve a good control."

PURPOSE: To evaluate the duration and dose intensity of epirubicin-based regimens in premenopausal patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1990, 621 patients with operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive fluorouracil (Roche SA, Basel, Switzerland) 500 mg/m2, epirubicin (Pharmacia SA, Milan, Italy) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany) 500 mg/m2 every 21 days (FEC 50) for six cycles (6 FEC 50); FEC 50 for three cycles (3 FEC 50); or the same regimen with epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) for three cycles (3 FEC 75). All patients in the three arms received chest wall irradiation at the end of the third cycle. RESULTS: After a 131-month median follow-up, the 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 53.4%, 42.5%, and 43.6% (P =.05) in the three arms, respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was superior both to 3 FEC 50 (P =.02) and to 3 FEC 75 (P =.05). The 10-year overall survival (OS) for the 6 FEC 50 arm was 64.3%, for the 3 FEC 50 arm it was 56.6%, and for the 3 FEC 75 arm, it was 59.7% (P =.25), respectively. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate that 6 FEC 50 was more effective than 3 FEC 50 (P =.10). Cox regression analysis demonstrates that OS was significantly better in the 6 FEC 50 than in the 3 FEC 50 arm (P =.046). No severe infections (grade 3 to 4), acute cardiac toxicity, or deaths from toxicity have been observed. Only five patients developed delayed cardiac dysfunctions, and three patients developed acute myeloblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: After a long-term follow-up in an adjuvant setting, the benefit of six cycles of FEC 50 compared with three cycles, whatever the dose, is highly significant in terms of DFS. As regards OS, the group receiving six cycles of FEC 50 has significantly better results than the group receiving three cycles of FEC 50."

BACKGROUND: The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomes. Most of the meiotic segregation studies of human Robertsonian translocations have been performed on common t(13;14) and t(14;21) translocations. Analysis of the chromosomal constitution in sperm of Robertsonian translocation carriers is of great interest for assessing the risk of unbalanced forms and adapting genetic counselling. In the present study, we present the first meiotic segregation study of a t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation in human sperm. METHODS: A total of 11 787 sperm nuclei were scored using two distinct FISH labelling techniques, i.e. the locus-specific probes (LSI) method and the whole chromosome painting (WCP) technique. RESULTS: The frequency of normal or balanced sperm resulting from alternate meiotic segregation was 86%. Incidences of unbalanced complements resulting from adjacent segregation modes were 12.79% and 14.36% in LSI and WCP assays, respectively. No significant excess of nullisomy or disomy for the affected chromosomes was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Similar results in segregation were obtained with the two techniques, demonstrating the efficiency of the two strategies for the direct segregation analysis of Roberstsonian translocations. The results obtained indicated a moderate meiotic production of imbalance. This study shows that the rare Robertsonian translocation (13;22) displays a similar distribution of balanced and unbalanced sperm patterns as the common Robertsonian translocations previously studied. This suggests that the behaviour of acrocentric chromosomes was similar in all cases of centric fusion."

BACKGROUND: The anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab reduced disease activity in a phase 2 trial of previously untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of first-line alemtuzumab compared with interferon beta 1a in a phase 3 trial. METHODS: In our 2 year, rater-masked, randomised controlled phase 3 trial, we enrolled adults aged 18-50 years with previously untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio by an interactive voice response system, stratified by site, to receive intravenous alemtuzumab 12 mg per day or subcutaneous interferon beta 1a 44 \u03bcg. Interferon beta 1a was given three-times per week and alemtuzumab was given once per day for 5 days at baseline and once per day for 3 days at 12 months. Coprimary endpoints were relapse rate and time to 6 month sustained accumulation of disability in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00530348. FINDINGS: 187 (96%) of 195 patients randomly allocated interferon beta 1a and 376 (97%) of 386 patients randomly allocated alemtuzumab were included in the primary analyses. 75 (40%) patients in the interferon beta 1a group relapsed (122 events) compared with 82 (22%) patients in the alemtuzumab group (119 events; rate ratio 0\u00b745 [95% CI 0\u00b732-0\u00b763]; p<0.0001), corresponding to a 54\u00b79% improvement with alemtuzumab. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, 59% of patients in the interferon beta 1a group were relapse-free at 2 years compared with 78% of patients in the alemtuzumab group (p<0\u00b70001). 20 (11%) of patients in the interferon beta 1a group had sustained accumulation of disability compared with 30 (8%) in the alemtuzumab group (hazard ratio 0\u00b770 [95% CI 0\u00b740-1\u00b723]; p=0\u00b722). 338 (90%) of patients in the alemtuzumab group had infusion-associated reactions; 12 (3%) of which were regarded as serious. Infections, predominantly of mild or moderate severity, occurred in 253 (67%) patients treated with alemtuzumab versus 85 (45%) patients treated with interferon beta 1a. 62 (16%) patients treated with alemtuzumab had herpes infections (predominantly cutaneous) compared with three (2%) patients treated with interferon beta 1a. By 24 months, 68 (18%) patients in the alemtuzumab group had thyroid-associated adverse events compared with 12 (6%) in the interferon beta 1a group, and three (1%) had immune thrombocytopenia compared with none in the interferon beta 1a group. Two patients in the alemtuzumab group developed thyroid papillary carcinoma. INTERPRETATION: Alemtuzumab's consistent safety profile and benefit in terms of reductions of relapse support its use for patients with previously untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; however, benefit in terms of disability endpoints noted in previous trials was not observed here.

The eukaryotic transcription elongation factor DSIF [DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) sensitivity-inducing factor] is composed of two subunits, hSpt4 and hSpt5, which are homologous to the yeast factors Spt4 and Spt5. DSIF is involved in regulating the processivity of RNA polymerase II and plays an essential role in transcriptional activation of eukaryotes. At several eukaryotic promoters, DSIF, together with NELF (negative elongation factor), leads to promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II. In the present paper we describe the crystal structure of hSpt4 in complex with the dimerization region of hSpt5 (amino acids 176-273) at a resolution of 1.55 A (1 A=0.1 nm). The heterodimer shows high structural similarity to its homologue from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, hSpt5-NGN is structurally similar to the NTD (N-terminal domain) of the bacterial transcription factor NusG. A homologue for hSpt4 has not yet been found in bacteria. However, the archaeal transcription factor RpoE\" appears to be distantly related. Although a comparison of the NusG-NTD of Escherichia coli with hSpt5 revealed a similarity of the three-dimensional structures, interaction of E. coli NusG-NTD with hSpt4 could not be observed by NMR titration experiments. A conserved glutamate residue, which was shown to be crucial for dimerization in yeast, is also involved in the human heterodimer, but is substituted for a glutamine residue in Escherichia coli NusG. However, exchanging the glutamine for glutamate proved not to be sufficient to induce hSpt4 binding."

The local expression of proteins involved in handling glutamate may be regulated by the number and activity of synapses in regions of glutamatergic innervation. The systematically varying innervation of inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea provides a model to test this suggestion. IHCs are glutamatergic and form a single row along the cochlear spiral. Along this row the number of afferent fibers terminating on IHCs increases toward the base, reaching a peak and thereafter declining. The afferents are segregated so that higher spontaneous rate fibers terminate on the pillar-cell side of the IHC and lower rate fibers terminate on the modiolar side. Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral. Immunofluorescent labeling for GLAST in IHC supporting cells increased in intensity to a peak in the region of 6-9 mm from the apex. Immunogold labeling for GLAST was greater overall in these cells in the 10 mm region than in the 1 mm region and also on the pillar-cell side of the IHC compared with the modiolar side. Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical outcomes and steroid side effects in a cohort of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treated with long-term daily glucocorticoid therapy. Although daily glucocorticoid therapy has been shown to extend ambulatory function in DMD, less frequent dosing is often used because of side effect concerns. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 97 patients with DMD aged 10 to <16 years treated with daily glucocorticoid (89% on deflazacort) for a mean of 8.5 years. Outcome measures were motor, pulmonary, and cardiac function, and scoliosis. Side effects were growth failure and weight gain, facial fullness, blood pressure, bone health, cataracts, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavior, hypertrichosis, and need for medication interventions. RESULTS: For 13- to 16-year-old patients, 40% could rise from the floor and 50% could perform the 30-foot run test. Forced vital capacity for the entire cohort was well preserved. Thirteen percent of younger (10- to <13-year-old) and 21% of older patients had findings of left ventricle systolic dysfunction. Six percent (all aged 16 years) developed scoliosis (Cobb angle >20 degrees). Eighty-six percent had normal weight velocities; 30% had no increased facial fullness; 72% had short stature; and 19% had asymptomatic cataracts. Asymptomatic spine compression deformities were noted in 76% and long bone fractures in 30%. One patient stopped glucocorticoid because of behavioral concerns. CONCLUSIONS: With evidence for improved outcomes and manageable side effects, we recommend use of daily glucocorticoid therapy for patients with DMD with anticipatory management of side effects and a coordinated interdisciplinary care approach."

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major risk factor for stroke. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. In the pivotal phase III trial ROCKET AF, rivaroxaban demonstrated non-inferiority compared with warfarin for reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF (intention-to-treat analysis), without an increased risk of major bleeding. Superior efficacy vs. warfarin was achieved while patients were on study medication. Other direct oral factor Xa inhibitors have completed phase III clinical trials in this indication. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF. Baseline stroke risk, as indicated by CHADS2 scores, was lower in patients in the ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE-AF trials than in ROCKET AF. OBJECTIVES: This review discusses the main findings from ROCKET AF, specifically examining recent subgroup analyses investigating rivaroxaban use across various patient types at high risk for adverse outcomes, including those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack, reduced renal function, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or patients aged > \u00a075\u00a0years and those resident in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: These subgroup analyses demonstrate that the treatment effect for rivaroxaban vs. warfarin is broadly consistent across a wide range of patient groups, with respect to both efficacy and safety."

In acute TBI, we recently found decreased CSF levels of hypocretin-1, a wake-promoting neurotransmitter. In the present study, we aimed to delineate the frequency and clinical characteristics of post-traumatic SWD, to assess CSF hypocretin-1 levels 6 months after TBI, and to identify risk factors for posttraumatic SWD. A total of 96 consecutive patients were enrolled within the first 4 days after TBI. Six months later, out of 76 TBI patients, who did not die and who did not move to foreign countries, we included 65 patients (86%, 53 males, mean age 39 years) in our study. Patients were examined using interviews, questionnaires, clinical examinations, computed tomography of the brain, laboratory tests (including CSF hypocretin-1 levels, and HLA typing), conventional polysomnography, maintenance of wakefulness and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) and actigraphy. Potential causes of post-traumatic SWD were assessed according to international criteria. New-onset sleep-wake disturbances following TBI were found in 47 patients (72%): subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS; defined by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale > or = 10) was found in 18 (28%), objective EDS (as defined by mean sleep latency < 5 min on MSLT) in 16 (25%), fatigue (daytime tiredness without signs of subjective or objective EDS) in 11 (17%), post-traumatic hypersomnia 'sensu strictu' (increased sleep need of > or = 2 h per 24 h compared to pre-TBI) in 14 (22%) patients and insomnia in 3 patients (5%). In 28 patients (43% of the study population), we could not identify a specific cause of the post-traumatic SWD other than TBI. Low CSF hypocretin-1 levels were found in 4 of 21 patients 6 months after TBI, as compared to 25 of 27 patients in the first days after TBI. Hypocretin levels 6 months after TBI were significantly lower in patients with post-traumatic EDS. There were no associations between post-traumatic SWD and severity or localization of TBI, general clinical outcome, gender, pathological neurological findings and HLA typing. However, post-traumatic SWD correlated with impaired quality of life. These results suggest that sleep-wake disturbances, particularly EDS, fatigue and hypersomnia are common after TBI, and significantly impair quality of life. In almost one out of two patients, post-traumatic SWD appear to be directly related to the TBI. An involvement of the hypocretin system in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic SWD appears possible. Other risk factors predisposing towards the development of post-traumatic SWD were not identified."

The transcription elongation factor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) regulates RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) processivity by promoting, in concert with negative elongation factor (NELF), promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII. DSIF is also reportedly involved in transcriptional activation. However, the role of DSIF in transcriptional activation by DNA-binding activators is unclear. Here we show that DSIF acts cooperatively with a DNA-binding activator, Gal4-VP16, to promote transcriptional activation. In the absence of DSIF, Gal4-VP16-activated transcription resulted in frequent pausing of RNAPII during elongation in vitro. The presence of DSIF reduced pausing, thereby supporting Gal4-VP16-mediated activation. We found that DSIF exerts its positive effects within a short time-frame from initiation to elongation, and that NELF does not affect the positive regulatory function of DSIF. Knockdown of the gene encoding the large subunit of DSIF, human Spt5 (hSpt5), in HeLa cells reduced Gal4-VP16-mediated activation of a reporter gene, but had no effect on expression in the absence of activator. Together, these results provide evidence that higher-level transcription has a stronger requirement for DSIF, and that DSIF contributes to efficient transcriptional activation by preventing RNAPII pausing during transcription elongation."

Despite wide acceptance, there is controversy about the meaning and use of the principles in clinical practice as a checklist for moral behaviour. Recent attempts by medical regulatory authorities to use the four principles to judge medical practitioner behaviour have not met with success in clarifying how these principles can be incorporated into a legal framework. This may reflect the philosophical debate about the relationship between law and morals. In this paper, legal decisions from two cases in which general practitioners have been charged with professional shortcomings are discussed. Difficulties with the application of the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice) to judge medical practitioner behaviour are highlighted. The four principles are relevant to medical practitioner behaviour, but if applied as justifications for disciplinary decisions without explanation, perverse results may ensue. Solutions are suggested to minimise ambiguities in the application of the four principles: adjudicators should acknowledge the difference between professional and common morality and the statutory requirement to give decisions with reasons."

INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression via degradation or translational repression of their targeted mRNAs. It is known that aberrant microRNA expression can play important roles in cancer, but the role of microRNAs in autoimmune diseases is only beginning to emerge. In this study, the expression of selected microRNAs is examined in rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and healthy and disease control individuals, and the expression of miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, miR-16, and microRNA let-7a was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Rheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited between 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold increases in miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, and miR-16 expression, whereas let-7a expression was not significantly different compared with healthy control individuals. In addition, two targets of miR-146a, namely tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), were similarly expressed between rheumatoid arthritis patients and control individuals, despite increased expression of miR-146a in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Repression of TRAF6 and/or IRAK-1 in THP-1 cells resulted in up to an 86% reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha production, implicating that normal miR-146a function is critical for the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. CONCLUSIONS: Recent studies have shown that synovial tissue and synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis exhibit increased expression of certain microRNAs. Our data thus demonstrate that microRNA expression in rheumatoid arthritis peripheral blood mononuclear cells mimics that of synovial tissue/fibroblasts. The increased microRNA expression in rheumatoid arthritis patients is potentially useful as a marker for disease diagnosis, progression, or treatment efficacy, but this will require confirmation using a large and well defined cohort. Our data also suggest a possible mechanism contributing to rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, whereby miR-146a expression is increased but unable to properly function, leading to prolonged tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), first identified in Xanthomonas bacteria, are naturally occurring or artificially designed proteins that modulate gene transcription. These proteins recognize and bind DNA sequences based on a variable numbers of tandem repeats. Each repeat is comprised of a set of \u223c 34 conserved amino acids; within this conserved domain, there are usually two amino acids that distinguish one TALE from another. Interestingly, TALEs have revealed a simple cipher for the one-to-one recognition of proteins for DNA bases. Synthetic TALEs have been used to successfully target genes in a variety of species, including humans. Depending on the type of functional domain that is fused to the TALE of interest, these proteins can have diverse biological effects. For example, after binding DNA, TALEs fused to transcriptional activation domains can function as robust transcription factors (TALE-TFs), while fused to restriction endonucleases (TALENs) can cut DNA. Targeted genome editing, in theory, is capable of modifying any endogenous gene sequence of interest; this can be performed in cells or organisms, and may be applied to clinical gene-based therapies in the future. With current technologies, highly accurate, specific, and reliable gene editing cannot be achieved. Thus, recognition and binding mechanisms governing TALE biology are currently hot research areas. In this review, we summarize the major advances in TALE technology over the past several years with a focus on the interaction between TALEs and DNA, TALE design and construction, potential applications for this technology, and unique characteristics that make TALEs superior to zinc finger endonucleases."

The local expression of proteins involved in handling glutamate may be regulated by the number and activity of synapses in regions of glutamatergic innervation. The systematically varying innervation of inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea provides a model to test this suggestion. IHCs are glutamatergic and form a single row along the cochlear spiral. Along this row the number of afferent fibers terminating on IHCs increases toward the base, reaching a peak and thereafter declining. The afferents are segregated so that higher spontaneous rate fibers terminate on the pillar-cell side of the IHC and lower rate fibers terminate on the modiolar side. Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral. Immunofluorescent labeling for GLAST in IHC supporting cells increased in intensity to a peak in the region of 6-9 mm from the apex. Immunogold labeling for GLAST was greater overall in these cells in the 10 mm region than in the 1 mm region and also on the pillar-cell side of the IHC compared with the modiolar side. Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence. The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling. VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient. These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST."

RATIONALE: Gender differences in cardiovascular disease have long been recognized and attributed to beneficial cardiovascular actions of estrogen. Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as key modulators of heart disease by repressing the activity of the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 transcription factor, which promotes pathological cardiac remodeling in response to stress. Although it is proposed that HDACs additionally influence nuclear receptor signaling, the effect of class II HDACs on gender differences in cardiovascular disease remains unstudied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effect of class II HDACs on post-myocardial infarction remodeling in male and female mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we show that the absence of HDAC5 or -9 in female mice protects against maladaptive remodeling following myocardial infarction, during which there is an upregulation of estrogen-responsive genes in the heart. This genetic reprogramming coincides with a pronounced increase in expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)alpha gene, which we show to be a direct MEF2 target gene. ERalpha also directly interacts with class II HDACs. Cardioprotection resulting from the absence of HDAC5 or -9 in female mice can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced neoangiogenesis in the infarcted region via upregulation of the ER target gene vascular endothelial growth factor-a. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a novel gender-specific pathway of cardioprotection mediated by ERalpha and its regulation by MEF2 and class II HDACs."

In addition, the proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL) form a heterodimer that drives the Per genes via the E-box consensus sequences within their promoter regions. In the present study, we demonstrate that Id2 is involved in stabilization of the amplitudes of the circadian oscillations by suppressing transcriptional activation of clock genes Clock and Bmal1. Id2 shows dynamic oscillation in the SCN, with a peak in the late subjective night. Under constant dark conditions (DD), Id2(-/-) mice showed no apparent difference in locomotor activity, however, under constant light conditions (LL), Id2(-/-) mice exhibit aberrant locomotor activity, with lower circadian oscillation amplitudes, although the free running periods in Id2(-/-) mice show no differences from those in either wild type or heterozygous mice. Id2(-/-) animals also exhibit upregulation of Per1 in constant light, during both the subjective night and day. In wild type mice, Id2 is upregulated by constant light exposure during the subjective night. We propose that Id2 expression in the SCN contributes to maintenance of dynamic circadian oscillations."

A simple genetic system has been developed to test the effect of over-expression of wild-type or mutated human MutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) proteins on methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) in Escherichia coli. The system relies on detection of Lac(+) revertants using MMR-proficient or MMR-deficient E. coli strains carrying a lac +1 frameshift mutation expressing hMLH1 proteins. We report that expression of wild-type hMLH1 protein causes an approx. 19-fold increase in mutation rates. The mutator phenotype was due to the ability of hMLH1 protein to interact with bacterial MutL and MutS proteins, thereby interfering with the formation of complexes between MMR proteins and mismatched DNA. Conversely, expression of proteins encoded by alleles deriving from hereditary-non-polyposis-colon-cancer (HNPCC) families decreases mutation rates, depending on the specific amino acid substitutions. These effects parallel the MutL-and MutS-binding and ATP-binding/hydrolysis activities of the mutated proteins."

Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is the first INSTI-based single-tablet regimen available for the complete initial treatment of adults with HIV-1 infection. In two large, randomized, double-blind, phase III trials, once-daily treatment with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF was effective in reducing plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to <50 copies/mL at the week 48 assessment and showed virological efficacy noninferior to that of the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF single-tablet regimen or a once-daily regimen of atazanavir plus ritonavir (ritonavir-boosted atazanavir) plus the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF. Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF also showed durable efficacy in terms of achieving sustained suppression of HIV-1 RNA levels to <50 copies/mL for up to 144 weeks in both of the phase III trials. Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF is an important addition to the group of simplified once-daily single-tablet regimens currently available for the effective treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral therapy-na\u00efve patients and is among the preferred regimens recommended for use as initial treatment. It offers advantages over more complex multiple-tablet regimens that may impair treatment adherence, which is fundamental to the successful management of HIV-1 infection."

A major challenge of current high-throughput sequencing experiments is not only the generation of the sequencing data itself but also their processing, storage and transmission. The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files. In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve >99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations."

BACKGROUND: Aseptic meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is characterized by meningeal inflammation that is not linked to identifiable bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of aseptic meningitis caused by herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex types I and II (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 196 CSF samples were collected from patients with suspected meningitis. All samples were smear- and culture-negative for bacterial pathogens. The biochemical and cytological findings of CSF samples were also recorded. DNA was extracted from samples and PCR with specific primers was carried out to detect viruses. RESULTS: The 196 samples derived from 100 (52%) men and 96 (48%) women ranging in age from one day to 86 years with an average age of 32.3 \u00b1 25.3 years. Of them, 8 (4.08%) samples yielded positive results, including 5 (2.55%) cases of VZV infection and 3 (1.53%) cases of HSV-1 infection. No cases of HSV-2, CMV or EBV infection were detected. CSF protein and glucose levels among positive cases were all in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a considerable rate of herpesvirus infection in patients with aseptic meningitis, and that VZV is the most common herpesvirus to cause infection followed by HSV-1. Our results also showed that a moderate increase in the WBC count and predominance of lymphocytes can be valuable clues in diagnosing viral meningitis. Given the different approaches of drug therapy in bacterial and viral meningitis, use of molecular methods is necessary in hospitals to rapidly discriminate between them."

Through the movement of their motile cilia, ependymal cells control the cerebrospinal fluid flow within the ventricular system from which they receive secreted molecules and morphogens controlling self-renewal and differentiation decisions of adult neural stem cells. Multiciliated ependymal cells become fully differentiated at postnatal stages however they are specified during mid to late embryogenesis from a population of radial glial cells. Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1."

The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity and insulin resistance, is dramatically increasing in Western and developing countries. This disorder is not only associated with a higher risk of appearance of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events, but impacts on the liver in different ways. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation of MetS, and is characterized by triglyceride accumulation and a variable degree of hepatic injury, inflammation, and repair. In the presence of significant hepatocellular injury and inflammation, the picture is defined 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis' (NASH), that has the potential to progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Diagnosis of NASH is based on a liver biopsy, and active search for noninvasive tests is ongoing. Progression of steatohepatitis to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis has been shown in at least one third of patients followed with paired biopsies. Presence of NASH is associated with lower life expectancy, both due to liver-related death and to an increase in cardiovascular events. The appearance of NAFLD is mainly dependent on increased flow of fatty acids derived from an excess of lipolysis from insulin-resistant adipose tissue. Development of NASH is based on lipotoxicity and is influenced by signals derived from outside the liver and from intrahepatic activation of inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways. The presence of the MetS is also associated with worse outcomes in patients with cirrhosis due to any causes, and has complex interactions with hepatitis C virus infection. Moreover, MetS poses a higher risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma, not necessarily through the development of NASH-related cirrhosis. In conclusion, the presence of metabolic alterations has a severe and multifaceted impact on the liver, and is responsible for a higher risk of liver-dependent and -independent mortality."

During clinical experience with the \"atypical\" neuroleptic drugs clozapine, risperidone, and zotepine, some patients have shown a marked weight gain. To prove whether weight gain is a relevant side effect of atypical neuroleptics, the charts of all patients admitted with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder in the years 1991 to 1995 were evaluated. A retrospective chart review was performed, which included all patients who were treated longer than 2 weeks with a single neuroleptic. The data analysis showed that weight gain must be considered as a common side effect of atypical neuroleptics (clozapine, risperidone, sulpiride, or zotepine). The mean weight gain (3.1, 1.5, 1.9, or 4.3 kg, respectively) was significantly higher than that of patients treated with \"classic\" neuroleptics (mean, 0.0-0.5 kg) (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.01). Young and not obese patients show the highest weight increase. Because weight gain occurs in the first weeks of treatment, particularly in previously untreated subjects, this side effect has to be considered in view of compliance with long-term neuroleptic medication."

Proliferative vitreo retinopathy (PVR) is associated with extracellular matrix membrane (ECM) formation on the neural retina and disruption of the multilayered retinal architecture leading to distorted vision and blindness. During disease progression in PVR, retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) lose cell-cell adhesion, undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and deposit ECM leading to tissue fibrosis. The EMT process is mediated via exposure to vitreous cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-\u03b22. Previous studies have shown that Na,K-ATPase is required for maintaining a normal polarized epithelial phenotype and that decreased Na,K-ATPase function and subunit levels are associated with TGF-\u03b21-mediated EMT in kidney cells. In contrast to the basolateral localization of Na,K-ATPase in most epithelia, including kidney, Na,K-ATPase is found on the apical membrane in RPE cells. We now show that EMT is also associated with altered Na,K-ATPase expression in RPE cells. TGF-\u03b22 treatment of ARPE-19 cells resulted in a time-dependent decrease in Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 mRNA and protein levels while Na,K-ATPase \u03b11 levels, Na,K-ATPase activity, and intracellular sodium levels remained largely unchanged. In TGF-\u03b22-treated cells reduced Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 mRNA inversely correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 levels and analysis of the Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 promoter revealed a putative hypoxia response element (HRE). HIF-1\u03b1 bound to the Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 promoter and inhibiting the activity of HIF-1\u03b1 blocked the TGF-\u03b22 mediated Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 decrease suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 plays a potential role in Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 regulation during EMT in RPE cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 in ARPE-19 cells was associated with a change in cell morphology from epithelial to mesenchymal and induction of EMT markers such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, suggesting that loss of Na,K-ATPase \u03b21 is a potential contributor to TGF-\u03b22-mediated EMT in RPE cells."

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Congenital cardiovascular (c-v) malformations are the leading signs of two syndromes of highly variable phenotypes, the DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), both of which in the majority of cases are caused by microdeletion in the chromosome region 22q11.2. It was the aim of this study to ascertain the frequency of these chromosomal abnormalities in patients with unselected congenital cardiovascular malformation, and to assess the type of c-v malformation for which microdeletion analysis of the mentioned region would be indicated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort consisted of 90 patients with congenital c-v malformations (35 males, 55 females; mean age 3.6 years (19th week of pregnancy-36 years). Most of them were newborns. The c-v anomalies were: ventricular septal defect (n = 20), pulmonary atresia (10), Fallot's tetralogy (9), truncus arteriosus communis (6), aortic valve stenosis (6), atrioventricular canal (6), type B interrupted aortic arch (5), atrial septal defect (5), tricuspid atresia (4), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (4), persisting ductus arteriosus (3), pulmonary valve stenosis (3), complete (third degree) atrioventricular block (2), Ebstein's anomaly (1), tachycardia (1) and enlarged right atrium (1). Four of 14 fetuses included in this study had complex cardiac anomalies that could not be definitively classified. Cytogenetic karyotype analysis was unremarkable in all cases. Microdeletion detection was done by fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: 14 of the 90 cases (about 16%) showed microdeletion in the examined chromosomal region 22q11.2. Among the group with microdeletion were aortic arch interruption (5/5), ventricular septal defect (2/20). Fallot's tetralogy (1/9) and atrial septal defect (1/5). All the deletion carriers had other signs of the DGS/VCFS complex. One parent each in two of the microdeletion patients had the same microdeletions. CONCLUSION: In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition to conventional cytogenetic testing. The incidence of this microdeletion seems to be especially high among patients with type B interrupted aortic arch."

Using the EpFosER mammary tumour model we show that during EMT, upregulation of the transcriptional regulator deltaEF1 coincided with transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. Ectopic expression of deltaEF1 in epithelial cells was sufficient to downregulate E-cadherin and to induce EMT. Analysis of E-cadherin promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified deltaEF1 as direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human cancer cells, transcript levels of deltaEF1 correlated directly with the extent of E-cadherin repression and loss of the epithelial phenotype. The protein was enriched in nuclei of human cancer cells and physically associated with the E-cadherin promoter. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of deltaEF1 in cancer cells was sufficient to derepress E-cadherin expression and restore cell to cell adhesion, suggesting that deltaEF1 is a key player in late stage carcinogenesis."

Consistent benefits of apixaban over warfarin were also seen for major bleeding in East Asian (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.80) and non-East Asian (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62-0.83) patients (interaction P = .17). There was a greater reduction in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin in East Asian (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35-0.67) than in non-East Asian (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.79) patients (interaction P = .03). Numerically higher rates of intracranial bleeding were seen in East Asian patients with warfarin but not with apixaban. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban resulted in similar reductions in stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and greater reductions in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in patients from East Asia. Warfarin is associated with more intracranial bleeding, particularly in patients from East Asia."

Implications for altered RNA processing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurological disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration in association with neurofilament (NF) aggregate formation. This process is accompanied by an alteration in the stoichiometry of NF subunit protein expression such that the steady state levels of the low molecular weight NF (NFL) mRNA levels are selectively suppressed. We have previously shown that each of TDP-43, 14-3-3 and mutant SOD1 can function as NFL mRNA 3'UTR binding proteins that directly affect the stability of NFL transcripts. In this study, we demonstrate that the interaction of TDP-43 with the NFL mRNA 3' UTR involves ribonucleotide (UG) motifs present on stem loops of the 3'UTR as well as the RRM1 and RRM2 motifs of TDP-43. Ex vivo, TDP-43, 14-3-3 and SOD1 proteins interact to modulate NFL mRNA stability, although in vivo, only TDP-43 and either mutant or wild-type SOD1 co-localize in ALS motor neurons. TDP-43 was observed to co-localize to RNA transport granules (Staufen immunoreactive) in both control and ALS spinal motor neurons. In contrast, both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43. Using RNA-IP-PCR, we further demonstrate that NFL mRNA is preferentially sequestered to both stress granules and P-bodies in ALS. These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process."

Recently, array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) have been useful tools for the identification and mapping of deletions and duplications at higher resolution and throughput. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome caused by deletion or mutation of the retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1) gene and is often associated with a chromosome 17p11.2 deletion. We report here on the clinical and molecular analysis of a 10-year-old girl with SMS and moyamoya disease (occlusion of the circle of Willis). We have employed a combination of aCGH, FISH, and MLPA to characterize an approximately 6.3 Mb deletion spanning chromosome region 17p11.2-p13.1 in this patient, with the proximal breakpoint within the RAI1 gene. Further, investigation of the genomic architecture at the breakpoint intervals of this large deletion documented the presence of palindromic repeat elements that could potentially form recombination substrates leading to unequal crossover."

Here we discuss recent advancements in iPSC reprogramming and introduce mathematical approaches to help map the landscape between cell states during reprogramming. Our modelization indicates that OSKM expression diminishes and/or changes potential barriers between cell states and that epigenetic remodeling facilitate these transitions. From a practical perspective, the modeling approaches outlined here allow us to predict the time necessary to create a given number of iPSC colonies or the number of reprogrammed cells generated in a given time. Additional investigations will help to further refine modeling strategies, rendering them applicable toward the study of the development and stability of cancer cells or even other reprogramming processes such as lineage conversion. Ultimately, a quantitative understanding of cell state transitions might facilitate the establishment of regenerative medicine strategies and enhance the translation of reprogramming technologies into the clinic."

BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have shown that pembrolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared with ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. However, there has been no published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for this indication. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve patients with unresectable or meta-static melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective. METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed, which divided overall survival time into progression-free survival and postprogression survival. The model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Extrapolation of progression-free survival and overall survival beyond the clinical trial was based on parametric functions and literature data. The base-case time horizon was 20 years, and costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Clinical data-including progression-free survival and overall survival data spanning a median follow-up time of 15 months, as well as quality of life and adverse event data from the ongoing KEYNOTE-006 trial-and cost data from public sources were used to populate the model. Costs included those of drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and disease management of advanced melanoma. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost difference per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was the main outcome, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab was projected to increase the life expectancy of U.S. patients with advanced melanoma by 1.14 years, corresponding to a gain of 0.79 discounted QALYs over ipilimumab. The model also projected an average increase of $63,680 in discounted perpatient costs of treatment with pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab. The corresponding ICER was $81,091 per QALY ($68,712 per life-year) over a 20-year time horizon. With $100,000 per QALY as the threshold, when input parameters were varied in deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses, the use of pembrolizumab was cost-effective relative to ipilimumab in most ranges. Further, in a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the ICER was cost-effective in 83% of the simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab had higher expected QALYs and was cost-effective for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective.

However, the real contribution of FISH analysis in the cytogenetic diagnosis of MDS has not been well defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH studies are able to reveal chromosomal abnormalities in MDS patients undetected by conventional cytogenetics. One hundred seventy-four FISH studies were performed on bone marrow samples of 60 patients with MDS. The number of FISH studies in each patient was variable (1-5). FISH studies confirmed the G-banding cytogenetic findings in 99.4% (153/154) of samples and detected cytogenetic abnormalities in 25% (5/20) of cases in which the conventional cytognetic study failed. These results indicate that FISH studies provide relevant information in MSD in which the conventional cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful but add little value to a normal katyotype in conventional cytogenetic analysis."

UNLABELLED: We compared and contrasted the mechanism of action for the cysteine knot protein subfamily, Wise and Sost (Sclerostin). Our data suggest that functional interactions between Sost or Wise and LRP5/LRP6 have the potential to regulate bone deposition by modulating the Wnt pathway. INTRODUCTION: The human disease sclerosteosis exhibits an increase in bone mass thought to be caused by hyperactive osteoblasts. Sclerostin, SOST, the gene affected in this disease, has been postulated to exert its activity by functioning as a BMP antagonist. However, recent evidence indicates that SOST is highly related to Wise, which can also modulate the Wnt pathway by binding to LRP5 and LRP6. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we used cell culture to test the BMP and Wnt activity function of both Wise and Sost. In addition, we used Xenopus in vivo Wnt assays along with Xenopus in vitro Wnt assays to support our cell culture results. Epitope tagged cell supernatants containing either Sost or soluble mutant or wildtype LRP5/LRP6 were used for immunoprecipitation. Sost immunoprecipitation results were confirmed in vivo using cell culture. Finally, to support our in vitro data, we co-localized Sost, Wise, LRP5, and LRP6 in mouse long bone sections. RESULTS: In this study, we report in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that Sost physically interacts with Lrp5 and Lrp6 and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, using in vitro and in vivo assays, we showed that a variant of LRP5 (LRP5(G171V)) known to cause the human high bone mass (HBM) trait and a homologous change in LRP6 (LRP6(G158V)) abolished protein interactions with Sost. We used variants of Sost amino acids to further identify the contact points between Sost and LRP6. In Xenopus and mammalian cell culture assays, we showed that SOST is able to attenuate Wnt signaling and that this attenuation can be rescued by the addition of alpha-Sost antibodies or by the introduction of single amino acid substitution that alter its binding to LRP6. Sost differs from Wise in that it is unable to stimulate Wnt signaling. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that Sost and Wise are co-localized to osteoblasts, along with LRP5 and LRP6. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that functional interactions between Sost or Wise and LRPs have the potential to regulate bone deposition by modulating Wnt signaling."

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is universally used to recognize and remove many types of DNA damage. In eubacteria, the NER system typically consists of UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, the UvrD helicase, DNA polymerase I, and ligase. In addition, when DNA damage blocks transcription, transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF), the product of the mfd gene, recruits the Uvr complex to repair the damage. Previous work using selected mutants and assays have indicated that pathogenic Neisseria spp. carry a functional NER system. In order to comprehensively examine the role of NER in Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA recombination and repair processes, the predicted NER genes (uvrA, uvrB, uvrC, uvrD, and mfd) were each disrupted by a transposon insertion, and the uvrB and uvrD mutants were complemented with a copy of each gene in an ectopic locus. Each uvr mutant strain was highly sensitive to UV irradiation and also showed sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide killing, confirming that all of the NER genes in N. gonorrhoeae are functional. The effect of RecA expression on UV survival was minor in uvr mutants but much larger in the mfd mutant. All of the NER mutants demonstrated wild-type levels of pilin antigenic variation and DNA transformation. However, the uvrD mutant exhibited higher frequencies of PilC-mediated pilus phase variation and spontaneous mutation, a finding consistent with a role for UvrD in mismatch repair. We conclude that NER functions are conserved in N. gonorrhoeae and are important for the DNA repair capabilities of this strict human pathogen."

METHODS: In this family case report, we evaluated 9 members of the same family originating from Algeria. Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17. RESULTS: Five males related through a maternal lineage were affected, suggesting an X-linked inheritance. Four of them had symptomatic moyamoya syndrome with an onset of acute neurologic manifestations between 4 and 32 years. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, azoospermia, short stature of postnatal onset (-2 to -4 SD in adulthood), premature graying of hair, and dysmorphism were present in all patients. The other features of the disease included early cataract in 4, dilated cardiomyopathy in 3, and partial growth hormone deficiency in 2 members. Muscle biopsy data did not reveal signs of a mitochondrial disorder. All conditions known to be associated with moyamoya syndrome such as Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and sickle cell disease were excluded. We also excluded linkage to the 2 loci previously reported to be involved in autosomal dominant syndromic and nonsyndromic moyamoya. Carrier females had normal phenotype and clinical history.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess anthropometry, musculoskeletal alterations and the prevalence of physical therapy treatments among patients with MS. METHODS: Twenty-six patients were included in this study [17 females (age: 13.23\u00b12.77 years; body mass 51.5\u00b124-68 Kg; height 1.70\u00b11.40-1.81 m; arm span: 1.73\u00b10.12 m) and 9 males (age: 14.44\u00b12.18; body mass: 61.0\u00b142-72 Kg; height: 1.83\u00b11.66-1.97 m; arm span: 1.93\u00b10.13 m)]. Anthropometric measurements and musculoskeletal abnormalities were determined in a standardized fashion: pectus and scoliosis were assessed through radiography and angulation (\u00e2) of the scoliosis curve using the Cobb method; arachnodactyly was assessed through the thumb sign and Walker-Murdoch test and dolichostenomelia was assessed by arm span in relation to height. Patients also responded to a questionnaire addressing participation in physical therapy. RESULTS: In comparison to values estimated for the Brazilian population, mass and height were greater among the patients with MS (females: p=0.001 e p<0.0005 e males p=0.019 e p=0.0001, respectively). The following musculoskeletal abnormalities were found: pectus in 3 patients (11%), pectus and scoliosis in 19 (73%), dolichostenomelia in 11 (42%) and arachnodactyly in 21 (80%). Eleven patients (42%) with MS had previously undergone physical therapy.

Rational use of these tools, tailored for the individuals metabolic abnormalities, should allow for good glycemic control in the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Relaxation, massage, opium, and moderate exercise were among the recommended options for treatment of diabetes mellitus nearly 100 years ago. In the late nineteenth century, diabetes was a poorly characterized disorder, which was increasing in prevalence even at that time. Today, the underlying defects contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes are better understood, and include peripheral insulin resistance, relative pancreatic beta-cell insufficiency, increased hepatic glucose output, and an exaggerated postprandial glucose excursion. However, despite our better understanding of the disease, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase in the US, now afflicting over 6% of the population. As our population ages and the proportion of obese people increases, we can expect to see a marked increase in the prevalence of diabetes in the future. Fortunately, our treatment options for type 2 diabetes have expanded remarkably within the last few years. Along with these new treatment options comes the exciting, although likely expensive, possibility of prevention of type 2 diabetes in at risk individuals."

We aim to study the SCN5A gene in a cohort of Brugada syndrome (BS) patients and evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation. BS is caused by mutations in up to 10 different genes, SCN5A being the most frequently involved. Large genomic rearrangements in SCN5A have been associated with conduction disease, but its prevalence in BS is unknown. Seventy-six non-related patients with BS were studied. Clinical characteristics and family risk profile were recorded. Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively. Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X). Patients with mutations had a trend toward a higher proportion of spontaneous type I Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) (87.5% vs 52.9%, p = 0.06) and had evidence of familial disease (62.5%, vs 23.5%, p = 0.03). The symptoms and risk profile of the carriers were not different from wild-type probands. There were non-significant differences in the prevalence of type I ECG, syncope and history of arrhythmia in carriers of selected polymorphisms. None of the patients had any deletion/duplication in the SCN5A gene. In conclusion, 10.5% of our patients had mutations in the SCN5A gene. Patients with mutations seemed to have more spontaneous type I ECG, but no differences in syncope or arrhythmic events compared with patients without mutations. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the SCN5A in the expression of the phenotype and prognosis. Large rearrangements were not identified in the SCN5A gene using the MLPA technique."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical outcomes and steroid side effects in a cohort of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treated with long-term daily glucocorticoid therapy. Although daily glucocorticoid therapy has been shown to extend ambulatory function in DMD, less frequent dosing is often used because of side effect concerns. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 97 patients with DMD aged 10 to <16 years treated with daily glucocorticoid (89% on deflazacort) for a mean of 8.5 years. Outcome measures were motor, pulmonary, and cardiac function, and scoliosis. Side effects were growth failure and weight gain, facial fullness, blood pressure, bone health, cataracts, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavior, hypertrichosis, and need for medication interventions. RESULTS: For 13- to 16-year-old patients, 40% could rise from the floor and 50% could perform the 30-foot run test. Forced vital capacity for the entire cohort was well preserved. Thirteen percent of younger (10- to <13-year-old) and 21% of older patients had findings of left ventricle systolic dysfunction. Six percent (all aged 16 years) developed scoliosis (Cobb angle >20 degrees). Eighty-six percent had normal weight velocities; 30% had no increased facial fullness; 72% had short stature; and 19% had asymptomatic cataracts. Asymptomatic spine compression deformities were noted in 76% and long bone fractures in 30%. One patient stopped glucocorticoid because of behavioral concerns. CONCLUSIONS: With evidence for improved outcomes and manageable side effects, we recommend use of daily glucocorticoid therapy for patients with DMD with anticipatory management of side effects and a coordinated interdisciplinary care approach."

          "context": "A direct repeat of E-box-like elements is required for cell-autonomous circadian rhythm of clock genes. BACKGROUND: The circadian expression of the mammalian clock genes is based on transcriptional feedback loops. Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG). The non-canonical E-boxes or E-box-like sequences have also been reported to be necessary for circadian oscillation. RESULTS: We report a new cis-element required for cell-autonomous circadian transcription of clock genes. This new element consists of a canonical E-box or a non-canonical E-box and an E-box-like sequence in tandem with the latter with a short interval, 6 base pairs, between them. We demonstrate that both E-box or E-box-like sequences are needed to generate cell-autonomous oscillation. We also verify that the spacing nucleotides with constant length between these 2 E-elements are crucial for robust oscillation. Furthermore, by in silico analysis we conclude that several clock and clock-controlled genes possess a direct repeat of the E-box-like elements in their promoter region. CONCLUSION: We propose a novel possible mechanism regulated by double E-box-like elements, not to a single E-box, for circadian transcriptional oscillation. The direct repeat of the E-box-like elements identified in this study is the minimal required element for the generation of cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of clock and clock-controlled genes."

Given the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation, the need for safe and effective stroke prophylaxis will continue to rise. Warfarin has been around for many years and has proven efficacy in preventing stroke, but it has major limitations due to its variable dosing, food and drug interactions, and requirement for regular monitoring. Newer agents which include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have recently or will soon be available and may provide an improved efficacy in stroke prevention, an improved safety profile, and improved user-friendliness. Dabigatran was the first of the agents to be widely available, and in the RE-LY study, dabigatran (150 mg dose) showed superiority to warfarin in preventing ischemic stroke and a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding. Rivaroxaban was studied in the ROCKETAF trial, and with once daily dosing, it showed noninferiority to warfarin in preventing stroke with a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding. The ARISTOTLE trial showed apixaban was superior to warfarin for stroke prevention, significantly reduced all major bleeding, and resulted in a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. While all three trials have important limitations, they were very large randomized trials with more than 14,000 patients each and show a clear overall net clinical benefit when compared with warfarin. Key features of the drugs as well as an individual's preferences and stability on warfarin will help guide the ultimate drug choice for any given patient, but these newer anticoagulant agents are likely to usher in a new era in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation."

Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. Although further studies are required to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns, these associations suggest that genetic adaptation to high altitude involves alteration in energy utilization pathways."

We identify a new mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes. Human breast and colorectal cancer cells release exosomes containing full-length, signaling-competent EGFR ligands. Exosomes isolated from MDCK cells expressing individual full-length EGFR ligands displayed differential activities; AREG exosomes increased invasiveness of recipient breast cancer cells 4-fold over TGF\u03b1 or HB-EGF exosomes and 5-fold over equivalent amounts of recombinant AREG. Exosomal AREG displayed significantly greater membrane stability than TGF\u03b1 or HB-EGF. An average of 24\u00a0AREG molecules are packaged within an individual exosome, and AREG exosomes are rapidly internalized by recipient cells. Whether the composition and behavior of exosomes differ between nontransformed and transformed cells is unknown. Exosomes from DLD-1\u00a0colon cancer cells with a mutant KRAS allele exhibited both higher AREG levels and greater invasive potential than exosomes from isogenically matched, nontransformed cells in which mutant KRAS was eliminated by homologous recombination. We speculate that EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes might contribute to diverse cancer phenomena such as field effect and priming of the metastatic niche."

Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5). A preceding screening transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with an aortic diameter of 3.2 cm; at the time of moyamoya diagnosis, the aorta was 3.5 cm with mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation.

In its classic form, it is characterized by mucocutaneous abnormalities, BM failure, and a predisposition to cancer. BM failure is the principal cause of premature mortality. Studies over the last 15 years have led to significant advances, with 8 DC genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TIN2, C16orf57, and TCAB1) having been characterized. Seven of these are important in telomere maintenance either because they encode components of the telomerase enzyme complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, and TCAB1) or the shelterin complex (TINF2). DC is therefore principally a disease of defective telomere maintenance and patients usually have very short telomeres. The genetic advances have led to the unification of DC with several other disorders, including the severe multisystem disorders Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson and Revesz syndromes, as well as a subset of patients with aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This wide spectrum of diseases ranging from classic DC to aplastic anemia can be regarded as disorders of defective telomere maintenance-\"the telomereopathies.\" These advances have increased our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and highlighted the important role of telomerase and telomeres in human biology. They are also facilitating the diagnosis (especially when presentation is atypical) and management of DC."

Transfection of HEK293 cells with Chk2 wildtype and Chk2 mutants in the absence or presence of DNA damage showed significant T68 phosphorylation already in the absence of DNA damaging reagents. Upon DNA damage, phosphorylation of additional Chk2 sites was observed (S19, S33/35). A comparison of ATM+/+ and ATM-/- cells with respect to phosphorylation of residues T68, S19, S33/35 in the absence and presence of DNA damage showed in all cases phosphorylation of T68, although signal intensity was increased ca. three-fold after DNA damage.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common health problems for children and adolescents. If not successfully treated, it can impact patients and families with significant disability due to loss of school, work, and social function. When headaches become frequent, it is essential to try to prevent the headaches. For children and adolescents, this is guided by extrapolation from adult studies, a limited number of small studies in children and adolescents and practitioner preference. The aim of the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) study is to determine the most effective preventive agent to use in children and adolescents. METHODS: CHAMP is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, comparative effectiveness study of amitriptyline and topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, designed to mirror real-world practice, sponsored by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institutes of Health (U01NS076788). The study will recruit 675 subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years old, inclusive, who have migraine with or without aura or chronic migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, with at least 4 headaches in the 28 days prior to randomization. The subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 (amitriptyline: topiramate: placebo) ratio. Doses are weight based and will be slowly titrated over an 8-week period to a target dose of 1 mg/kg of amitriptyline and 2 mg/kg of topiramate. The primary outcome will be a 50% reduction in headache frequency between the 28-day baseline and the final 28 days of treatment (weeks 20-24). CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the CHAMP study is to obtain level 1 evidence for the effectiveness of amitriptyline and topiramate in the prevention of migraine in children and adolescents. If this study proves to be positive, it will provide information to the practicing physician as how to best prevent migraine in children and adolescents and subsequently improve the disability and outcomes."

          "context": "Identification of tumour-specific epigenetic events in medulloblastoma development by hypermethylation profiling. Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation."

Hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on the surface ECG and a high risk for arrhythmia-related sudden death. Mutations in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1, account for the most common form of LQTS, LQTS1. The objective of this study was the characterization of a novel KCNQ1 mutation linked to LQTS. Electrophysiological properties and clinical features were determined and compared to characteristics of a different mutation at the same position. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing was performed to screen LQTS genes for mutations. A novel missense mutation in the KCNQ1 gene, KCNQ1 P320H, was identified in the index patient presenting with recurrent syncope and aborted sudden death triggered by physical stress and swimming. Electrophysiological analyses of KCNQ1 P320H and the previously reported KCNQ1 P320A mutation indicate that both channels are non-functional and suppress wild type I(Ks) in a dominant-negative fashion. Based on homology modeling of the KCNQ1 channel pore region, we speculate that the proline residue at position 320 limits flexibility of the outer pore and is required to maintain the functional architecture of the selectivity filter/pore helix arrangement. Our observations on the KCNQ1 P320H mutation are consistent with previous studies indicating that pore mutations in potassium channel alpha-subunits are associated with more severe electrophysiological and clinical phenotypes than mutations in other regions of these proteins. This study emphasizes the significance of mutation screening for diagnosis, risk-assessment, and mutation-site specific management in LQTS patients."

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the structure and function of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a group of patients with autism who had gastrointestinal symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six children (age: 5.7 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures. The most frequent gastrointestinal complaints were chronic diarrhea, gaseousness, and abdominal discomfort and distension. RESULTS: Histologic examination in these 36 children revealed grade I or II reflux esophagitis in 25 (69.4%), chronic gastritis in 15, and chronic duodenitis in 24. The number of Paneth's cells in the duodenal crypts was significantly elevated in autistic children compared with non-autistic control subjects. Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58.3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function. Seventy-five percent of the autistic children (27/36) had an increased pancreatico-biliary fluid output after intravenous secretin administration. Nineteen of the 21 patients with diarrhea had significantly higher fluid output than those without diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients. The observed increase in pancreatico-biliary secretion after secretin infusion suggests an upregulation of secretin receptors in the pancreas and liver. Further studies are required to determine the possible association between the brain and gastrointestinal dysfunctions in children with autistic disorder."

Here we report that the MTREC complex, which has recently been shown to promote degradation of meiotic mRNAs and regulatory ncRNAs, is also the major nuclear exosome targeting complex for CUTs and unspliced pre-mRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The MTREC complex specifically binds to CUTs, meiotic mRNAs and unspliced pre-mRNA transcripts and targets these RNAs for degradation by the nuclear exosome, while the TRAMP complex has only a minor role in this process. The MTREC complex physically interacts with the nuclear exosome and with various RNA-binding and RNA-processing complexes, coupling RNA processing to the RNA degradation machinery.

RATIONALE: Most cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mutations associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) are postulated to cause a distinctive form of Ca(2+) release dysfunction. Considering the spread distribution of CPVT mutations, we hypothesized that dysfunctional heterogeneity also was feasible. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with CPVT in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent arrhythmias in whole hearts and intact mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Recombinant channels harboring CPVT-linked RyR2 mutations were functionally characterized using tritiated ryanodine binding and single-channel recordings. Homologous recombination was used to generate a knock-in mouse bearing the RyR2-V2475F mutation. Ventricular myocytes from mice heterozygous for the mutation (RyR2-V2475F(+/-)) and their wild-type littermates were Ca(2+)-imaged by confocal microscopy under conditions that mimic stress. The propensity of wild-type and RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice to have development of arrhythmias was tested at the whole heart level and in intact animals. Recombinant RyR2-V2475F channels displayed increased cytosolic Ca(2+) activation, abnormal protein kinase A phosphorylation, and increased activation by luminal Ca(2+). The RyR2-V2475F mutation appears embryonic-lethal in homozygous mice, but heterozygous mice have no alterations at baseline. Spontaneous Ca(2+) release events were more frequent and had shorter latency in isoproterenol-stimulated cardiomyocytes from RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts, but their threshold was unchanged with respect to wild-type. Adrenergically triggered tachyarrhythmias were more frequent in RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other CPVT mutations and produces heterogeneous mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction. In living mice, this mutation appears too severe to be harbored in all RyR2 channels but remains undetected under basal conditions if expressed at relatively low levels. \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation breaks the delicate Ca(2+) equilibrium of RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts and triggers life-threatening arrhythmias."

In zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription. Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression."

In Arabidopsis a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling factor-related protein DDM1 and a cytosine methyltransferase MET1 are required for maintenance of genomic cytosine methylation.

In this work we have assessed the effects of these mutations on the PAI tryptophan biosynthetic gene family, which consists of four densely methylated genes arranged as a tail-to-tail inverted repeat plus two unlinked singlet genes. The methylation mutations caused only partial demethylation of the PAI loci: ddm1 had a strong effect on the singlet genes but a weaker effect on the inverted repeat, whereas met1 had a stronger effect on the inverted repeat than on the singlet genes. The double ddm1 met1 mutant also displayed partial demethylation of the PAI genes, with a pattern similar to the ddm1 single mutant. To determine the relationship between partial methylation and expression for the singlet PAI2 gene we constructed a novel reporter strain of Arabidopsis in which PAI2 silencing could be monitored by a blue fluorescent plant phenotype diagnostic of tryptophan pathway defects. This reporter strain revealed that intermediate levels of methylation correlate with intermediate suppression of the fluorescent phenotype."

          "context": "Mechanism of chromosomal DNA replication initiation and replication fork stabilization in eukaryotes. Chromosomal DNA replication is one of the central biological events occurring inside cells. Due to its large size, the replication of genomic DNA in eukaryotes initiates at hundreds to tens of thousands of sites called DNA origins so that the replication could be completed in a limited time. Further, eukaryotic DNA replication is sophisticatedly regulated, and this regulation guarantees that each origin fires once per S phase and each segment of DNA gets duplication also once per cell cycle. The first step of replication initiation is the assembly of pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Since 1973, four proteins, Cdc6/Cdc18, MCM, ORC and Cdt1, have been extensively studied and proved to be pre-RC components. Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was identified. Sap1/Girdin is required for loading Cdc18/Cdc6 to origins for pre-RC assembly in the fission yeast and human cells, respectively. At the transition of G1 to S phase, pre-RC is activated by the two kinases, cyclindependent kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), and subsequently, RPA, primase-pol\u03b1, PCNA, topoisomerase, Cdc45, pol\u03b4, and pol\u025b are recruited to DNA origins for creating two bi-directional replication forks and initiating DNA replication. As replication forks move along chromatin DNA, they frequently stall due to the presence of a great number of replication barriers on chromatin DNA, such as secondary DNA structures, protein/DNA complexes, DNA lesions, gene transcription. Stalled forks must require checkpoint regulation for their stabilization. Otherwise, stalled forks will collapse, which results in incomplete DNA replication and genomic instability. This short review gives a concise introduction regarding the current understanding of replication initiation and replication fork stabilization."

BACKGROUND: Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is an inherited skin disorder caused by mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) and keratin 14 (KRT14) genes, with fragility of basal keratinocytes leading to epidermal cytolysis and blistering. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we characterized mutations in KRT5 and KRT14 genes in patients with EBS and investigated their possible structure-function correlations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutations were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Further, to explore possible correlations with function, the structural effects of the mutations in segment 2B of KRT5 and KRT14 and associated with EBS in our patients, as well as those reported previously, were modelled by molecular dynamics with the aid of the known crystal structure of the analogous segment of human vimentin. RESULTS: We have identified mutations in the KRT5 and KRT14 genes in 16 of 23 families affected by EBS in the Czech Republic. Eleven different sequence variants were found, of which four have not been reported previously. Novel mutations were found in two patients with the EBS-Dowling-Meara variant (EBS-DM) [KRT14-p.Ser128Pro and KRT14-p.Gln374_Leu387dup(14)] and in three patients with localized EBS (KRT14-p.Leu136Pro and KRT5-p.Val143Ala). Molecular dynamics studies show that the mutations p.Glu411del and p.Ile467Thr perturb the secondary alpha-helical structure of the mutated polypeptide chain, the deletion p.Glu411del in KRT14 has a strong but only local influence on the secondary structure of KRT14, and the structural impact of the mutation p.Ile467Thr in KRT5 is spread along the helix to the C-terminus. In all the other point mutations studied, the direct structural impact was significantly weaker and did not destroy the alpha-helical pattern of the secondary protein structure. The changes of 3-D structure of the KRT5/KRT14 dimer induced by the steric structural impact of the single point mutations, and the resulting altered inter- and intramolecular contacts, are spread along the protein helices to the protein C-terminus, but the overall alpha-helical character of the secondary structure is not destroyed and the atomic displacements induced by mutations cause only limited-scale changes of the quaternary structure of the dimer. CONCLUSIONS: The results of molecular modelling show relationships between patients' phenotypes and the structural effects of individual mutations."

PURPOSE: In this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study, intetumumab (CNTO 95), a fully human anti-\u03b1v integrin monoclonal antibody was evaluated for safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic activity in patients with melanoma or angiosarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically-confirmed inoperable melanoma or angiosarcoma refractory to standard treatment were allocated to treatment with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg intetumumab, administered once every 3 weeks for up to four cycles unless unacceptable toxicity or disease progression occurred. Extended dosing was available for patients who responded with stable disease or better. RESULTS: Eight patients received 10 mg/kg and 11 received 20 mg/kg intetumumab. Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between treatment groups; 18 patients had metastatic malignant melanoma and one had angiosarcoma. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Headache was the most common adverse event across both dose groups. Vomiting, nausea and chills were more common, and uveitic reactions lasted longer, in patients treated with 20 mg/kg compared with 10 mg/kg intetumumab. No patient developed antibodies to intetumumab. Intetumumab drug exposure as assessed by area under the curve and maximum serum concentration appeared to increase approximately dose-proportionally from 10 to 20 mg/kg, while volume of distribution remained constant for both doses. Stable disease was observed in two patients with metastatic malignant melanoma (one in each dose group) for at least 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with metastatic malignant melanoma and angiosarcoma in this study, intetumumab demonstrated manageable toxicity, was well tolerated, and presented approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses."

BACKGROUND: Gut-selective blockade of lymphocyte trafficking by vedolizumab may constitute effective treatment for ulcerative colitis. METHODS: We conducted two integrated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of vedolizumab in patients with active disease. In the trial of induction therapy, 374 patients (cohort 1) received vedolizumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo intravenously at weeks 0 and 2, and 521 patients (cohort 2) received open-label vedolizumab at weeks 0 and 2, with disease evaluation at week 6. In the trial of maintenance therapy, patients in either cohort who had a response to vedolizumab at week 6 were randomly assigned to continue receiving vedolizumab every 8 or 4 weeks or to switch to placebo for up to 52 weeks. A response was defined as a reduction in the Mayo Clinic score (range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more active disease) of at least 3 points and a decrease of at least 30% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. RESULTS: Response rates at week 6 were 47.1% and 25.5% among patients in the vedolizumab group and placebo group, respectively (difference with adjustment for stratification factors, 21.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.6 to 31.7; P<0.001). At week 52, 41.8% of patients who continued to receive vedolizumab every 8 weeks and 44.8% of patients who continued to receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks were in clinical remission (Mayo Clinic score < 2 and no subscore >1), as compared with 15.9% of patients who switched to placebo (adjusted difference, 26.1 percentage points for vedolizumab every 8 weeks vs. placebo [95% CI, 14.9 to 37.2; P<0.001] and 29.1 percentage points for vedolizumab every 4 weeks vs. placebo [95% CI, 17.9 to 40.4; P<0.001]). The frequency of adverse events was similar in the vedolizumab and placebo groups.

BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) is an inflammatory disorder caused by mutations in any of six genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR). The disease is severe and effective treatments are urgently needed. We investigated the status of interferon-related biomarkers in patients with AGS with a view to future use in diagnosis and clinical trials. METHODS: In this case-control study, samples were collected prospectively from patients with mutation-proven AGS. The expression of six interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by quantitative PCR, and the median fold change, when compared with the median of healthy controls, was used to create an interferon score for each patient. Scores higher than the mean of controls plus two SD (>2\u00b7466) were designated as positive. Additionally, we collated historical data for interferon activity, measured with a viral cytopathic assay, in CSF and serum from mutation-positive patients with AGS. We also undertook neutralisation assays of interferon activity in serum, and looked for the presence of autoantibodies against a panel of interferon proteins. FINDINGS: 74 (90%) of 82 patients had a positive interferon score (median 12\u00b790, IQR 6\u00b714-20\u00b741) compared with two (7%) of 29 controls (median 0\u00b793, IQR 0\u00b757-1\u00b730). Of the eight patients with a negative interferon score, seven had mutations in RNASEH2B (seven [27%] of all 26 patients with mutations in this gene). Repeat sampling in 16 patients was consistent for the presence or absence of an interferon signature on 39 of 41 occasions. Interferon activity (tested in 147 patients) was negatively correlated with age (CSF, r=-0\u00b7604; serum, r=-0\u00b7289), and was higher in CSF than in serum in 104 of 136 paired samples. Neutralisation assays suggested that measurable antiviral activity was related to interferon \u03b1 production. We did not record significantly increased concentrations of autoantibodies to interferon subtypes in patients with AGS, or an association between the presence of autoantibodies and interferon score or serum interferon activity. INTERPRETATION: AGS is consistently associated with an interferon signature, which is apparently sustained over time and can thus be used to differentiate patients with AGS from controls. If future studies show that interferon status is a reactive biomarker, the measurement of an interferon score might prove useful in the assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are defined by behavioral deficits in social interaction and communication, repetitive stereotyped behaviors, and restricted interests/cognitive rigidity. Recent studies in humans and animal-models suggest that dysfunction of the cholinergic system may underlie autism-related behavioral symptoms. Here we tested the hypothesis that augmentation of acetylcholine (ACh) in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase may ameliorate autistic phenotypes. We first administered the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) Donepezil systemically by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. Second, the drug was injected directly into the rodent homolog of the caudate nucleus, the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), of the inbred mouse strain BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR), a commonly-used model presenting all core autism-related phenotypes and expressing low brain ACh levels. We found that i.p. injection of AChEI to BTBR mice significantly relieved autism-relevant phenotypes, including decreasing cognitive rigidity, improving social preference, and enhancing social interaction, in a dose-dependent manner. Microinjection of the drug directly into the DMS, but not into the ventromedial striatum, led to significant amelioration of the cognitive-rigidity and social-deficiency phenotypes. Taken together, these findings provide evidence of the key role of the cholinergic system and the DMS in the etiology of ASD, and suggest that elevated cognitive flexibility may result in enhanced social attention. The potential therapeutic effect of AChEIs in ASD patients is discussed."

Analysis by molecular hybridization of the RNAs transcribed by a cell-free fraction from avocado infected with avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBV) demonstrated the presence of newly synthesized viroid-specific sequences, most of which were of the same polarity as the mature infectious viroid RNA. Treatment of the cell-free fraction with DNase reduced the total synthesis of RNA considerably, but it did not influence that of the ASBV-specific RNAs, indicating that the latter were transcribed on an RNA template. Inhibition studies with alpha-amanitin showed that the synthesis of ASBV-specific RNAs was not affected by concentrations of 1 and 200 micrograms/ml of the drug, which typically inhibit RNA polymerase II and III, respectively, from most animal and plant systems. These results suggest that either RNA polymerase I or an unidentified RNA polymerase activity resistant to alpha-amanitin, acting on an RNA template, plays a role in the replication of ASBV, whereas for the rest of the viroids studied so far it appears that RNA polymerase II is involved. Analysis by polycrylamide gel electrophoresis under partially and fully denaturing conditions of the ASBV-specific RNAs synthesized in vitro showed that they contain unit and longer than unit length viroid strands, probably associated in complexes with single- and double-stranded regions. The structural properties of these complexes are similar to those of the RNAs accumulating in vivo in viroid-infected tissues, which are the postulated replicative intermediates of the rolling-circle mechanism proposed for viroid synthesis."

The currently available experimental data supports the hypothesis that the neuroprotective effect of dimebon is related to the protection of the brain-mitochondria from neurodegeneration. In this study, the influence of dimebon on mitochondria was investigated to gain a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of this drug. Here, we demonstrate that dimebon enhances the resistance of the isolated rat brain and liver mitochondria to the induction of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) by calcium ions even in the presence of atractyloside, a MPT pore (MPTP) opener, but is ineffective against atractyloside-induced mitochondria swelling. Unlike cyclosporine A (CsA), a MPTP inhibitor, Dimebon does not influence the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) conformational changes and is not able to prevent the MPT of de-energized mitochondria. Using three different assays, and using amyloid-\u03b2 peptide for inducing mitochondrial toxicity, we show that the influence of dimebon on the calcium retention capacity (CRC) of mitochondria depends on the mode of calcium addition. No obvious influence of dimebon on CRC was observed under the conditions of calcium infusion in the pump mode but the increase of CRC of rat brain mitochondria was observed when calcium was added in the bolus mode; the addition of calcium in the single pulse mode led to the increase of the lag period of calcium efflux from mitochondria. From these studies it is shown that dimebon is effective against amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) potentiated mitochondrial swelling and decrease of calcium retention capacity (CRC) of the brain mitochondria."

It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins. Fused genes have been identified as non-transitive patterns of similarity in triplets of genes. To be computationally tractable, this approach usually imposes an a priori distinction between a dataset in which fused genes are searched for, and a dataset that may have provided genetic material for fusion. This reduces the 'genetic space' in which fusion can be discovered, as only a subset of triplets of genes is investigated. Moreover, this approach may have a high-false-positive rate, and it does not identify gene families descending from a common fusion event. RESULTS: We represent similarities between sequences as a network. This leads to an efficient formulation of previous methods of fused gene identification, which we implemented in the Python program FusedTriplets. Furthermore, we propose a new characterization of families of fused genes, as clique minimal separators of the sequence similarity network. This well-studied graph topology provides a robust and fast method of detection, well suited for automatic analyses of big datasets. We implemented this method in the C++ program MosaicFinder, which additionally uses local alignments to discard false-positive candidates and indicates potential fusion points. The grouping into families will help distinguish sequencing or prediction errors from real biological fusions, and it will yield additional insight into the function and history of fused genes.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is a major risk factor for stroke. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. In the pivotal phase III trial ROCKET AF, rivaroxaban demonstrated non-inferiority compared with warfarin for reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) in patients with AF (intention-to-treat analysis), without an increased risk of major bleeding. Superior efficacy vs. warfarin was achieved while patients were on study medication. Other direct oral factor Xa inhibitors have completed phase III clinical trials in this indication. Compared with warfarin, apixaban (in the ARISTOTLE trial) and edoxaban (in the ENGAGE-AF trial) were shown to be superior or non-inferior, respectively, for reduction in stroke or SE risk in patients with AF. Baseline stroke risk, as indicated by CHADS2 scores, was lower in patients in the ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE-AF trials than in ROCKET AF. OBJECTIVES: This review discusses the main findings from ROCKET AF, specifically examining recent subgroup analyses investigating rivaroxaban use across various patient types at high risk for adverse outcomes, including those with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack, reduced renal function, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, heart failure or patients aged > \u00a075\u00a0years and those resident in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: These subgroup analyses demonstrate that the treatment effect for rivaroxaban vs. warfarin is broadly consistent across a wide range of patient groups, with respect to both efficacy and safety."

We carried out a comparative kinetic analysis of two prototypes of these transporter families. The first was Fcy21p, a herein characterized protein of Candida albicans, and the second was AzgA, a transporter of Aspergillus nidulans. Our results showed that: (i) AzgA and Fcy21p are equally efficient high-affinity, high-capacity, purine transporters, (ii) Fcy21p, but not AzgA, is an efficient cytosine and 5-fluorocytosine transporter, interacting with =O2 and C4-NH2 of the pyrimidine ring, (iii) the major interactions of AzgA and Fcy21p with the purine ring are similar, but not identical, involving in all cases positions 6 and 7, and for some substrates, positions 1 and 9 as well, and (iv) in AzgA, bulky groups at position N3 have a detrimental steric effect on substrate binding, while similar substitutions at C2 or N9 are fully or partially tolerated. In contrast, in Fcy21p, C2 and N9 bulky substitutions abolish substrate binding, while similar substitutions in N3 are fully tolerated. These results suggest that all fungal purine transporters might have evolved from a single ancestral protein, and show that fungal transporters use different substrate interactions compared to the analogous protozoan or mammalian proteins. Finally, results are also discussed in respect of the possibility of using fungal purine transporters as specific gateways for the development of targeted antifungal pharmacological therapies."

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to analyze the costs and consequences of treatment with pembrolizumab compared to treatment with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma not previously treated with ipilimumab. The model was parameterized by using data from a head-to-head phase III randomized clinical trial, KEYNOTE-006. Extrapolation of long-term outcomes was based on approaches previously applied, combining ipilimumab data and melanoma patients' registry data. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service, and a lifetime horizon (40 years) was used. Portugal-specific disease management costs were estimated by convening a panel of six clinical experts to derive health state resource use and multiplying the results by national unit costs. To test for the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Pembrolizumab increases life expectancy in 1.57 undiscounted life-years (LYs) and is associated with an increase in costs versus that of ipilimumab. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is \u20ac47,221 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and \u20ac42,956 per LY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the change of most input values or assumptions and were sensitive to time on treatment scenarios. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed, pembrolizumab is associated with a cost per QALY gained inferior to \u20ac50,000 in 75% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the usually accepted thresholds in oncology, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective alternative for treating patients with advanced melanoma in Portugal."

One hundred and thirty-six women were randomly allocated, to one of three treatment regimens: DTX 100 plus FEC 75, alternated for eight courses (ALT); four courses of DTX 100 followed by four courses of FEC 75 (SEQ T); or four courses of FEC 75 followed by four courses of DTX 100 (SEQ F). One hundred and thirty-one women were evaluable for tumour response. Although the treatment outcome was equivalent in the two sequential arms and the alternating regimen (P=0.110, not significant), the response rate was less encouraging in the SEQ F arm (52.3%) than in the other two arms (71.1% for ALT and 70.5% for SEQ T), in which docetaxel was administered first. Time to progression was similar in the ALT, SEQ T and SEQ F arms (9.5, 9.3 and 10.4 months respectively). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was observed in nearly all patients; febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% (ALT), 16% (SEQ T) and 2% (SEQ F) of patients. Few patients (< or =9%) developed grade 3-4 non-haematological toxicities. Relative dose intensity was 97-99% for all regimens. All treatment regimens were active and well tolerated."

The mammalian circadian oscillator is composed of interacting positive and negative transcription events. The clock proteins PER1 and PER2 play essential roles in a negative limb of the feedback loop that generates the circadian rhythm in mammals. In addition, the proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL) form a heterodimer that drives the Per genes via the E-box consensus sequences within their promoter regions. In the present study, we demonstrate that Id2 is involved in stabilization of the amplitudes of the circadian oscillations by suppressing transcriptional activation of clock genes Clock and Bmal1. Id2 shows dynamic oscillation in the SCN, with a peak in the late subjective night. Under constant dark conditions (DD), Id2(-/-) mice showed no apparent difference in locomotor activity, however, under constant light conditions (LL), Id2(-/-) mice exhibit aberrant locomotor activity, with lower circadian oscillation amplitudes, although the free running periods in Id2(-/-) mice show no differences from those in either wild type or heterozygous mice. Id2(-/-) animals also exhibit upregulation of Per1 in constant light, during both the subjective night and day. In wild type mice, Id2 is upregulated by constant light exposure during the subjective night. We propose that Id2 expression in the SCN contributes to maintenance of dynamic circadian oscillations."

To understand how cells differentially use the dozens of myosin isozymes present in each genome, we examined the distribution of four unconventional myosin isozymes in the inner ear, a tissue that is particularly reliant on actin-rich structures and unconventional myosin isozymes. Of the four isozymes, each from a different class, three are expressed in the hair cells of amphibia and mammals. In stereocilia, constructed of cross-linked F-actin filaments, myosin-Ibeta is found mostly near stereociliary tips, myosin-VI is largely absent, and myosin-VIIa colocalizes with crosslinks that connect adjacent stereocilia. In the cuticular plate, a meshwork of actin filaments, myosin-Ibeta is excluded, myosin-VI is concentrated, and modest amounts of myosin-VIIa are present. These three myosin isozymes are excluded from other actin-rich domains, including the circumferential actin belt and the cortical actin network. A member of a fourth class, myosin-V, is not expressed in hair cells but is present at high levels in afferent nerve cells that innervate hair cells. Substantial amounts of myosins-Ibeta, -VI, and -VIIa are located in a pericuticular necklace that is largely free of F-actin, squeezed between (but not associated with) actin of the cuticular plate and the circumferential belt. Our localization results suggest specific functions for three hair-cell myosin isozymes. As suggested previously, myosin-Ibeta probably plays a role in adaptation; concentration of myosin-VI in cuticular plates and association with stereociliary rootlets suggest that this isozyme participates in rigidly anchoring stereocilia; and finally, colocalization with cross-links between adjacent stereocilia indicates that myosin-VIIa is required for the structural integrity of hair bundles."

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA (miRNA) are recognized as important regulators of a variety of fundamental biologic processes. Previously, we described increased expression of miR-155 and miR-146a in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and showed a repressive effect of miR-155 on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). The present study was undertaken to examine alterations in expression of miR-203 in RASFs and analyze its role in fibroblast activation. METHODS: Differentially expressed miRNA in RASFs versus osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening of 260 individual miRNA. Transfection of miR-203 precursor was used to analyze the function of miR-203 in RASFs. Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and MMPs were measured by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RASFs were stimulated with IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and 5-azacytidine (5-azaC). Activity of I\u03baB kinase 2 was inhibited with SC-514. RESULTS: Expression of miR-203 was higher in RASFs than in OASFs or fibroblasts from healthy donors. Levels of miR-203 did not change upon stimulation with IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, or LPS; however, DNA demethylation with 5-azaC increased the expression of miR-203. Enforced expression of miR-203 led to significantly increased levels of MMP-1 and IL-6. Induction of IL-6 by miR-203 overexpression was inhibited by blocking of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Basal expression levels of IL-6 correlated with basal expression levels of miR-203. CONCLUSION: The current results demonstrate methylation-dependent regulation of miR-203 expression in RASFs. Importantly, they also show that elevated levels of miR-203 lead to increased secretion of MMP-1 and IL-6 via the NF-\u03baB pathway and thereby contribute to the activated phenotype of synovial fibroblasts in RA."

We investigated structural and functional aspects of the first mutation in TNNC1, coding for the calcium-binding subunit (cTnC) of cardiac troponin, which was detected in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [ Hoffmann B, Schmidt-Traub H, Perrot A, Osterziel KJ & Gessner R (2001) Hum Mut17, 524]. This mutation leads to a leucine-glutamine exchange at position 29 in the nonfunctional calcium-binding site of cTnC. Interestingly, the mutation is located in a putative interaction site for the nonphosphorylated N-terminal arm of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) [ Finley NL, Abbott MB, Abusamhadneh E, Gaponenko V, Dong W, Seabrook G, Howarth JW, Rana M, Solaro RJ, Cheung HC et al. (1999) EJB Lett453, 107-112]. According to peptide array experiments, the nonphosphorylated cTnI arm interacts with cTnC around L29. This interaction is almost abolished by L29Q, as observed upon protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI at serine 22 and serine 23 in wild-type troponin. With CD spectroscopy, minor changes are observed in the backbone of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated cTnC upon the L29Q replacement. A small, but significant, reduction in calcium sensitivity was detected upon measuring the Ca2+-dependent actomyosin subfragment 1 (actoS1)-ATPase activity and the sliding velocity of thin filaments. The maximum actoS1-ATPase activity, but not the maximum sliding velocity, was significantly enhanced. In addition, we performed our investigations at different levels of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI. The in vitro assays mainly showed that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the actoS1-ATPase activity, and the mean sliding velocity of thin filaments, were no longer affected by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI owing to the L29Q exchange in cTnC. The findings imply a hindered transduction of the phosphorylation signal from cTnI to cTnC."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the recruitment of leukocytes and the accumulation of inflammatory mediators within the synovial compartment. Release of the chemokine CCL18 has been widely attributed to antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. This study investigates the production of CCL18 in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), the predominant cell type recruited into synovial fluid (SF). Microarray analysis, semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified SF PMN from patients with RA as a novel source for CCL18 in diseased joints. Highly upregulated expression of other chemokine genes was observed for CCL3, CXCL8 and CXCL10, whereas CCL21 was downregulated. The chemokine receptor genes were differentially expressed, with upregulation of CXCR4, CCRL2 and CCR5 and downregulation of CXCR1 and CXCR2. In cell culture experiments, expression of CCL18 mRNA in blood PMN was induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas synthesis of CCL18 protein required additional stimulation with a combination of IL-10 and vitamin D3. In comparison, recruited SF PMN from patients with RA were sensitized for CCL18 production, because IL-10 alone was sufficient to induce CCL18 release. These results suggest a release of the T cell-attracting CCL18 by PMN when recruited to diseased joints. However, its production is tightly regulated at the levels of mRNA expression and protein synthesis."

CONTEXT: Pheochromocytoma is a rare disease but with high mortality if it is not being diagnosed early. Several biochemical tests with high accuracy have been obtained, but the clinical threshold for request of these tests is not determined clearly. OBJECTIVES: To determine the Likelihood Ratios of clinical symptoms and signs in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. And also meta-analysis of their sensitivity in this disease. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1960 to February 2014. Bibliographies were searched to find additional articles. STUDY SELECTION: We included original studies describing the sensitivity and/or likelihood ratios of signs and symptoms in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Their method of diagnosis should have been based on pathology. We excluded specific subtypes or syndromes related to pheochromocytoma, or specific ages or gender. Also we excluded studies before 1993 (JNC5) which no definition of hypertension was presented. 37 articles were chosen finally. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors reviewed data from articles independently and gave discrepancies to third author for decision. The aim was extraction of raw numbers of patients having defined signs or symptoms, and draw 2 \u00d7 2 tables if data available. We meta-analyzed sensitivities by Statsdirect and Likelihood Ratios by Meta-disc soft wares. Because our data was heterogeneous based on I(2) > 50\u00a0% (except negative Likelihood ratio of hypertension), we used random effect model for doing meta-analysis. We checked publication bias by drawing Funnel plot for each sign/symptom, and also Egger test. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most prevalent signs and symptoms reported were hypertension (pooled sensitivity of 80.7\u00a0%), headache (pooled sensitivity of 60.4\u00a0%), palpitation (pooled sensitivity of 59.3\u00a0%) and diaphoresis (pooled sensitivity of 52.4\u00a0%). The definition of orthostatic hypotension was different among studies. The sensitivity was 23-50\u00a0%. Paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias based on Funnel plot and Egger test (P value < 0.05). Seven of the articles had control group, and could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Diaphoresis (LR+ 2.2, LR- 0.45), Palpitation (LR+ 1.9, LR- 0.52) and headache (LR+ 1.6, LR- 0.24) were significant symptoms in clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Other signs and symptoms had been reported in only one study and could not have been meta-analyzed. Classic triad of headache, palpitation and diaphoresis in hypertensive patients had the LR+ 6.312 (95\u00a0% CI 0.217-183.217) and LR- 0.139 (95\u00a0% CI 0.059-0.331). Surprisingly, hypertension was not important in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma, and even normotension increased the probability of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, to specify the value of clinical findings. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging."

The c-ret protooncogene, RET, encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin. The ligands bind RET through GDNF family receptor alpha, termed GFRalpha1-4. Despite the importance of RET signaling in the development of the enteric nervous system and the kidney, the differential signaling mechanisms between RET ligands are poorly established. It has been suggested that signal specificity is achieved through binding of the ligand to its preferred GFRalpha. To compare the signaling profiles of GDNF and neurturin, we have identified a cell line, NG108-15, which endogenously expresses RET and GFRalpha1 but not GFRalpha2-4. Immunoblot data showed that GDNF caused a transient activation, whereas neurturin caused a sustained activation, of both p44/p42 MAP kinases and PLCgamma. Under serum starvation, NG108-15 cells differentiate and form neurites. Neurturin but not GDNF stimulated neurite outgrowth, which could be blocked by the selective PLC inhibitor U73122. On the other hand, GDNF but not neurturin promoted cell survival, and this could be blocked by the p44/p42 MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. Our findings not only show the differential signaling of GDNF and neurturin but also suggest that this can be achieved through binding to the same GFRalpha subtype, leading to distinct biological responses."

The best 3D-QSAR model was selected on the basis of the highest value of Q(2)test (0.600), and the selected model also showed high values of R(2)train , 0.915, Pearson-r, 0.801 and low value of SD, 0.241. The contour maps corresponding to the selected 3D-QSAR model, in combination with docking analysis, helped to explore the essential amino acid residues involved in binding, and structural requirements of the ligand molecules necessary for complementary fit with the active site of the protein. Therefore, the information revealed from the generated model can further be explored as a novel tool for the designing of new congener molecules that can serve as potential therapeutics for the treatment of various disease conditions associated with abnormal PKC-\u03b8 signalling."

LST8 is a component of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Herein, to examine the role of LST8, a common component of mTOR complexes, in the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2, first, we showed over-expression of LST8 in HepG2 to markedly enhance basal phosphorylation levels of not only p70 S6 kinase but also Akt. In contrast, LST8 knockdown by siRNA in HepG2 decreased phosphorylation levels of both p70 S6 kinase and Akt. These results indicate the LST8 expression level to determine basal mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, since LST8 appears to be the component present at the lowest level in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Previously, we reported S6 kinase phosphorylation to be reduced by over-expression of the Cterminally deleted Raptor mutant (Raptor-\u0394CT) not binding to mTOR or LST8, while phosphorylation levels of Akt were markedly enhanced with no alteration in IRS-1 phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase activity. Using Raptor-\u0394CT, we investigated the competition for association with LST8 between mTORC1 and mTORC2. Over-expression of Raptor-\u0394CT abolished formation of the Raptor, S6 kinase, mTOR and LST8 complex, while the amount of LST8 in the Rictor-mTOR complex was increased. Therefore, it is likely that Raptor-mTOR and Rictor-mTOR complexes compete for association with LST8, and this mechanism may contribute to the reciprocal negative regulations of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities, in terms of their LST8 components.:"

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disorder that is highly variable in its clinical presentation. Current molecular diagnostic methods permit identification of mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 in 75-85% of TSC patients. Here we examine the clinical characteristics of those TSC patients who have no mutation identified (NMI). A retrospective review of our patient population that had comprehensive testing for mutations in TSC1/TSC2 identified 23/157 (15%) that were NMI. NMI patients had a lower incidence of brain findings on imaging studies, neurological features, and renal findings than those with TSC2 mutations. In contrast, NMI patients had a lower incidence of seizures than TSC patients with TSC1 mutations, but had a higher incidence of both renal angiomyolipomas and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. This distinct constellation of findings suggest that NMI patients may have a unique molecular pathogenesis, different from that seen in TSC patients with the usual mutations in TSC1 and TSC2. We suggest that the mechanisms of disease in these patients include both mosaicism for a TSC2 mutation, and unusual non-coding region mutations in TSC2."

Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the cardiovascular and renal systems are interdependent. Primary disorders of either system have been shown to disturb the other system. As a result, a class of cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) has been identified where in a vicious cycle is established in which acute/chronic dysfunction of either the kidney or the heart exacerbates the loss of function in the other organ. The ADQI organization has proposed a classification derived from a consensus conference held in 2008. CRS is classified as a disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other. The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney. A major problem with previous terminology was that it did not allow for identification of pathophysiological interactions occurring in the different types of combined heart/kidney disorders. The subdivision into different subtypes seems to provide a better approach to this syndrome."

METHODS: The results of 398 patient screens were collected. Data from the set were divided into training and validation subsets. The Mentzer ratio was determined through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve on the first subset, and screened for thalassemia using the second subset. HgbA2 levels were used to confirm beta-thalassemia. RESULTS: We determined the correct decision point of the Mentzer index to be a ratio of 20. Physicians can screen patients using this index before further evaluation for beta-thalassemia (P < .05).

UNLABELLED: FOP is a disabling disorder in which skeletal muscle is progressively replaced with bone. Lymphocytes, our model system for examining BMP signaling, cannot signal through the canonical Smad pathway unless exogenous Smad1 is supplied, providing a unique cell type in which the BMP-p38 MAPK pathway can be examined. FOP lymphocytes exhibit defects in the BMP-p38 MAPK pathway, suggesting that altered BMP signaling underlies ectopic bone formation in this disease. INTRODUCTION: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification of connective tissues. Whereas the primary genetic defect in this condition is unknown, BMP4 mRNA and protein and BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA) protein are overexpressed in cultured lymphocytes from FOP patients, supporting that altered BMP signaling is involved in this disease. In this study, we examined downstream signaling targets to study the BMP-Smad and BMP-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in FOP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Protein phosphorylation was assayed by immunoblots, and p38 MAPK activity was measured by kinase assays. To examine BMP target genes, the mRNA expression of ID1, ID3, and MSX2 was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or ANOVA. RESULTS: FOP lymphocytes exhibited increased levels of p38 phosphorylation and p38 MAPK activity in response to BMP4 stimulation. Furthermore, in response to BMP4, FOP cells overexpressed the downstream signaling targets ID1 by 5-fold and ID3 by 3-fold compared with controls. ID1 and ID3 mRNA induction was specifically blocked with a p38 MAPK inhibitor, but not extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors. MSX2, a known Smad pathway target gene, is not upregulated in control or FOP cells in response to BMP, suggesting that lymphocytes do not use this limb of the BMP pathway. However, introduction of Smad1 into lymphocytes made the cells competent to regulate MSX2 mRNA after BMP4 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytes are a cell system that signals primarily through the BMP-p38 MAPK pathway rather than the BMP-Smad pathway in response to BMP4. The p38 MAPK pathway is dysregulated in FOP lymphocytes, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of FOP."

Despite distinct time-dependent autophosphorylation kinetics by monitoring the phosphorylation of amino acid residues T68, S19, S33/35, T432, in Chk2 wildtype and Chk2 mutants (T68A, T68D and Q69E) they gave identical specific activities. However, upon gel filtration of Chk2 wildtype and the mutants, only Chk2 wildtype and the T68D mutant led to the formation of a 'pure' dimer; dephosphorylated wildtype Chk2 eluted as a monomer. Transfection of HEK293 cells with Chk2 wildtype and Chk2 mutants in the absence or presence of DNA damage showed significant T68 phosphorylation already in the absence of DNA damaging reagents. Upon DNA damage, phosphorylation of additional Chk2 sites was observed (S19, S33/35). A comparison of ATM+/+ and ATM-/- cells with respect to phosphorylation of residues T68, S19, S33/35 in the absence and presence of DNA damage showed in all cases phosphorylation of T68, although signal intensity was increased ca. three-fold after DNA damage. Mass spectrometric analyses of human recombinant Chk2 isolated from bacteria and insect cells showed distinct differences. The number of phosphorylated residues in human recombinant Chk2 isolated from bacteria was 16, whereas in the case of the recombinant human Chk2 from insect cells it was 8. Except for phosphorylated amino acid T378 which was not found in the Chk2 isolated from bacteria, all other phosphorylated residues identified in human Chk2 from insect cells were present also in Chk2 from bacteria."

Our recent studies showed that miRNAs exhibit genomic alterations at a high frequency and their expression is remarkably deregulated in ovarian cancer, strongly suggesting that miRNAs are involved in the initiation and progression of this disease. In the present study, we performed miRNA microarray to identify the miRNAs associated with chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer and found that let-7i expression was significantly reduced in chemotherapy-resistant patients (n = 69, P = 0.003). This result was further validated by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR (n = 62, P = 0.015). Both loss-of-function (by synthetic let-7i inhibitor) and gain-of-function (by retroviral overexpression of let-7i) studies showed that reduced let-7i expression significantly increased the resistance of ovarian and breast cancer cells to the chemotherapy drug, cis-platinum. Finally, using miRNA microarray, we found that decreased let-7i expression was significantly associated with the shorter progression-free survival of patients with late-stage ovarian cancer (n = 72, P = 0.042). This finding was further validated in the same sample set by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-PCR (n = 62, P = 0.001) and in an independent sample set by in situ hybridization (n = 53, P = 0.049). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that let-7i might be used as a therapeutic target to modulate platinum-based chemotherapy and as a biomarker to predict chemotherapy response and survival in patients with ovarian cancer."

CONTEXT: Familial hypophosphatemic rickets is usually transmitted as an X-linked dominant disorder (XLH), although autosomal dominant forms have also been observed. Genetic studies of these disorders have identified mutations in PHEX and FGF23 as the causes of X-linked dominant disorder and autosomal dominant forms, respectively. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to describe the molecular genetic findings in a family affected by hypophosphatemic rickets with presumed autosomal dominant inheritance. PATIENTS: We studied a family in which the father and the elder of his two daughters, but not the second daughter, were affected by hypophosphatemic rickets. The pedigree interpretation of the family suggested that genetic transmission of the disorder occurred as an autosomal dominant trait. METHODS AND RESULTS: Direct nucleotide sequencing of FGF23 and PHEX revealed that the elder daughter was heterozygous for an R567X mutation in PHEX, rather than FGF23, suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an X-linked dominant trait. Unexpectedly, the father was heterozygous for this mutation. Single-nucleotide primer extension and denaturing HPLC analysis of the father using DNA from single hair roots revealed that he was a somatic mosaic for the mutation. Haplotype analysis confirmed that the father transmitted the genotypes for 18 markers on the X chromosome equally to his two daughters. The fact that the father transmitted the mutation to only one of his two daughters indicated that he was a germline mosaic for the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and germline mosaicism for an X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX may mimic autosomal dominant inheritance."

HHT is caused by either mutations in SMAD4 or other genes that modulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling. Additional genes in the TGF\u03b2 network include FBN1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2, mutations of which cause either Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), respectively. As SMAD4, FBN1, and TGFBR1/2 map to different regions of the genome, disorders associated with mutations in these genes are not expected to co-segregate in a family. We report an individual whose family history was positive for aortopathy, mitral valve dysfunction, and JPS. Mutation analysis of SMAD4 implicates this gene for these phenotypes in this family. Although SMAD4 is among several genes in the TGF\u03b2 network, and although prior single case reports have described large vessel aneurysms in HHT, this is the first description of aortic and mitral disease presenting with JPS. This observation suggests that, in addition to HHT, individuals with SMAD4 mutations may be at risk for aortic dilation and mitral valve dysfunction.

Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. Although further studies are required to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns, these associations suggest that genetic adaptation to high altitude involves alteration in energy utilization pathways."

BACKGROUND: Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B. OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologic role of DNM2 in CMT. METHODS: We performed a mutational screening of DNM2 exons 13 through 16 encoding the pleckstrin homology domain in a large series of CMT patients with a broad range of nerve conduction velocities and without mutations in more common genes. RESULTS: We identified two novel DNM2 mutations that cosegregated with purely axonal CMT in two pedigrees without clinical evidence of primary myopathy. CONCLUSION: Patients with axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 neuropathy without mutations in more common genes should undergo investigation for DNM2 pleckstrin homology."

The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial program for the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors that involves loss of cell-cell adhesion and increased cell mobility; however, mechanisms underlying this transition are not fully elucidated. Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. We found that forced expression of SIRT1 in non-transformed PZ-HPV-7 prostate epithelial cells disrupts the epithelial morphology concomitant with decreased expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell-cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells. We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. Specifically, we show that SIRT1 silencing reduces expression of ZEB1 and that SIRT1 is recruited to the E-cadherin proximal promoter by ZEB1 to deacetylate histone H3 and to reduce binding of RNA polymerase II, ultimately suppressing E-cadherin transcription. We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT. Finally, we show that reduction of SIRT1 decreases prostate cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo in immunodeficient mice, which is largely independent of any general effects of SIRT1 on prostate cancer growth and survival. We therefore identify SIRT1 as a positive regulator of EMT and metastatic growth of prostate cancer cells and our findings implicate overexpressed SIRT1 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse EMT and to prevent prostate cancer progression."

CCN1 is a matricellular protein and a member of the CCN family of growth factors. CCN1 is associated with the development of various cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness. CCN1 mRNA and protein were detected in the early precursor lesions, and their expression intensified with disease progression. However, biochemical activity and the molecular targets of CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells are unknown. Here we show that CCN1 regulates the Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the PDAC progression and poor prognosis. SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1. Notably, active Notch-1is recruited by CCN1 in these cells via the inhibition of proteasomal degradation results in stabilization of the receptor. We find that CCN1-induced activation of SHh signaling might be necessary for CCN1-dependent in vitro pancreatic cancer cell migration and tumorigenicity of the side population of pancreatic cancer cells (cancer stem cells) in a xenograft in nude mice. Moreover, the functional role of CCN1 could be mediated through the interaction with the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptor. These extensive studies propose that targeting CCN1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking CCN1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. SHh and Notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance."

BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait associated with risk of sudden death. The majority of cases of sudden death occur in young adults with no or few symptoms, which underlines the importance of risk stratification as a basis for selecting a therapeutic strategy. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are indicated in patients resuscitated following cardiac arrest, and those with sustained ventricular tachycardia or two or more risk factors identified in non-invasive tests. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the number of appropriate therapies (anti-tachycardia pacing and defibrillation) and the risk factors, or association of risk factors, that predict therapies in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. METHODS: We studied 17 consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardioverter-defibrillators implanted between December 1992 and June 2003. The following risk factors were analyzed: 1) previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia; 2) family history of sudden cardiac death; 3) high-risk genetic mutations; 4) syncope; 5) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 6) hypotensive response to exercise; and 7) marked left ventricular hypertrophy. Appropriate therapies were determined and the predictive value of the different sudden death risk stratification parameters was analyzed. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 40 +/- 29 months, 7 patients (41%) received a total of 293 appropriate therapies. Of the 9 patients with previous cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia, 4 received appropriate therapies. In the remaining 8 patients, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention, 3 received appropriate therapies. Family history of sudden death was associated with a positive predictive value of 25% for appropriate therapies, 40% for syncope and 50% for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The presence of any two risk factors was associated with a positive predictive value of 33% and the presence of three factors with 100%. CONCLUSION: In this group of patients, considered to be at high risk for sudden cardiac death, a considerable percentage had ventricular tachycardias that were correctly identified and treated by the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The percentage of patients with appropriate therapies was slightly higher in the group who had a cardioverter-defibrillator for secondary prevention of sudden death (aborted sudden death or sustained ventricular tachycardia). In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the risk factor with the highest predictive value. An association of risk factors was also predictive of arrhythmic events."

Triple-negative breast cancer is difficult to treat because of the lack of rationale-based therapies. There are no established markers and targets that can be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74. Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed, it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer.

Upon being induced by TGF-beta or with a conditional expression system in lung epithelial cells, p15(Ink4b) binds to and inhibits the cyclin D-dependent kinases, prevents p27 binding to these cdk complexes, and promotes p27 binding and inhibition of cyclin-cdk2.

We present evidence that the different subcellular location of p15 and p27 ensures the prior access of p15 to cdk4. In the cell, p15 is localized mostly in the cytoplasm, whereas p27 is nuclear. p15 prevails over p27 or a p27 construct consisting of the cdk inhibitory domain tagged with a nuclear localization signal. However, when p15 and p27 are forced to reside in the same subcellular location, either the cytoplasm or the nucleus, p15 no longer prevents p27 from binding to cdk4.

The transcription factor NF-kappaB is essential for osteoclastogenesis and is considered an immune-modulator of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory osteolysis. Activation of NF-kappaB subunits is regulated by the upstream IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex which contains IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and IKKgamma; the latter also known as NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). The role of IKKalpha and IKKbeta in the skeletal development and inflammatory osteolysis has been described, whereas little is known regarding the role of NEMO in this setting. Typically, signals induced by RANK ligand (RANKL) or TNF prompt oligomerization of NEMO monomers through the coiled-coil-2 (CC2) and leucine zipper (LZ) motifs. This step facilitates binding to IKKs and further relaying signal transduction. Given the central role of NF-kappaB in osteoclastogenesis, we asked whether NEMO is essential for osteoclastogenesis and whether interruption of NEMO oligomerization impedes osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Using cell-permeable short peptides overlapping the CC2 and LZ motifs we show that these peptides specifically bind to NEMO monomers, prevent trimer formation, and render NEMO monomers susceptible for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Further, CC2 and LZ peptides attenuate RANKL- and TNF-induced NF-kappaB signaling in bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors (OCPs). More importantly, these peptides potently inhibit osteoclastogenesis, in vitro, and arrest RANKL-induced osteolysis, in mice. To further ascertain its role in osteoclastogenesis, we were able to block osteoclastogenesis using NEMO siRNA knockdown approach. Collectively, our data establish that obstruction of NEMO oligomerization destabilizes NEMO monomers, inhibits NF-kappaB activation, impedes osteoclastogenesis and arrests inflammatory osteolysis. Thus, NEMO presents itself as a promising target for anti-osteolytic intervention."

Forty-one patients (25%) underwent composite graft aortic valve replacement, and 125 patients (75%) underwent aortic valve-sparing procedures; both groups had similar prevalences of MR grade >2 (P=0.7). Thirty-three patients (20%) underwent concomitant mitral valve (MV) intervention (repair, n=29; replacement, n=4), including all 15 patients with MR grade >2. Only 1 patient required MV reintervention during follow-up (mean clinical follow-up, 31 \u00b1 10 months). Echocardiography performed 21 \u00b1 13 months postoperatively revealed MR >2 in only 3 patients (2%). One early death and 2 late deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of patients with Marfan syndrome who undergo elective aortic root replacement have MVP, only 20% have concomitant MV procedures. These concomitant procedures do not seem to increase operative risk. In patients with MR grade < 2 who do not undergo a concomitant MV procedure, the short-term incidence of progressive MR is low; however, more follow-up is needed to determine whether patients with MVP and MR grade < 2 would benefit from prophylactic MV intervention."

The first case of noncompaction was described in 1932 after an autopsy performed on a newborn infant with aortic atresia/coronary-ventricular fistula. Isolated noncompaction cardiomyopathy was first described in 1984. A review on selected/relevant medical literature was conducted using Pubmed from 1984 to 2013 and the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management are discussed. Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a relatively rare congenital condition that results from arrest of the normal compaction process of the myocardium during fetal development. LVNC shows variability in its genetic pattern, pathophysiologic findings, and clinical presentations. The genetic heterogeneity, phenotypical overlap, and variety in clinical presentation raised the suspicion that LVNC might just be a morphological variant of other cardiomyopathies, but the American Heart Association classifies LVNC as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy. The familiar type is common and follows a X-linked, autosomal-dominant, or mitochondrial-inheritance pattern (in children). LVNC can occur in isolation or coexist with other cardiac and/or systemic anomalies. The clinical presentations are variable ranging from asymptomatic patients to patients who develop ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Increased awareness over the last 25 years and improvements in technology have increased the identification of this illness and improved the clinical outcome and prognosis. LVNC is commonly diagnosed by echocardiography. Other useful diagnostic techniques for LVNC include cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, and left ventriculography. Management is symptom based and patients with symptoms have a poorer prognosis. LVNC is a genetically heterogeneous disorder which can be associated with other anomalies. Making the correct diagnosis is important because of the possible associations and the need for long-term management and screening of living relatives."

INTRODUCTION: Leptomeningeal metastases are occurring at higher frequency in cancer patients. The prognosis of leptomeningeal metastases is poor and standard treatment, which includes radiotherapy and chemotherapy, is mostly ineffective. Melanoma represents one of the tumors with the highest incidence of leptomeningeal metastases. For such a disease, the BRAF inhibitors have recently been demonstrated to be effective on melanoma brain metastases harboring the V600EBRAF mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 39-year-old Italian woman with advanced melanoma with brain, lung and peritoneum metastases harboring the V600EBRAF mutation. In August 2010 she was enrolled into the BRIM3 trial and after the randomization process she received dacarbazine. After two cycles, there was evidence of disease progression in her peritoneum and lung. For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy. She had a partial response that was maintained until 13 weeks of treatment. In January 2011 she developed symptoms typical for brain metastases and received a diagnosis of leptomeningeal involvement of melanoma cells after an examination of her cerebral spinal fluid; magnetic resonance imaging was negative for meningitis or brain metastases. Analysis of her cerebral spinal fluid sample confirmed that the melanoma cells still carried the V600EBRAF mutation. After a few days, our patient went into a coma and died. CONCLUSION: Starting with a clinical case, we discuss the pathogenesis of leptomeningeal metastases and whether the leptomeninges may represent a sanctuary where melanoma cells may generate resistance and/or BRAF inhibitors cannot reach an adequate concentration for significant activity. We assess whether treatment with BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients should be interrupted as soon as disease progression appears or continued beyond progression, through the administration of additional compounds."

Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. TTFields were shown to destroy cells within the process of mitosis via apoptosis, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. TTFields have no effect on non-dividing cells. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, demonstrating the activity of TTFields both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with several cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, it summarizes the clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol. Importantly, quality of life was also better in the TTFields group. The second indication was a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. This combination resulted in an excellent median OS of 13.8 months. Interestingly, the progression-free survival (PFS) within the area of the TTFields was 28, however, outside the TTFields the PFS was only 22 weeks. EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor types. The side effects of TTFields were minimal and in general consisted of skin reaction to the electrodes. There are a number of ways in which TTFields could be further evaluated, for example, in combination with chemotherapy, as a maintenance treatment, or as a salvage therapy if radiotherapy or surgery is not possible. While more clinical data are clearly needed, TTFields is an emerging and promising novel treatment concept."

The test performance of this microarray was evaluated with 95 Enterobacteriaceae isolates suspected of being carbapenemase producers, i.e. with meropenem MICs > 0.5 mg l(-1). The collection of isolates contained 70 carbapenemase-producing isolates, including 37 bla(KPC)-, 20 bla(VIM)-, five bla(OXA-48)-, four bla(KPC)/bla(VIM)- and four bla(NDM)-positive isolates; and 25 carbapenemase-gene-negative isolates. ESBLs were produced by 51 of the isolates. PCR and sequencing of \u03b2-lactamase genes was used as reference test. For detection of carbapenemases, the sensitivity of the microarray was 97% (68/70), with 100% specificity. The two negative isolates tested positive when the microarray test was repeated; these isolates were an OXA-48- and a KPC-producing isolate. For ESBL detection, the sensitivity was 100% (51/51) and the specificity was 98% (43/44), although 20% of the SHV-12 ESBLs were categorized as SHV-2-like ESBLs. In conclusion, the CDT102 microarray is a rapid and accurate tool for the detection of carbapenemase and ESBL genes, although the array seems less suitable for epidemiology of ESBL genes."

L1 and Alu represent the most prolific human LINE and SINE families, respectively. Only a few Alu elements are able to retropose, and the factors determining their retroposition capacity are poorly understood. The data presented in this paper indicate that the length of Alu \"A-tails\" is one of the principal factors in determining the retropositional capability of an Alu element. The A stretches of the Alu subfamilies analyzed, both old (Alu S and J) and young (Ya5), had a Poisson distribution of A-tail lengths with a mean size of 21 and 26, respectively. In contrast, the A-tails of very recent Alu insertions (disease causing) were all between 40 and 97 bp in length. The L1 elements analyzed displayed a similar tendency, in which the \"disease\"-associated elements have much longer A-tails (mean of 77) than do the elements even from the young Ta subfamily (mean of 41). Analysis of the draft sequence of the human genome showed that only about 1000 of the over one million Alu elements have tails of 40 or more adenosine residues in length. The presence of these long A stretches shows a strong bias toward the actively amplifying subfamilies, consistent with their playing a major role in the amplification process. Evaluation of the 19 Alu elements retrieved from the draft sequence of the human genome that are identical to the Alu Ya5a2 insert in the NF1 gene showed that only five have tails with 40 or more adenosine residues. Sequence analysis of the loci with the Alu elements containing the longest A-tails (7 of the 19) from the genomes of the NF1 patient and the father revealed that there are at least two loci with A-tails long enough to serve as source elements within our model. Analysis of the A-tail lengths of 12 Ya5a2 elements in diverse human population groups showed substantial variability in both the Alu A-tail length and sequence homogeneity. On the basis of these observations, a model is presented for the role of A-tail length in determining which Alu elements are active."

BACKGROUND: The cumulative cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is thought to result from the generation of free radicals. New DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors less prone to redox reactions, such as mitoxantrone and more recently the anthrapyrazoles, were developed to circumvent this toxicity. PURPOSE: Two anthrapyrazoles currently in clinical evaluation, DuP 941 (Losoxantrone) and DuP 937, were compared to other topoisomerase II inhibitors with respect to their cytotoxic potency and selectivity and with respect to topoisomerase II inhibition. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was tested in the 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute preclinical antitumor drug discovery screen (NCI screen). The potency of anthrapyrazoles to inhibit purified topoisomerase II was determined. The specificity of drug-induced topoisomerase II pattern of cleavage, one of the cellular determinants of cytotoxicity, was investigated in human c-myc DNA. RESULTS: Using the COMPARE analysis, we found that the most closely related cytotoxic profiles in the NCI screen were between the anthrapyrazoles and mitoxantrone. Among topoisomerase II inhibitors, the cytostatic potency was by decreasing order: mitoxantrone; doxorubicin, which was slightly greater than DuP 941, azatoxin; DuP 937; and amsacrine, which was much greater than VP-16. The potency of mitoxantrone and anthrapyrazoles to generate DNA double-strand breaks, by induction of the topoisomerase II cleavable complexes in nuclear extracts, was in agreement with cytotoxicity. Sequencing of drug-induced topoisomerase II cleavages in c-myc DNA showed a common cleavage pattern for anthrapyrazoles and mitoxantrone. This pattern was different from the patterns obtained with other topoisomerase II inhibitors. CONCLUSION: At the molecular and cellular levels, anthrapyrazoles are potent topoisomerase II inhibitors closely related to mitoxantrone. IMPLICATIONS: These results validate the COMPARE analysis using the NCI screen to predict molecular mechanisms of drug action. Anthrapyrazoles, which are unlikely to produce free radicals, might be useful in the same indications as mitoxantrone, especially for patients with cardiac risks, for pediatric patients, and for patients treated with intensified protocols."

Aberrant cytosine methylation in promoter regions leads to gene silencing associated with cancer progression. A number of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are known to reactivate silenced genes; including 5-azacytidine and 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine). Zebularine is a more stable, less cytotoxic inhibitor compared to 5-azacytidine. To determine the mechanistic basis for this difference, we carried out a detailed comparisons of the interaction between purified DNA methyltransferases and oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) containing either 5-azacytosine or 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone in place of the cytosine targeted for methylation. When incorporated into small ODNs, the rate of C5 DNA methyltransferase inhibition by both nucleosides is essentially identical. However, the stability and reversibility of the enzyme complex in the absence and presence of cofactor differs. 5-Azacytosine ODNs form complexes with C5 DNA methyltransferases that are irreversible when the 5-azacytosine ring is intact. ODNs containing 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone at the enzymatic target site are competitive inhibitors of both prokaryotic and mammalian DNA C5 methyltransferases. We determined that the ternary complexes between the enzymes, 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone inhibitor, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine are maintained through the formation of a reversible covalent interaction. The differing stability and reversibility of the covalent bonds may partially account for the observed differences in cytotoxicity between zebularine and 5-azacytidine inhibitors."

Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment. The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. Although further studies are required to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns, these associations suggest that genetic adaptation to high altitude involves alteration in energy utilization pathways."

GABARAPL1 is involved in the intracellular transport of receptors, via an interaction with tubulin and GABA(A) or kappa opioid receptors, and also participates in autophagy and cell proliferation. In the present study, we identify the HSP90 protein as a novel interaction partner for GABARAPL1 using GST pull-down, mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. GABARAPL1 and HSP90 partially colocalize in MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressed Dsred-GABARAPL1 and in rat brain. Moreover, treatment of MCF-7 cells overexpressed FLAG-GABARAPL1-6HIS with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG promotes the GABARAPL1 degradation, a process that is blocked by proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, bortezomib and lactacystin. Accordingly, we demonstrate that HSP90 interacts and protects GABARAPL1 from its degradation by the proteasome."

The study included 54 patients; 20 non-smokers, 9 ex-smokers, 14 mild to moderate smokers and 11 heavy smokers. Fifteen normal volunteers were also studied as controls. Disease stage was clinically and radiologically determined, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies were measured in serum. Higher percentage of severe disease (stage III) was seen in heavy smoker patients than mild to moderate smokers (54.6% versus 35.7%) and in moderate smokers than ex-smokers (35.7% versus 33.6%). Lowest percentage of severe disease was seen in non-smokers (15%). RF and anti-CCP were significantly higher in smoker than non-smoker and in heavy than mild to moderate smoker patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively).

We report on a 29-year-old man who suffered from dysmnesia, disturbance of orientation, cognitive impairment, and double vision. His history revealed several front-line operations in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf War. Physical examinations showed a complex eye-movement disturbance and a horizontal nystagmus, which was neuro-ophthalmologically confirmed. The early auditory potentials referred to a brainstem dysfunction and the cognitive disturbances correlated to changes in the late-appearing component of event-related potentials (P 300). Brain imaging with CCT, MRI, SPECT, PET, and EEG and CSF showed no pathologies. Neuropsychological tests disclosed severe cognitive impairment especially concerning memory. Three-month follow-up studies in a department of psychosomatic medicine excluded a dissociative disorder as a feature of a post-traumatic stress or a conversion disorder. This is the first case of Gulf War syndrome in Germany. We focus on an unfamiliar complication after the war. The recent literature is reviewed."

BACKGROUND: We sought to identify preoperative factors significantly correlated with survival. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems. Moreover, we suggest modified criteria for selecting treatment strategies. METHODS: In total, the outcomes of 112 patients with spinal metastasis who underwent surgery between January 2006 and June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The validity of the prognostic scores was assessed on the basis of their correlation with survival. For various primary malignancies, new scoring criteria were applied in each system according to the survival results obtained in this study. Each revised scoring system was adjusted with a similar principle of scoring as described previously. Patient survival according to each preoperative factor was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive value of each scoring system was evaluated by the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The interval from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to that of spinal metastasis (p = 0.023) and the interval from the diagnosis of spinal metastasis to surgery (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with survival. Regarding Tokuhashi scores, the correlation coefficient was 0.790 before adjustment (p = 0.001) and 0.853 after adjustment (p < 0.001). For Tomita scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.994 (p < 0.001) both before and after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores. It is helpful to evaluate both scoring systems with adjustment for primary malignancy depending on the clinical setting. Patients with Tomita scores less than or equal to 8 and Tokuhashi scores greater than or equal to 6 are recommended to undergo surgical management."

Ribosome biogenesis is an energy consuming process which takes place mainly in the nucleolus. By producing ribosomes to fuel protein synthesis, it is tightly connected with cell growth and cell cycle control. Perturbation of ribosome biogenesis leads to the activation of p53 tumor suppressor protein promoting processes like cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence. This ribosome biogenesis stress pathway activates p53 through sequestration of MDM2 by a subset of ribosomal proteins (RPs), thereby stabilizing p53. Here, we identify human HEATR1, as a nucleolar protein which positively regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. Downregulation of HEATR1 resulted in cell cycle arrest in a manner dependent on p53. Moreover, depletion of HEATR1 also caused disruption of nucleolar structure and activated the ribosomal biogenesis stress pathway - RPL5 / RPL11 dependent stabilization and activation of p53. These findings reveal an important role for HEATR1 in ribosome biogenesis and further support the concept that perturbation of ribosome biosynthesis results in p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation, with implications for human pathologies including cancer."

Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail. Methylated ARK(S/T) motifs have recently been identified in other chromatin factors (e.g. linker histone H1.4 and lysine methyltransferase G9a). These are thought to function as peripheral docking sites for the HP1 chromodomain. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. These have putative functions ranging from establishment of histone H4 acetylation during spermiogenesis to regulation of transcription co-repressor complexes. To delineate the biochemical functions of the CDY family chromodomains, we analyzed their specificity of methyllysine recognition. We detected substantial differences among these factors. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. However, point mutations can rescue binding. In support of the in vitro binding properties of the chromodomains, the full-length CDY family proteins exhibit substantial variability in chromatin localization. Our studies underscore the significance of subtle sequence differences in a conserved signaling module for diverse epigenetic regulatory pathways."

However, conflicts between the different principles are commonplace in psychiatric practice, especially in forensic psychiatry, where duties to patients often conflict with duties to third parties such as the public. This article seeks to highlight some of the specific ethical dilemmas encountered in forensic psychiatry: the excessive use of segregation for the protection of others, the ethics of using mechanical restraint when clinically beneficial and the use of physical treatment without consent. We argue that justice, as a principle, should be paramount in forensic psychiatry, and that there is a need for a more specific code of ethics to cover specialised areas of medicine like forensic psychiatry. This code should specify that in cases of conflict between different principles, justice should gain precedence over the other principles."

Furthermore, CYP2C9 variant genotypes have been associated with a significantly increased risk of serious bleeding events.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac manifestations of Marfan syndrome include aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Only scant data exist describing MVP in patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing aortic root replacement. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 166 MFS patients with MVP who were enrolled in a prospective multicenter registry of patients who underwent aortic root aneurysm repair. Of these 166 patients, 9% had mitral regurgitation (MR) grade >2, and 10% had MR grade 2. The severity of MVP and MR was evaluated by echocardiography preoperatively and < 3 years postoperatively. Forty-one patients (25%) underwent composite graft aortic valve replacement, and 125 patients (75%) underwent aortic valve-sparing procedures; both groups had similar prevalences of MR grade >2 (P=0.7). Thirty-three patients (20%) underwent concomitant mitral valve (MV) intervention (repair, n=29; replacement, n=4), including all 15 patients with MR grade >2. Only 1 patient required MV reintervention during follow-up (mean clinical follow-up, 31 \u00b1 10 months). Echocardiography performed 21 \u00b1 13 months postoperatively revealed MR >2 in only 3 patients (2%). One early death and 2 late deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of patients with Marfan syndrome who undergo elective aortic root replacement have MVP, only 20% have concomitant MV procedures. These concomitant procedures do not seem to increase operative risk. In patients with MR grade < 2 who do not undergo a concomitant MV procedure, the short-term incidence of progressive MR is low; however, more follow-up is needed to determine whether patients with MVP and MR grade < 2 would benefit from prophylactic MV intervention."

METHODS: The standard ABCD2 score was compared to modified scores incorporating various combinations of acute BP elevation or hyperglycemia, history of hypertension or diabetes, and subsequent versus initial ED BP measurements. The number of patients reclassified into an alternate risk category (low/moderate/high) with different schemes was determined. Predictive value using the composite outcome of stroke, death, or high-risk transient ischemic attack mechanism was assessed using c statistics. RESULTS: Modified ABCD2 scores resulted in few patients shifting risk categories (between 2% and 10% for six alternate schemes), and did not improve the performance of the ABCD2 score (c-statistics, 0.61-0.65, compared to 0.63 for the standard score). ED triage hypertension was frequent (mean systolic blood pressure [SBP]/diastolic blood pressure [DBP] decrease of 8/9 mm Hg on subsequent measurement; P < .001), but the use of second BP did not reclassify many patients (10%) nor did it improve score performance (c-statistic, 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of the ABCD2 score changed the risk category for few patients and did not improve the overall predictive value of the score."

Hedgehog (Hh) plays a pivotal role in various tissues during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis. In mammals, Hh exists in three homologs: Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In this study, we cloned full-length cDNAs encoding Dhh and Ihh from the rat uterus. Their amino acid sequences have a high homology with those of the mouse and human. In addition, the changes of Hh gene expression in the rat uterus during early pregnancy were analyzed. The results showed that all three hedgehog mRNAs were detected in the rat uterus at the proestrus stage and during early pregnancy (1.5, 3.5, 5.5 and 7.5 days post coitus: dpc). Ihh mRNA expression varied and peaked at 3.5 dpc in the luminal and glandular epithelium. Expression was decreased on 5.5 dpc with the exception of sustained expression in the glandular epithelium. Despite such Ihh variability, the expressions of Dhh and Shh mRNA remained unchanged. This indicated that Ihh was mainly expressed in the rat uterus during early pregnancy. Moreover, the Hh target gene (glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1; Gli1) was also highly expressed at 3.5 dpc in the epithelium and periepithelial stroma in a manner similar to the temporal pattern of Ihh expression. This suggests that Ihh signaling axis play a role in the rat uterus during early pregnancy. In summary, our results elucidate that Ihh is a predominant Hh protein in the rat uterus during early pregnancy and that other Hhs have the potential to be expressed. This observation will help to elucidate the basic molecular mechanism of rat uterus during early pregnancy."

Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inheritable bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation, dystrophic nails and oral leukoplakia. Another name for the condition is Zinsser-Cole-Engman syndrome. Hematologic manifestations usually do not appear in childhood but later in early adulthood. Patients are also prone to carcinomas, particularly of the head and neck. The disease has X-linked or autosomal dominant/recessive inheritance. Early childhood variants (Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome) are associated with immunological abnormalities in the form of low T- and B-cell numbers. Four genes, namely DKC1 (codes for dyskerin), TERC and TERT (code for telomerase) and NOP10, have been implicated in the pathogenesis; the short telomeres provide a marker for genetic linkage studies. Androgens, with or without granulocyte colony stimulating factor, have been tried in the treatment of the conditions with variable results. Stem cell transplantation from matched sibling donor is currently the treatment of choice. It requires modified nonmyeloablative conditioning protocols, since the patients with DC are prone to pulmonary and hepatic complications."

PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the cell of origin (COO) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), prospectively treated by rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) versus rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and followed by intensive therapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation on the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among the 396 patients included on the trial, histologic material was available for a total of 249 patients at diagnosis (n = 189 patients) and/or at relapse (n = 147 patients), which included 87 matched pairs. The patient data were analyzed by immunochemistry for CD10, BCL6, MUM1, FOXP1, and BCL2 expression and by fluorescent in situ hybridization for BCL2, BCL6 and c-MYC breakpoints. The correlation with survival data was performed by using the log-rank test and the Cox model. RESULTS: Characteristics of immunophenotype and chromosomal abnormalities were statistically highly concordant in the matched biopsies. In univariate analysis, the presence of c-MYC gene rearrangement was the only parameter to be significantly correlated with a worse progression-free survival (PFS; P = .02) and a worse overall survival (P = .04). When treatment interaction was tested, the germinal center B (GCB) -like DLBCL that was based on the algorithm by Hans was significantly associated with a better PFS in the R-DHAP arm. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic relevance was found for the GCB/non-GCB the Hans phenotype interaction treatment (P = .04), prior rituximab exposure (P = .0052), secondary age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (P = .039), and FoxP1 expression (P = .047). Confirmation was obtained by gene expression profiling in a subset of 39 patients. CONCLUSION: COO remains a major and independent factor in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, with a better response to R-DHAP in GCB-like DLBCL. This needs confirmation by a prospective study."

PURPOSE: Salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Salvage regimens have never been compared; their efficacy in the rituximab era is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP). Responding patients received high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. RESULTS: The median age of the 396 patients enrolled (R-ICE, n = 202; R-DHAP, n = 194) was 55 years. Similar response rates were observed after three cycles of R-ICE (63.5%; 95% CI, 56% to 70%) and R-DHAP (62.8%; 95 CI, 55% to 69%). Factors affecting response rates (P < .001) were refractory disease/relapse less than versus more than 12 months after diagnosis (46% v 88%, respectively), International Prognostic Index (IPI) of more than 1 versus 0 to 1 (52% v 71%, respectively), and prior rituximab treatment versus no prior rituximab (51% v 83%, respectively). There was no significant difference between R-ICE and R-DHAP for 3-year event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival. Three-year EFS was affected by prior rituximab treatment versus no rituximab (21% v 47%, respectively), relapse less than versus more than 12 months after diagnosis (20% v 45%, respectively), and IPI of 2 to 3 versus 0 to 1 (18% v 40%, respectively). In the Cox model, these parameters were significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: In patients who experience relapse more than 12 months after diagnosis, prior rituximab treatment does not affect EFS. Patients with early relapses after rituximab-containing first-line therapy have a poor prognosis, with no difference between the effects of R-ICE and R-DHAP."

OBJECT: Chordoma is a rare type of malignant bone tumor and is known to arise from the remnants of the notochord. Resistance to chemotherapy makes the treatment of chordoma difficult; therefore, new approaches need to be developed to cure this disease. Differentiation therapy, using various differentiating agents, is attracting oncologists as a common therapeutic method to treat other tumors. Based on forcing cells to mature into other lineages, differentiation therapy might be an available method to treat chordomas in addition to conventional therapies. METHODS: In this study a chordoma cell line, U-CH1, was exposed to several chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide, fludarabine, methotrexate, nilotinib, and imatinib mesylate under appropriate conditions. The first group of U-CH1 cells was exposed to drugs only and the second group of cells was exposed to the simultaneous treatment of 1 \u03bcM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapeutic agents in differentiation therapy. The efficacy of the differentiation method was assessed by measuring the viability of U-CH1 cells. RESULTS: Vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, and fludarabine, each at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, decreased the number of chordoma cells when given alone down to 11%, 0%, 30%, 67%, and 3%, respectively. Etoposide and cisplatin, each at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, reduced the percentage of viable chordoma cells in a more effective way when given with 1 \u03bcM ATRA simultaneously, reducing the number of viable cells to 14% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, imatinib and nilotinib, each at a concentration of 3 \u03bcM, as well as 10 \u03bcM methotrexate, showed no decrease in the number of cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that chordoma cells may be treated using the differentiation method in a more effective way than when they are treated with chemotherapeutic agents alone. This new approach may be an alternative method to conventional therapies in the treatment of chordoma."

Notch transmembrane receptors direct essential cellular processes, such as proliferation and differentiation, through direct cell-to-cell interactions. Inappropriate release of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(ICD)) from the plasma membrane results in the accumulation of deregulated nuclear N(ICD) that has been linked to human cancers, notably T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression. Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled. In this study, we demonstrate that N(ICD) multimerizes and that these multimers function as precursors for the stepwise assembly of the Notch activation complex. Importantly, we demonstrate that the assembly is mediated by N(ICD) multimers interacting with Skip and Mastermind. These interactions form a preactivation complex that is then resolved by CSL to form the Notch transcriptional activation complex on DNA."

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become an intriguing approach for neurological disease modeling, because neural lineage-specific cell types that retain the donors' complex genetics can be established in vitro. The statistical power of these iPSC-based models, however, is dependent on accurate diagnoses of the somatic cell donors; unfortunately, many neurodegenerative diseases are commonly misdiagnosed in live human subjects. Postmortem histopathological examination of a donor's brain, combined with premortem clinical criteria, is often the most robust approach to correctly classify an individual as a disease-specific case or unaffected control. In this study, we describe iPSCs generated from a skin biopsy collected postmortem during the rapid autopsy of a 75-year-old male, whole body donor, defined as an unaffected neurological control by both clinical and histopathological criteria. These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Selected iPSC clones expressed both nuclear and surface antigens recognized as pluripotency markers of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and were able to differentiate in vitro into neurons and glia. Statistical analysis also demonstrated that fibroblast proliferation was significantly affected by biopsy site, but not donor age (within an elderly cohort). These results provide evidence that autopsy donor-derived fibroblasts can be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs, and may provide an advantageous approach for generating iPSC-based neurological disease models."

Moyamoya is a cerebrovascular angiopathy characterized by a progressive stenosis of the terminal part of the intracranial carotid arteries and the compensatory development of abnormal and fragile collateral vessels, also called moyamoya vessels, leading to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Moyamoya angiopathy can either be the sole manifestation of the disease (moyamoya disease) or be associated with various conditions, including neurofibromatosis, Down syndrome, TAAD (autosomal-dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm), and radiotherapy of head tumors (moyamoya syndromes). Its prevalence is ten times higher in Japan than in Europe, and an estimated 6%-12% of moyamoya disease is familial in Japan. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this condition remain obscure. Here, we report on three unrelated families affected with an X-linked moyamoya syndrome characterized by the association of a moyamoya angiopathy, short stature, and a stereotyped facial dysmorphism. Other symptoms include an hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, premature coronary heart disease, premature hair graying, and early bilateral acquired cataract. We show that this syndromic moyamoya is caused by Xq28 deletions removing MTCP1/MTCP1NB and BRCC3. We also show that brcc3 morphant zebrafish display angiogenesis defects that are rescued by endothelium-specific expression of brcc3. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that BRCC3, a deubiquitinating enzyme that is part of the cellular BRCA1 and BRISC complexes, is an important player in angiogenesis and that BRCC3 loss-of-function mutations are associated with moyamoya angiopathy."

MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing of mRNA (RNA-Seq) has led to tremendous improvements in the detection of expressed genes and reconstruction of RNA transcripts. However, the extensive dynamic range of gene expression, technical limitations and biases, as well as the observed complexity of the transcriptional landscape, pose profound computational challenges for transcriptome reconstruction. RESULTS: We present the novel framework MITIE (Mixed Integer Transcript IdEntification) for simultaneous transcript reconstruction and quantification. We define a likelihood function based on the negative binomial distribution, use a regularization approach to select a few transcripts collectively explaining the observed read data and show how to find the optimal solution using Mixed Integer Programming. MITIE can (i) take advantage of known transcripts, (ii) reconstruct and quantify transcripts simultaneously in multiple samples, and (iii) resolve the location of multi-mapping reads. It is designed for genome- and assembly-based transcriptome reconstruction. We present an extensive study based on realistic simulated RNA-Seq data. When compared with state-of-the-art approaches, MITIE proves to be significantly more sensitive and overall more accurate. Moreover, MITIE yields substantial performance gains when used with multiple samples. We applied our system to 38 Drosophila melanogaster modENCODE RNA-Seq libraries and estimated the sensitivity of reconstructing omitted transcript annotations and the specificity with respect to annotated transcripts. Our results corroborate that a well-motivated objective paired with appropriate optimization techniques lead to significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in transcriptome reconstruction.

In mesophilic prokaryotes, the DNA-binding protein HU participates in nucleoid organization as well as in regulation of DNA-dependent processes. Little is known about nucleoid organization in thermophilic eubacteria. We show here that HU from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima HU bends DNA and constrains negative DNA supercoils in the presence of topoisomerase I. However, while binding to a single site occludes approximately 35 bp, association of T. maritima HU with DNA of sufficient length to accommodate multiple protomers results in an apparent shorter occluded site size. Such complexes consist of ordered arrays of protomers, as revealed by the periodicity of DNase I cleavage. Association of TmHU with plasmid DNA yields a complex that is remarkably resistant to DNase I-mediated degradation. TmHU is the only member of this protein family capable of occluding a 35 bp nonspecific site in duplex DNA; we propose that this property allows TmHU to form exceedingly stable associations in which DNA flanking the kinks is sandwiched between adjacent proteins. We suggest that T. maritima HU serves an architectural function when associating with a single 35 bp site, but generates a very stable and compact aggregate at higher protein concentrations that organizes and protects the genomic DNA."

Previous studies have shown two homologous chromodomain modules in the HP1 and Polycomb proteins exhibit discriminatory binding to related methyllysine residues (embedded in ARKS motifs) of the histone H3 tail. Methylated ARK(S/T) motifs have recently been identified in other chromatin factors (e.g. linker histone H1.4 and lysine methyltransferase G9a). These are thought to function as peripheral docking sites for the HP1 chromodomain. In vertebrates, HP1-like chromodomains are also present in the chromodomain Y chromosome (CDY) family of proteins adjacent to a putative catalytic motif. The human genome encodes three CDY family proteins, CDY, CDYL, and CDYL2. These have putative functions ranging from establishment of histone H4 acetylation during spermiogenesis to regulation of transcription co-repressor complexes. To delineate the biochemical functions of the CDY family chromodomains, we analyzed their specificity of methyllysine recognition. We detected substantial differences among these factors. The CDY chromodomain exhibits discriminatory binding to lysine-methylated ARK(S/T) motifs, whereas the CDYL2 chromodomain binds with comparable strength to multiple ARK(S/T) motifs. Interestingly, subtle amino acid changes in the CDYL chromodomain prohibit such binding interactions in vitro and in vivo. However, point mutations can rescue binding. In support of the in vitro binding properties of the chromodomains, the full-length CDY family proteins exhibit substantial variability in chromatin localization. Our studies underscore the significance of subtle sequence differences in a conserved signaling module for diverse epigenetic regulatory pathways."

One of the best prognostic predictors for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer is the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) stage at diagnosis. Advanced-stage ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC) generally have poor prognosis. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a miRNA expression profile that can differentiate the OSC at early and advanced stages and study its correlation with the prognosis of OSC. To identify a unique microRNA (miRNA) pattern associated with the progression of OSC at early and advanced stages, a miRNA microarray was performed using Chinese tumor bank specimens of patients with OSC stage I or III in a retrospective analysis. The expression of four dysregulated miRNAs was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in an external cohort of 51 cases of OSC samples at stages I and III. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the expression of some miRNAs and prognosis. Of the 768 miRNAs analyzed in the microarray, 26 miRNAs were significantly either up- or downregulated, with at least a 2-fold difference, in OSC stage I compared with stage III. The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-510, miR-509-5p, and miR-508-3p were significantly downregulated and that miR-483-5p was upregulated in stage III OSC compared with stage I, which was consistent with the microarray results. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that miRNAs may play a role in the progression of OSC, and miR-510 and miR-509-5p may be considered novel-candidate clinical biomarkers for predicting OSC outcome."

BACKGROUND: Cetuximab and panitumumab, mAbs targeting EGFR, are registered for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients whose tumors express EGFR as determined by immunohistochemistry. However, this method is not predictive of treatment efficacy. KRAS, the human homolog of the Kirsten rat sarcoma-2 virus oncogene, encodes a small G-protein that functions downstream of EGFR-induced signalling. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: To examine KRAS mutations as predictive factors of response to anti-EGFR mAbs using recently published data. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Several retrospective studies show that efficacy of these mAbs is confined to patients with wild type KRAS and genotyping of tumors should be considered before treatment. The absence of KRAS mutations does not guarantee an improved likelihood of response to cetuximab and panitumumab. Investigation of other genetic and epigenetic biomarkers will be useful to further refine the responder population. Prospective studies to test the efficacy of combined therapies simultaneously targeting EGFR and the RAS/RAF/MAPK signalling pathways for mCRC are warranted."

BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction is a cardiomyopathy characterized by excessive trabeculation of the left ventricle, progressive myocardial dysfunction, and early mortality. Left ventricular noncompaction has a heterogeneous clinical presentation that includes arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed all children diagnosed with left ventricular noncompaction at Texas Children's Hospital from January 1990 to January 2009. Patients with congenital cardiac lesions were excluded. Two hundred forty-two children were diagnosed with isolated left ventricular noncompaction over the study period. Thirty-one (12.8%) died, and 13 (5.4%) were received a transplant. One hundred fifty (62%) presented with or developed cardiac dysfunction. The presence of cardiac dysfunction was strongly associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 11; P<0.001). ECG abnormalities were present in 87%, with ventricular hypertrophy and repolarization abnormalities occurring most commonly. Repolarization abnormalities were associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 2.1; P=0.02). Eighty children (33.1%) had an arrhythmia, and those with arrhythmias had increased mortality (hazard ratio, 2.8; P=0.002). Forty-two (17.4%) had ventricular tachycardia, with 5 presenting with resuscitated sudden cardiac death. In total, there were 15 cases of sudden cardiac death in the cohort (6.2%). Nearly all patients with sudden death (14 of 15) had abnormal cardiac dimensions or cardiac dysfunction. No patient with normal cardiac dimensions and function without preceding arrhythmias died. CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular noncompaction has a high mortality rate and is strongly associated with arrhythmias in children. Preceding cardiac dysfunction or ventricular arrhythmias are associated with increased mortality. Children with normal cardiac dimensions and normal function are at low risk for sudden death."

METHODS: A total of 798 Han Chinese patients received long-term warfarin anticoagulant therapy orally after valve replacement in our hospital between 2000 and 2008 were included in this study. Nine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci [rs12572351 G > A, rs9332146 G > A, rs4917639 G > T, rs1057910 A > C (CYP2C9(*)3), rs1934967 G > T, rs1934968 G > A, rs9923231 C > T (VKORC1-1639 G > A), rs2359612 G > A and rs10871454 C > T] in 2 genes including CYP2C9 and VKORC1, which were possibly correlated with warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics through literature retrieval, were selected and analyzed. Warfarin steady-state dose requirement, time to the INR (the international normalized ratio) within the therapeutic range and percent of the INR of more than 3.5 were compared among genotype subgroups. SNaPshot technique was used to detect gene SNPs; Hardy-Weinberg genetic equilibrium test was used to test population representativeness. RESULTS: CYP2C9(*)3 genotype did not affect the required warfarin dose while it was associated with increased risk of bleeding when treated with routine dosage regimen during the initiation of treatment. The allelic mutation frequency at VKORC1 gene rs10871454G > A and VKORC1-1639G > A SNP loci was 92.04% and 88.03%, respectively and rs10871454 was in perfect linkage disequilibrium with-1639. Patients with VKORC1 rs10871454 genetic mutation required lower warfarin dose in the first 28 days of therapy. VKORC1-1639 genetic polymorphism was also associated with shorter time to the INR within the therapeutic range and increased risk of over-anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Detecting genetic polymorphism of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 could guide clinical use of warfarin to reduce the risk of adverse reactions including bleeding in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy."

Activation of a large multisubunit protein kinase, called the inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, is central to the induction of the family of transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB. IKK is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and a regulatory IKKgamma subunit. It is known that the catalytic IKKbeta and regulatory IKKgamma subunits associate through interactions mediated by the N-terminal region of IKKgamma and an 11-mer peptide located near the C-terminus of IKKbeta. In this study, we have defined the minimal IKKgamma segment that binds IKKbeta and determined the binding affinity of the IKKbeta/IKKgamma complex. We identified that the N-terminal segment spanning residues 40-130 of IKKgamma binds the IKKbeta C-terminal domain (residues 665-756) with Kd approximately 25 nM. Several smaller N-terminal IKKgamma deletion mutants within the N-terminal 130 residues, although in some cases retained IKKbeta binding activity, showed a tendency to aggregate and formed covalently linked complexes. However, expansion of the C-terminus of these fragments to residue 210 completely changed the solution behavior of the IKKgamma N-terminus without affecting the IKKbeta binding affinity. We also found that the IKKbeta C-terminal domain formed a dimer in solution and the basic unit of the IKKbeta/IKKgamma complex was a dimer/dimer."

BACKGROUND: The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a common and clinically heterogeneous leukemia occurring in adults, remains poorly understood. METHODS: We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease. RESULTS: Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

The subjects increased their endurance capacity, VO2max (l min\u22121) by 17.4% (P < 0.001), and improved insulin sensitivity by 19% (P < 0.01). While myomiR expression remained stable during a hyperinsulinaemic - euglycaemic clamp, an acute bout of exercise increased mir-1 (P < 0.05) and mir-133a (P < 0.05) expression before, but not after, training. In resting biopsies, endurance training for 12 weeks decreased basal expression of all four myomiRs (P < 0.05). Interestingly, all myomiRs reverted to their pre-training expression levels 14 days after ceasing the training programme. Components of major pathways involved in endurance adaptation such as MAPK and TGF-\u03b2 were predicted to be targeted by the myomiRs examined. Tested predicted target proteins included Cdc42 and ERK 1/2. Although these proteins were downregulated between post-training period and 2 weeks of cessation, an inverse correlation between myomiR and target proteins was not found. In conclusion, our data suggest myomiRs respond to physiological stimuli, but their role in regulating human skeletal muscle adaptation remains unknown."

Trophectoderm biopsy may provide more cells for accurate diagnosis. However, the time allowed for transportation of the specimens to the laboratory and performance of molecular diagnosis is limited. We designed a PGD program of trophectoderm biopsy, vitrification of blastocysts, whole genome amplification (WGA), double confirmatory genotypings, and thawed embryo transfer. CASE REPORT: We conducted this strategy for a woman of familial neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1). She had a genotype of heterozygous c.6709C>T mutation of NF1 gene. Trophectoderm biopsies were performed on 13 blastocysts. Then, individual blastocyst was vitrified. WGA was performed for the samples, followed by genotypings with both real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Eight embryos were diagnosed as unaffected, four were affected, and one was inconclusive because of allele drop-out. In the next cycle, two unaffected blastocysts were thawed and transferred, that resulted in a singleton pregnancy. The pregnancy was confirmed as unaffected by means of chorionic villi sampling. CONCLUSION: We first demonstrate successful application of blastocyst biopsy, vitrification, WGA, and thawed embryo transfer for PGD of a monogenic disease. Vitrification of blastocysts after biopsy permits sufficient time for shipment of samples and operation of molecular diagnosis."

Chronic atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia affecting 2 to 4% of the population older than 60 years of age. Atrial fibrillation may cause disabling symptoms and serious adverse effects, such as impairment of cardiac function or thromboembolic events. It is also associated with an increased risk of death. In the past, the most common underlying heart disease related to chronic atrial fibrillation was rheumatic heart disease. Today, this disease occurs relatively rarely. Nevertheless, the incidence of atrial fibrillation is likely to increase in the future due to the aging of the population, since its prevalence increases with age. In most patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmia can be attributed to organic heart disease or metabolic disorders. In western countries ischemic and hypertensive heart disease (including sick sinus syndrome) and alcohol (holiday heart syndrome) are numerically more important than the classical causes of atrial fibrillation--rheumatic heart disease and thyrotoxicosis--which are declining in incidence. Overall, atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased mortality. In about 15% of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, no underlying cardiac or metabolic abnormality can be found, also the arrhythmia can itself give right to atrial dilatation. Atrial fibrillation consists most probably of several coexisting reentrant wave fronts of activation within the atria. Atrial activation and atrial fibrillation is as follows: multiple wavelets sweep round the atria in irregular, shifting patterns; completed reentrant circuits are the exception. Atrial flutter in its common form is characterized by evidence of atrial activity at a rate of 250-350 bpm, and usually almost exactly 300 bpm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

BACKGROUND: In the ARISTOTLE trial, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have a high risk of stroke. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in prespecified subgroups of patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. METHODS: Between Dec 19, 2006, and April 2, 2010, patients were enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial at 1034 clinical sites in 39 countries. 18,201 patients with AF or atrial flutter were randomly assigned to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2\u00b70-3\u00b70). The median duration of follow-up was 1\u00b78 years (IQR 1\u00b74-2\u00b73). The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, analysed by intention to treat. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding in the on-treatment population. All participants, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignments. In this subgroup analysis, we estimated event rates and used Cox models to compare outcomes in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. The ARISTOTLE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC00412984. FINDINGS: Of the trial population, 3436 (19%) had a previous stroke or TIA. In the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 2\u00b746 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the apixaban group and 3\u00b724 in the warfarin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b776, 95% CI 0\u00b756 to 1\u00b703); in the subgroup of patients without previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1\u00b701 per 100 patient-years of follow-up with apixaban and 1\u00b723 with warfarin (HR 0\u00b782, 95% CI 0\u00b765 to 1\u00b703; p for interaction=0\u00b771). The absolute reduction in the rate of stroke and systemic embolism with apixaban versus warfarin was 0\u00b777 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI -0\u00b708 to 1\u00b763) in patients with and 0\u00b722 (-0\u00b703 to 0\u00b747) in those without previous stroke or TIA. The difference in major bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin was 1\u00b707 per 100 patient-years (95% CI 0\u00b709-2\u00b704) in patients with and 0\u00b793 (0\u00b754-1\u00b732) in those without previous stroke or TIA. INTERPRETATION: The effects of apixaban versus warfarin were consistent in patients with AF with and without previous stroke or TIA. Owing to the higher risk of these outcomes in patients with previous stroke or TIA, the absolute benefits of apixaban might be greater in this population. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer."

The pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) is formed at all potential origins of replication through the action of the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm2-7 complex. The end result of pre-RC formation is the loading of the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase onto origin DNA. We examined pre-RC formation in vitro and found that it proceeds through separable binding events. Origin-bound ORC recruits Cdc6, and this ternary complex then promotes helicase loading in the presence of a pre-formed Mcm2-7-Cdt1 complex. Using a stepwise pre-RC assembly assay, we investigated the fate of pre-RC components during later stages of the reaction. We determined that helicase loading is accompanied by dissociation of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 from origin DNA. This dissociation requires ATP hydrolysis at a late stage of pre-RC assembly. Our results indicate that pre-RC formation is a dynamic process."

Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in almost all adrenal medullary cells of the adult chicken. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase IR coincided with that of TH. Many medullary cells also exhibited PNMT IR, but PNMT-immunonegative cells were also observed. Tyrosine hydroxylase IR was localized in the E- and NE-containing cells, but PNMT IR was localized only in the E-containing cells. Approximately 69% of medullary cells were E-containing, and the remaining were NE-containing cells. The ratio of E- and NE-containing cells between the subcapsular and central zone was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Although cortical cells of the adrenal gland did not show TH-, DBH-, or PNMT-positive reactions, ganglia close to the adrenal gland showed TH, DBH, and PNMT immunoreactivities. These findings indicated the cellular localization of 3 catecholamine-biosynthesizing enzymes in chicken adrenal medulla and suggest that the majority of medullary cell are E-containing cells. The ratio of E cells to NE cells varies among the 3 zones in the adrenal glands of the chicken."

Binding pose prediction has been improved compared to the earlier version by the efficient generation of high-quality initial conformations for CSA using a predocking method based on a beta-complex derived from the Voronoi diagram of receptor atoms. Binding affinity prediction has also been enhanced by using the optimal combination of energy components, while taking into consideration the energy of the unbound ligand state. The new version has been tested in terms of binding mode prediction, binding affinity prediction, and virtual screening on several benchmark sets, showing improved performance over the previous version and AutoDock, on which the GalaxyDock energy function is based.

In this paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of CUTs. In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation. Dissection of a CUT terminator reveals a minimal element sufficient for Nrd1- and Nab3-directed termination. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome."

Our data demonstrate that Sod1 transfected cell lines that have an elevation in the ratio of Sod1 activity to Gpx1 activity produce higher levels of H2O2 and exhibit well characterised markers of cellular senescence viz. slower proliferation and altered morphology. On the contrary, Sod1 transfected cell lines that have an unaltered ratio in the activity of these two enzymes, have unaltered levels of H2O2 and fail to show characteristics of senescence. Furthermore, fibroblasts established from individuals with Down syndrome have an increase in the ratio of Sod1 to Gpx1 activity compared with corresponding controls and senesce earlier. Interestingly, cells treated with H2O2 also show features of senescence and/or senesce earlier. We also show that Cip1 mRNA levels are elevated in Down syndrome cells, Sod1 transfectants with an altered Sod1 to Gpx1 activity ratio and those treated with H2O2, thus suggesting that the slow proliferation may be mediated by Cip1. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that Cip1 mRNA levels are induced by exposure of cells to H2O2. These data give valuable insight into possible molecular mechanisms that contribute tribute to cellular senescence and may be useful in the evolution of therapeutic strategies for aging."

Here, we show that the prolyl isomerase Ess1 is required for Nrd1-dependent termination of noncoding RNAs. Ess1 binds the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II and is thought to regulate transcription by conformational isomerization of Ser-Pro bonds within the CTD. In ess1 mutants, expression of approximately 10% of the genome was altered, due primarily to defects in termination of snoRNAs, CUTs, stable unannotated transcripts, and uRNAs. Ess1 promoted dephosphorylation of Ser5 (but not Ser2) within the CTD, most likely by the Ssu72 phosphatase. We also provide evidence for a competition between Nrd1 and Pcf11 for CTD binding that is regulated by Ess1. These data indicate that a prolyl isomerase is required for specifying the \"CTD code.\""

The mTORC1 protein kinase complex consists of mTOR, raptor, mLST8/GbetaL and PRAS40. Previously, we reported that mTOR plays an important role in regulating protein synthesis in response to alcohol (EtOH). However, the mechanisms by which EtOH regulates mTORC1 activity have not been established. Here, we investigated the effect of EtOH on the phosphorylation and interaction of components of mTORC1 in C2C12 myocytes. We also examined the specific role that PRAS40 plays in this process. Incubation of myocytes with EtOH (100 mM, 24 h) increased raptor and PRAS40 phosphorylation. Likewise, there were increased levels of the PRAS40 upstream regulators Akt and IRS-1. EtOH also caused changes in mTORC1 protein-protein interactions. EtOH enhanced the binding of raptor and PRAS40 with mTOR. These alterations occurred in concert with increased binding of 14-3-3 to raptor, while the PRAS40 and 14-3-3 interaction was not affected. The shRNA knockdown (KD) of PRAS40 decreased protein synthesis similarly to EtOH. PRAS40 KD increased raptor phosphorylation and its association with 14-3-3, whereas decreased GbetaL-mTOR binding. The effects of EtOH and PRAS40 KD were mediated by AMPK. Both factors increased in vitro AMPK activity towards the substrate raptor. In addition, KD enhanced the activity of AMPK towards TSC2. Collectively, our results indicate that EtOH stabilizes the association of raptor, PRAS40, and GbetaL with mTOR, while likewise increasing the interaction of raptor with 14-3-3. These data suggest a possible mechanism for the inhibitory effects of EtOH on mTOR kinase activity and protein synthesis in myocytes."

They are present in unicellular eukaryotes and in this study, the role of the BET protein Bdf1 has been explored in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutation of Bdf1 bromodomains revealed defects on both the formation of spores and the meiotic progression, blocking cells at the exit from prophase, before the first meiotic division. This phenotype is associated with a massive deregulation of the transcription of meiotic genes and Bdf1 bromodomains are required for appropriate expression of the key meiotic transcription factor NDT80 and almost all the Ndt80-inducible genes, including APC complex components. Bdf1 notably accumulates on the promoter of Ndt80 and its recruitment is dependent on Bdf1 bromodomains. In addition, the ectopic expression of NDT80 during meiosis partially bypasses this dependency. Finally, purification of Bdf1 partners identified two independent complexes with Bdf2 or the SWR complex, neither of which was required to complete sporulation. Taken together, our results unveil a new role for Bdf1 -working independently from its predominant protein partners Bdf2 and the SWR1 complex-as a regulator of meiosis-specific genes."

A total of 28 genetically unrelated Enterobacteriaceae strains producing several class A carbapenemases were tested. Thirty-eight genetically unrelated negative controls were included. The isolates were tested against imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), and ertapenem (ETP) by MIC and disk diffusion assays in order to select appropriate tools to screen for suspected carbapenemase production. It was possible to differentiate class A carbapenemase-producing bacteria from non-carbapenemase-producing bacteria by using solely the routine IPM susceptibility tests. The modified Hodge test was evaluated and found to be highly sensitive, although false-positive results were documented. Novel BA-based methods (a double-disk synergy test and combined-disk and MIC tests) using IPM, MEM, and ETP, in combination with 3-aminophenylboronic acid as an inhibitor, were designed as confirmatory tools. On the basis of the performance of these methods, a sensitive flow chart for suspicion and confirmation of class A carbapenemase production in species of Enterobacteriaceae was designed. By using this methodology, isolates producing KPC, GES, Sme, IMI, and NMC-A carbapenemases were successfully distinguished from those producing other classes of beta-lactamases (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpCs, and metallo-beta-lactamases, etc).

We have investigated the possibility that calsequestrin is a luminal calcium concentration sensor for the ryanodine receptor. We measured the luminal calcium concentration at which calsequestrin dissociates from the ryanodine receptor and the effect of calsequestrin on the response of the ryanodine receptor to changes in luminal calcium. We provide electrophysiological and biochemical evidence that: 1), luminal calcium concentration of >/=4 mM dissociates calsequestrin from junctional face membrane, whereas in the range of 1-3 mM calsequestrin remains attached; 2), the association with calsequestrin inhibits ryanodine receptor activity, but amplifies its response to changes in luminal calcium concentration; and 3), under physiological calcium conditions (1 mM), phosphorylation of calsequestrin does not alter its ability to inhibit native ryanodine receptor activity when the anchoring proteins triadin and junctin are present. These data suggest that the quaternary complex is intact in vivo, and provides further evidence that calsequestrin is involved in the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling pathway and has a role as a luminal calcium sensor for the ryanodine receptor."

These probably form through a common mechanism and have been termed \"class 1.\" Collectively, rare ROBs also occur mostly during oogenesis (7/10) but probably arise through a more \"random\" mechanism or a variety of mechanisms and have been termed \"class 2.\" Thus, we demonstrate that although both classes of ROBs occur predominantly during meiosis, the common, class 1 ROBs occur primarily during oogenesis and likely form through a mechanism distinct from that forming class 2 ROBs."

Wernicke's encephalopathy is a serious neurologic disorder caused by vitamin-B1 or thiamine deficiency. The classical triad of clinical symptoms described by Wernicke (gait ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion) are found in only a third of patients upon initial examination. Typical findings upon MR imaging in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy are well documented, with signal intensities in the medial thalami and periaqueductal regions of the midbrain. We report a case of Wernicke's encephalopathy revealing an unusual contrast enhancement. It is therefore important to note that the acute stage of Wernicke's encephalopathy may be associated with an intense contrast enhancement upon MR-imaging reflecting the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and inflammatory processes caused by thiamine deficiency. As a consequence from the guideline for managing Wernicke's encephalopathy by the Royal College of Physicians early B-vitamin treatment in suspected is recommended cases."

The search for the etiologic agents of periodontal diseases started in the Golden Era of medical bacteriology, when the etiologic agents of many bacterial infections were isolated and characterized. After the initial enthusiasm in establishing the infectious nature and the true agents of periodontal diseases, this concept was virtually ignored for the next four decades. Until the early 1970s treatment regimens based on the non-specific plaque hypothesis were directed towards a non-specific reduction in plaque amount. Later, the specific plaque hypothesis established the role of some microorganisms such as A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, T. denticola, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in different forms of periodontal diseases. It was recently suggested that these suspected periodontal pathogens seem to not act alone and interactions between species, especially the balance between pathogenic and beneficial species affect both progression of disease and response of tissues to periodontal therapy. Nowadays it is well established that one of the goals of therapy is to control such periodontal pathogens. Among the most commonly used therapies to treat periodontal infections are scaling and root planing (SRP), supragingival plaque control and periodontal surgeries. Many studies confirmed the reduction of \"red complex\" species by SRP, and apically repositioned flap can lead to an additional beneficial effect in the subgingival microbiota by decreasing levels of \"red\" and \"orange complexes\" species. Furthermore, the level of plaque control maintained by the patients has been considered a crucial step in preventing recurrence of destructive periodontitis."

OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively ascertain the extent and severity of clinical features in affected individuals from 2 large families with proven heterozygous mutations in the CYLD locus and to correlate these findings with the 3 appendageal tumor predisposition syndromes (familial cylindromatosis, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, and multiple familial trichoepitheliomas) known to be associated with such germline mutations. DESIGN: Interfamilial and intrafamilial observational study. SETTING: Tertiary genetic and dermatology referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four individuals recruited from 2 large multigenerational families with CYLD mutations. Clinical details, history, and tumor maps were obtained from all participants; in 18, the information was corroborated by detailed clinical examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor density, distribution and histologic findings, associated medical conditions, patient symptoms, and impact of disease on quality of life. RESULTS: The severity of penetrance and phenotype varied within families. Although an approximately equal female to male predisposition was noted, 5 women and 1 man (of 26 patients surveyed [23%]) had undergone total scalp removal. The average age at onset was 16 years (range, 8-30 years). Symptoms reported by affected patients included painful tumors (in 12 of 23 patients [52%] who answered the question), conductive deafness, and sexual dysfunction. Of the 26 surveyed patients, tumors were noted on the scalp in 21 (81%), on the trunk in 18 (69%), and in the pubic area in 11 (42%). Tumor mapping provided clinical evidence that correlated with hormonally stimulated hair follicles being particularly vulnerable to loss of heterozygosity and tumor induction. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease at sites other than the head and neck appears to be underreported in the literature and greatly affects quality of life. Differentiation between the clinical diagnoses has little prognostic or clinical utility in genetic counseling, even within individuals from the same family. Thus, we suggest an encompassing diagnosis of \"CYLD cutaneous syndrome.\" Finally, the clinical distribution of tumors suggests that hormonal factors may play an important role in tumor induction in these patients."

We show here that dimers of native gp210 can be isolated from cell extracts by immunoprecipitation, and from purified rat liver nuclear envelopes by velocity sedimentation and gel filtration. Cross-linking of proteins in isolated membranes prior to solubilization dramatically increases the proportion of dimers. The dimers are SDS-resistant, as previously observed for some integral membrane proteins of cis-Golgi and plasma membrane proteins, including glycophorin A. Larger oligomers of gp210 can also be obtained by gel filtration and denaturing electrophoresis, but unlike the dimers are dissociated by reduction and heating in the presence of SDS. We propose that gp210 is organized into the pore membrane as a large array of gp210 dimers that may constitute a luminal submembranous protein skeleton."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received pembrolizumab 10\u00a0mg/kg every 2 (Q2W) or every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 2 years, or four cycles of ipilimumab 3\u00a0mg/kg Q3W. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was administered at baseline and throughout the study. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) analyses were pre-specified exploratory endpoints; the primary PRO assessment was the score change from baseline to week 12 in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (GHS)/HRQoL score between the arms using constrained longitudinal data analysis. RESULTS: The PRO analysis population included 776 patients: pembrolizumab Q2W (n\u00a0=\u00a0270); pembrolizumab Q3W (n\u00a0=\u00a0266); ipilimumab (n\u00a0=\u00a0240).

QLQ-C30 compliance rates at week 12 were 87% (n\u00a0=\u00a0214), 97% (n\u00a0=\u00a0226),\u00a0and 96% (n\u00a0=\u00a0178), for the pembrolizumab Q2W, pembrolizumab Q3W, and ipilimumab arms, respectively. From baseline to week 12, GHS/HRQoL scores were better maintained with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab (decrease of -1.9 and -2.5 for pembrolizumab versus -10.0 for ipilimumab; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for each pembrolizumab arm versus ipilimumab). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced deterioration in GHS at week 12 (31% for pembrolizumab Q2W; 29% for Q3W and 44% for ipilimumab), with similar trends observed for individual functioning and symptoms scales.

The post-translational citrullination (deimination) process is mediated by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), which convert peptidylarginine into peptidylcitrulline in the presence of high calcium concentrations. Over the past decade, PADs and protein citrullination have been commonly implicated as abnormal pathological features in neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses associated with diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Based on this evidence, we investigated the roles of PADs and citrullination in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are pathologically well characterized as the accumulation of disease-associated misfolded prion proteins, spongiform changes, glial cell activation and neuronal loss. We previously demonstrated that the upregulation of PAD2, mainly found in reactive astrocytes of infected brains, leads to excessive citrullination, which is correlated with disease progression. Further, we demonstrated that various cytoskeletal and energy metabolism-associated proteins are particularly vulnerable to citrullination. Our recent in vivo and in vitro studies elicited altered functions of enolase as the result of citrullination; these altered functions included reduced enzyme activity, increased protease sensitivity and enhanced plasminogen-binding affinity. These findings suggest that PAD2 and citrullinated proteins may play a key role in the brain pathology of prion diseases. By extension, we believe that abnormal increases in protein citrullination may be strong evidence of neurodegeneration."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the tolerability of two different dose-initiation regimens of gabapentin for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures. BACKGROUND: Patient compliance is a key feature of successful outpatient pharmacologic therapy for epilepsy, and one aspect of compliance is simplicity of initiation. By using a rapid titration rate, leading to a rapid therapeutic gabapentin dose, perhaps there could be an improvement with compliance. METHODS: Male or female patients, at least 12 years old, with a recent history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, were randomized to receive gabapentin (following a blinded placebo period of an undisclosed number of days) as either a Slow initiation (300 mg day 1, 600 mg day 2, then 900 mg/day) or a Rapid initiation (900 mg/day immediately following the placebo lead-in). RESULTS: Starting gabapentin therapy at an initial therapeutic dosage of 900 mg/day is well tolerated by patients with epilepsy and is as safe as initiating with a titration schedule over 3 days. Of the four most common adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue), only one, dizziness, occurred more often in the nontitrated (Rapid initiation) group than in the titrated (Slow initiation) group. CONCLUSION: Initiation of gabapentin at 900 mg/day is as well tolerated as is a 3-day titration, except for a higher incidence of dizziness."

We have described the application of a simple biotinylation tagging approach for the direct purification of tagged transcription factor complexes, based on the use of artificial short peptide tags that are specifically and efficiently biotinylated by the bacterial BirA biotin ligase, which is co-expressed in cells with the tagged factor. We used this approach to initially characterize complexes formed by the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 in erythroid cells. GATA-1 is essential for the erythroid differentiation, its functions encompassing upregulation of erythroid genes, repression of alternative transcription programs, and suppression of cell proliferation. However, it was not clear how all of these GATA-1 functions are mediated. Our work describes, for the first time, distinct GATA-1 interactions with the essential hematopoietic factor Gfi-1b, the repressive MeCP1 complex, and the chromatin remodeling ACF/WCRF complex, in addition to the known GATA-1/FOG-1 and GATA-1/TAL-1 complexes. We also provide evidence that distinct GATA-1 complexes are associated with specific GATA-1 functions in erythroid differentiation, for example, GATA-1/Gfi-1b with the suppression of cell proliferation and GATA-1/FOG-1/MeCP1 with the repression of other hematopoietic transcription programs. We next applied the biotinylation tag to Ldb-1, a known partner of GATA-1, and characterized a number of novel interaction partners that are essential in erythroid development, in particular, Eto-2, Lmo4, and CdK9. Last, we are in the process of applying the same technology to characterize the factors that are bound to the suppressed gamma-globin promoter in vivo."

This compartment localizes into three main regions: the peripheral heterochromatin, perinucleolar heterochromatin, and pericentromeric heterochromatin. Both chromatin remodeling proteins and transcription of noncoding RNAs are involved in maintenance of repression in these compartments. Global reorganization of the repressive compartment occurs at each cell division, during early development, and during terminal differentiation.

However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes.

However, we have previously shown that 3' exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) are marked by high levels of H3K9me3. We have now further investigated this unusual location for H3K9me3 in ZNF genes. Neither bioinformatic nor experimental approaches support the hypothesis that the 3' exons of ZNFs are promoters. We further characterized the histone modifications at the 3' ZNF exons and found that these regions also contain H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation. A genome-wide analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed that ZNFs constitute the majority of genes that have high levels of both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. These results suggested the possibility that the ZNF genes may be imprinted, with one allele transcribed and one allele repressed. To test the hypothesis that the contradictory modifications are due to imprinting, we used a SNP analysis of RNA-seq data to demonstrate that both alleles of certain ZNF genes having H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 are transcribed. We next analyzed isolated ZNF 3' exons using stably integrated episomes. We found that although the H3K36me3 mark was lost when the 3' ZNF exon was removed from its natural genomic location, the isolated ZNF 3' exons retained the H3K9me3 mark. Thus, the H3K9me3 mark at ZNF 3' exons does not impede transcription and it is regulated independently of the H3K36me3 mark. Finally, we demonstrate a strong relationship between the number of tandemly repeated domains in the 3' exons and the H3K9me3 mark. We suggest that the H3K9me3 at ZNF 3' exons may function to protect the genome from inappropriate recombination rather than to regulate transcription."

This is the largest recorded series concerning conjoined twins; data were analyzed on 7,903,000 births monitored by the BDMP in the period 1970-1977. The analysis identified 81 sets of conjoined twins, for a crude incidence of 10.25 per million births. The most common types of conjoined twins were thoracoomphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%), and craniopagus (6%). Conjoined twins are more common among females than males, and in nonwhites than whites. No maternal age effect was found. There was no evidence of seasonal or temporal clustering of the cases. The large number of conjoined twins who had birth defects that are not obviously linked to the conjoining (particularly neural tube defects and orofacial clefts) may provide insights into the pathogenesis of birth defects resulting from disordered embryonic migration and fusion."

In the present study, using mutation screening of the NF1 gene, mapping of chromosome aberrations by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, microarray-based expression profiling and immunohistochemistry (IHC), we addressed the implication of NF1 somatic alterations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We studied 53 sporadic tumors, selected because of their classification with RET/NF1/TMEM127-related tumors by genome wide expression studies, as well as a second set of 11 independent tumors selected on their low individual levels of NF1 expression evaluated by microarray. Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases. Gene expression signature of NF1-related tumors highlighted the downregulation of NF1 and the major overexpression of SOX9. Among the second set of 11 tumors, two sporadic tumors carried somatic mutations in NF1 as well as in another susceptibility gene. These new findings suggest that NF1 loss of function is a frequent event in the tumorigenesis of sporadic pheochromocytoma and strengthen the new concept of molecular-based targeted therapy for pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma."

The overall response rates were comparable between FEC 50 (44.6%) and FEC 75 (44.7%), but both were better than the epirubicin alone (30.6%) (P = .04 and P = .0006, respectively). The complete response rate was better in FEC 75 (15.5%) than in FEC 50 (7%) (P = .025) or epirubicin (4%) (P = .002). Similar results were obtained in the group of patients without bone-only metastases. No difference in the three treatments was observed in the patients with bone metastases only. Mean durations of response were similar in the three groups, being 412 days, 440 days, and 350 days for FEC 50, FEC 75, and epirubicin, respectively. Patients without previous adjuvant chemotherapy fared better than those with previous treatment (without anthracyclines). Tolerability was fair in the three groups. Overall, the epirubicin-alone group showed better tolerance than the two other groups, which did not differ significantly. Time to progression and survival were not different among the three groups, but more early relapses occurred in the epirubicin and FEC 50 groups; survival seemed to be better during the first 8 months in the FEC 75 group, and the survival difference between the epirubicin group and the FEC 75 group was of borderline significance.

In malignancies, these signaling pathways are often exploited to optimize tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, they represent attractive targets for cancer therapy. This review will summarize current knowledge of the small-molecule multiple-kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. These inhibitors generally hinder the phosphorylation of several protein kinases of membrane receptors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, and cytoplasmic receptors such as c-Kit, Raf kinase, and FLT3.

The original hedgehog (hh) gene was found in Drosophila and named for the appearance of a mutant phenotype which causes an embryo to be covered with pointy denticles, thus resembling a hedgehog. The hedgehog family consists of sonic hedgehog (Shh), desert hedgehog (Dhh), and Indian hedgehog (Ihh). Shh is found in vertebrates and the best studied ligand of the hedgehog signaling pathway (Gilbert, 2000). It plays an important role in regulating vertebrate organogenesis, such as in the growth of digits on limbs and organization of the brain, and earlier studies also show that it is important during retinal development (for a review, see Amato et al., 2004). Hedgehog expression drives waves of neurogenesis in animal retina, although genetic programs that control its expression are poorly elucidated. Recently, a novel transcriptional cascade which involves the atonal and Iroquois gene family was proposed in the regulation of hedgehog waves during vertebrate retinal development (Choy et al., 2010). This chapter will focus on Shh by addressing its signaling mechanisms and roles in vertebrate eye development, as well as a novel finding in retinogenesis."

Domains of application of these analyses are diverse: identification of evolutionary events, inference of gene functions, detection of niche-specific genes or phylogenetic profiling. Insyght is a comparative genomic visualization tool that combines three complementary displays: (i) a table for thoroughly browsing amongst homologues, (ii) a comparator of orthologue functional annotations and (iii) a genomic organization view designed to improve the legibility of rearrangements and distinctive loci. The latter display combines symbolic and proportional graphical paradigms. Synchronized navigation across multiple species and interoperability between the views are core features of Insyght. A gene filter mechanism is provided that helps the user to build a biologically relevant gene set according to multiple criteria such as presence/absence of homologues and/or various annotations. We illustrate the use of Insyght with scenarios. Currently, only Bacteria and Archaea are supported. A public instance is available at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/Insyght.

Corneal ganzfeld ERGs were elicited in response to flash stimuli of strengths of 0.001 - 10 phot cd s/m2 presented scotopically, and 0.3 - 10 phot cd s/m2 presented photopically. ERG waveforms from light-adapted retinae of all patients showed reduced amplitudes of the photopic negative response (PhNR) (P < 0.001). The photopic ERGs showed a delay in b-wave time to peak, but the photopic hill, i.e. the relative variation of time to peak and amplitude with luminance flash strength, was preserved. Scotopic ERGs to flash strengths 0.01 to 0.1 phot cd s/m2 showed a delay of up to 20 ms before the onset of the b-wave in two patients compared to controls. Stimulus - response functions were fitted by Michaelis - Menten equations and showed significantly lower retinal sensitivity in two patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Our study for the first time in the human ERG shows changes in association with KCNJ10 mutations affecting a Muller cell K+ channel.

          "context": "Moyamoya disease: a summary. Moyamoya, meaning a \"hazy puff of smoke\" in Japanese, is a chronic, occlusive cerebrovascular disease involving bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and/or the proximal portions of the anterior cerebral arteries and middle cerebral arteries (MCAs). The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan has defined 4 types of moyamoya disease (MMD): ischemic, hemorrhagic, epileptic, and \"other.\" The ischemic type has been shown to predominate in childhood, while the hemorrhagic type is more often observed in the adult population. The highest prevalence of MMD is found in Japan, with a higher female to male ratio. Studies have shown a possible genetic association of MMD linked to chromosome 17 in Japanese cases as well as in cases found in other demographics. During autopsy, intracerebral hematoma is found and most commonly serves as the major cause of death in patients with MMD. Moyamoya vessels at the base of the brain are composed of medium-sized or small muscular arteries emanating from the circle of Willis, mainly the intracranial portions of ICAs, anterior choroidal arteries, and posterior cerebral arteries, forming complex channels that connect with distal positions of the MCAs. Off of these channels are small tortuous and dilated vessels that penetrate into the base of the brain at the site of the thalamoperforate and lenticulostriate arteries. On angiography, there is the characteristic stenosis or occlusion bilaterally at the terminal portion of the ICAs as well as the moyamoya vessels at the base of the brain. Six angiographic stages have been described, from Stage 1, which reveals a narrowing of the carotid forks, to Stage 6, in which the moyamoya vessels disappear and collateral circulation is produced solely from the external carotid arteries. Cases with milder symptoms are usually treated conservatively; however, more severe symptomatic cases are treated using revascularization procedures. Surgical treatments are divided into 3 types: direct, indirect, and combined/other methods. Direct bypass includes superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass or use of other graft types. Indirect procedures bring in circulation to the intracranial regions by introducing newly developed vasculature from newly approximated tissues. These procedures may not be enough to prevent further ischemia; therefore, a combination of direct and indirect procedures is more suitable. This article will give a review of the epidemiology, natural history, pathology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria, including imaging, and briefly describe the surgical treatment of MMD."

High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) promises simultaneous transcript discovery and abundance estimation. However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed >430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation."

          "context": "JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes. Genomic DNA of African trypanosomes contains a hypermodified thymidine residue termed base J (beta-d-glucosyl-HOMedU). This modified base is localized primarily to repetitive DNA, namely the telomeres, and is implicated in the regulation of antigenic variation. The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway. Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH). This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J. Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. We have previously shown that mutations in the TH domain of JBP1 kill its ability to stimulate J synthesis. Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis. While the individual JBP1 null and JBP2 null trypanosomes have reduced J levels, the deletion of both JBP1 and JBP2 generates a cell line that completely lacks base J but still contains glucosyl-transferase activity. Reintroduction of JBP2 in the J-null trypanosome stimulates HOMedU formation and site-specific synthesis of base J. We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis."

Transient overexpression of defined combinations of master regulator genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming: the acquisition of an alternative predicted phenotype from a differentiated cell lineage. This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. In particular, combinations of five or seven transcription factors enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell culture conditions and was enhanced by the addition of valproic acid and JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca(2+) transient oscillations in the reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming, contributing to the ongoing rational design of a robust protocol required for cardiac regenerative therapies."

BACKGROUND: Methods to assess impaired consciousness in acute stroke typically include the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), but the verbal component has limitations in aphasic or intubated patients. The FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score, a new coma scale, evaluates 4 components: eye and motor responses, brainstem reflexes and respiration. We aimed to study the interobserver variability of the FOUR score in acute stroke patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with acute stroke admitted from February to July 2008 to the stroke unit of our Neurology Department. Patients were evaluated by neurology residents and nurses using the FOUR score and the GCS. For both scales, we obtained paired and total weighted kappa values (Kw) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). NIH stroke scale was also recorded on admission. RESULTS: We obtained a total of 75 paired evaluations in 60 patients (41 cerebral infarctions, 15 cerebral hemorrhages and 4 transient ischemic attacks). Thirty-three (55%) patients were alert, 17 (28.3%) drowsy and 10 (16.7%) stuporous or comatose. The overall rater agreement was excellent in the FOUR score (Kw 0.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.97) with an ICC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96) and in the GCS (Kw 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98) with an ICC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.97). A good correlation was found between the FOUR score and the GCS (rho 0.83; p < 0.01) and between the FOUR score and the NIH stroke scale (rho -0.78; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The FOUR score is a reliable scale for evaluating the level of consciousness in acute stroke patients, showing a good correlation with the GCS and the NIH stroke scale."

Agents Chemother. 39, 714-719]. Here, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursors. In vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction of Bacillus megaterium KM demonstrated that mersacidin did not prevent the synthesis of lipid II [undecaprenyl-diphosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-(pentapeptide)-N-ac ety lglucosamine] but specifically the subsequent conversion of this intermediate into polymeric nascent glycan strands by transglycosylation. Comparison with other inhibitors of transglycosylation shows that the effective concentration of mersacidin in vitro is in the range of that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin but 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the competitive enzyme inhibitor moenomycin. The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. This indicates that the molecular target site of mersacidin differs from that of vancomycin and that no cross-resistance exists between the two antibiotics."

AIM: ATP-sensitive potassium channels are important regulators of insulin secretion. They consist of four sulphonylurea receptor (encoded by ABCC8) and four inwardly rectifying protein (encoded by KCNJ11) subunits. Activating ABCC8 mutations lead to decreased insulin secretion and to diabetes. Wide phenotype variability is associated with single ABCC8 mutations, ranging from transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (ND) with or without developmental delay (DEND syndrome) to very mild phenotypes. This report describes the case of a Caucasian infant diagnosed with ND at the age of 2 months due to a novel ABCC8 missense mutation. METHODS: ABCC8 was analyzed by sequence analysis. The mutation was present in the patient and her family and was found to be associated with phenotypes ranging from ND to asymptomatic impaired fasting glucose (IFG). RESULTS: A novel His863Tyr ABCC8 mutation was identified in a 2-month-old girl diagnosed with ND. After an initial insulin treatment, treatment with glibenclamide was initiated and the treatment with insulin discontinued. The same mutation was found in her father, who had been fortuitously diagnosed with diabetes and had an HbA(1c) level of 9% (74.8 mmol/mol). The patient's brother and mother both had normal fasting glucose, and were not found to be carriers of the mutation. However, the same mutation was found in her grandmother, who had been asymptomatic and discovered IFG (6.9 mmol/L) with an HbA(1c) of 6.8% (50.8 mmol/mol). CONCLUSION: This case describes a novel ABCC8 mutation and offers a further illustration of the highly variable phenotypes associated with an identical mutation present across three generations."

The characteristic lesions of moyamoya disease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the causative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2. METHODS: To determine whether a gene related to moyamoya disease is located on chromosome 17, we conducted microsatellite linkage analyses on 24 families containing 56 patients with moyamoya disease. Leukocyte DNA extracted from the family members was subjected to polymerase chain reaction for a total of 22 microsatellite markers on chromosome 17. The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragments were analyzed with GeneScan on an automated sequencer. RESULTS: Two-point linkage analysis gave a maximum log(10) odds (LOD) score of 3.11 at the recombination fraction of 0.00 for the marker at locus D17S939. The affected pedigree member method also showed a significantly low P value (<1. 0x10(-5)) for the 5 adjacent markers at 17q25. Multipoint linkage analysis also indicated that the disease gene is contained within the 9-cM region of D17S785 to D17S836, with a maximum LOD score of 4. 58.

Aspergillus niger has an extraordinary potential to produce organic acids as proven by its application in industrial citric acid production. Previously, it was shown that expression of the cis-aconitate decarboxylase gene (cadA) from Aspergillus terreus converted A. niger into an itaconic acid producer (Li et al., Fungal Genet Bio 48: 602-611, 2011). After some initial steps in production optimization in the previous research (Li et al., BMC biotechnol 12: 57, 2012), this research aims at modifying host strains and fermentation conditions to further improve itaconic acid production. Expression of two previously identified A. terreus genes encoding putative organic acid transporters (mttA, mfsA) increased itaconic acid production in an A. niger cis-aconitate decarboxylase expressing strain. Surprisingly, the production did not increase further when both transporters were expressed together. Meanwhile, oxalic acid was accumulated as a by-product in the culture of mfsA transformants. In order to further increase itaconic acid production and eliminate by-product formation, the non-acidifying strain D15#26 and the oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase (oahA) deletion strain AB 1.13 \u2206oahA #76 have been analyzed for itaconic acid production. Whereas cadA expression in AB 1.13 \u2206oahA #76 resulted in higher itaconic acid production than strain CAD 10.1, this was not the case in strain D15#26. As expected, oxalic acid production was eliminated in both strains. In a further attempt to increase itaconic acid levels, an improved basal citric acid-producing strain, N201, was used for cadA expression. A selected transformant (N201CAD) produced more itaconic acid than strain CAD 10.1, derived from A. niger strain AB1.13. Subsequently, we have focused on the influence of dissolved oxygen (D.O.) on itaconic acid production. Interestingly, reduced D.O. levels (10-25 %) increased itaconic acid production using strain N201 CAD. Similar results were obtained in strain AB 1.13 CAD + HBD2.5 (HBD 2.5) which overexpressed a fungal hemoglobin domain. Our results showed that overexpression of the hemoglobin domain increased itaconic acid production in A. niger at lower D.O. levels. Evidently, the lower levels of D.O. have a positive influence on itaconic acid production in A. niger strains."

BACKGROUND: Deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation, and seizures (DOORS) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of unknown cause. We aimed to identify the genetic basis of this syndrome by sequencing most coding exons in affected individuals. METHODS: Through a search of available case studies and communication with collaborators, we identified families that included at least one individual with at least three of the five main features of the DOORS syndrome: deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures. Participants were recruited from 26 centres in 17 countries. Families described in this study were enrolled between Dec 1, 2010, and March 1, 2013. Collaborating physicians enrolling participants obtained clinical information and DNA samples from the affected child and both parents if possible. We did whole-exome sequencing in affected individuals as they were enrolled, until we identified a candidate gene, and Sanger sequencing to confirm mutations. We did expression studies in human fibroblasts from one individual by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, and in mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. FINDINGS: 26 families were included in the study. We did exome sequencing in the first 17 enrolled families; we screened for TBC1D24 by Sanger sequencing in subsequent families. We identified TBC1D24 mutations in 11 individuals from nine families (by exome sequencing in seven families, and Sanger sequencing in two families). 18 families had individuals with all five main features of DOORS syndrome, and TBC1D24 mutations were identified in half of these families. The seizure types in individuals with TBC1D24 mutations included generalised tonic-clonic, complex partial, focal clonic, and infantile spasms. Of the 18 individuals with DOORS syndrome from 17 families without TBC1D24 mutations, eight did not have seizures and three did not have deafness. In expression studies, some mutations abrogated TBC1D24 mRNA stability. We also detected Tbc1d24 expression in mouse phalangeal chondrocytes and calvaria, which suggests a role of TBC1D24 in skeletogenesis. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that mutations in TBC1D24 seem to be an important cause of DOORS syndrome and can cause diverse phenotypes. Thus, individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness and seizures but with the other features should still be screened for TBC1D24 mutations. More information is needed to understand the cellular roles of TBC1D24 and identify the genes responsible for DOORS phenotypes in individuals who do not have a mutation in TBC1D24.

Descriptive statistics examined patient-reported disease burden at baseline. Correlations explored clinical endpoint and HRQoL associations. Psychometrics included Cronbach's \u03b1 internal consistency and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Treatment impact on HRQoL was evaluated through HRQoL maintenance and response analyses. Patients (n=127) had a mean age of 62 years, a mean\u00b1SD hemoglobin of 13.0\u00b12.6 g/dl, and a mean\u00b1SD lactic dehydrogenase of 394\u00b1454 IU/l. Ninety-eight percent were Caucasian, 67% were men, and 64% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0. Baseline BPI worst pain and MS scores (mean\u00b1SD) were 1.6\u00b12.2 and 54.5\u00b17.2, respectively. Top three patient-reported health decrements in the MS were appetite, fatigue, and limited physical activity. Observed HRQoL decrements were consistent with the literature. MS and BPI worst pain item demonstrated good psychometrics: Cronbach's \u03b1 and ICC for the MS were 0.79 and 0.86, respectively; BPI ICC was 0.74.

Transgenic mice have been developed based on rare familial forms of AD and frontotemporal dementia, allowing investigators to test in detail the structural, functional, and behavioral consequences of AD-associated pathology. Here, we review work on transgenic AD models that investigate the degeneration of dendritic spine structure, synaptic function, and cognition. Together, these data support a model of AD pathogenesis in which soluble A\u03b2 initiates synaptic dysfunction and loss, as well as pathological changes in tau, which contribute to both synaptic and neuronal loss. These changes in synapse structure and function as well as frank synapse and neuronal loss contribute to the neural system dysfunction which causes cognitive deficits. Understanding the underpinnings of dementia in AD will be essential to develop and evaluate therapeutic approaches for this widespread and devastating disease."

Pembrolizumab (Keytruda(\u00ae)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), a key immunoinhibitory checkpoint protein implicated in down-regulating anti-tumour immune responses. This intravenous drug is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, on the basis of its clinical benefit in this setting in the phase I KEYNOTE 001 trial (expansion cohorts) and the phase II and III trials, KEYNOTE 002 and 006. These studies were conducted in ipilimumab-na\u00efve and/or ipilimumab-experienced patients and assessed varying pembrolizumab regimens administered every 2 or 3\u00a0weeks, all of which helped to determine the recommended dosage of 2\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks. In the trials with active comparator arms, pembrolizumab regimens significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rates (ORR) relative to ipilimumab in ipilimumab-na\u00efve patients (KEYNOTE 006), and significantly improved PFS and ORR, but not OS (although OS data are immature), relative to chemotherapy in ipilimumab-refractory patients, who had also received BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy if BRAF-mutation positive (KEYNOTE 002). Pembrolizumab has an acceptable tolerability profile, with immune-related adverse events that are generally manageable/reversible. Thus, pembrolizumab is a valuable treatment option for patients with advanced melanoma, including those who have progressed on ipilimumab and BRAF/MEK inhibitors."

All consecutive patients from two French centers with refractory or relapsed PCNSL treated with ESHAP/DHAP \u00b1 R were included. We analyzed the overall response rate (ORR), toxicity and overall survival (OS) after salvage chemotherapy. Intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell rescue (IC + HCR) was offered to patients less than 65 years of age and consisted of high-dose thiotepa, busulfan and cyclophosphamide. These results were compared with two previously reported series of PCNSL patients treated with the CYVE (high-dose cytarabine and etoposide) regimen at relapse. Twenty-two patients received a total of 60 DHAP/ESHAP cycles (median 3; range 1-5). The median age was 59 years. The ORR after salvage chemotherapy was 59%. Toxicity was mainly hematological, 18% of patients showing febrile neutropenia. There was no treatment-related death. ESHAP or DHAP regimens led to similar ORRs compared to the CYVE regimen in relapsed or refractory PCNSL, although they seemed less toxic. The therapeutic results of the ESHAP/DHAP regimens in relapsed or refractory PCNSL were also similar to those for relapsed systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (sNHL). Both chemotherapies, CYVE regimen and ESHAP/DHAP are treatment options to be considered in relapsed or refractory PCNSL, especially when IC + HCR is planned as a consolidation treatment. More efforts are still needed to improve the ORR at relapse."

The recently established reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka represents a valuable tool for future therapeutic applications. To date, the mechanisms underlying this process are still largely unknown. In particular, the mechanisms how the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) directly drive reprogramming and which additional components are involved are still not yet understood. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the role of ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like one (Artd1; formerly called poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 [Parp1]) during reprogramming. We found that poly(ADP-ribosylation) (PARylation) of the reprogramming factor Sox2 by Artd1 plays an important role during the first days upon transduction with the reprogramming factors. A process that happens before Artd1 in conjunction with 10-11 translocation-2 (Tet2) mediates the histone modifications necessary for the establishment of an activated chromatin state at pluripotency loci (e.g., Nanog and Essrb) [Nature 2012;488:652-655]. Wild-type (WT) fibroblasts treated with an Artd1 inhibitor as well as fibroblasts deficient for Artd1 (Artd1-/-) show strongly decreased reprogramming capacity. Our data indicate that Artd1-mediated PARylation of Sox2 favors its binding to the fibroblast growth factor 4 (Fgf4) enhancer, thereby activating Fgf4 expression. The importance of Fgf4 during the first 4 days upon initiation of reprogramming was also highlighted by the observation that exogenous addition of Fgf4 was sufficient to restore the reprogramming capacity of Artd1-/- fibroblast to WT levels. In conclusion, our data clearly show that the interaction between Artd1 and Sox2 is crucial for the first steps of the reprogramming process and that early expression of Fgf4 (day 2 to day 4) is an essential component for the successful generation of iPSCs."

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) family peptides are ligands for the EGF receptor (EGFR). Here, we elucidate functional differences among EGFR ligands and mechanisms underlying these distinctions. In 32D/EGFR myeloid and MCF10A breast cells, soluble amphiregulin (AR), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1), neuregulin 2 beta, and epigen stimulate greater EGFR coupling to cell proliferation and DNA synthesis than do EGF, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and epiregulin. EGF competitively antagonizes AR, indicating that its functional differences reflect dissimilar intrinsic activity at EGFR. EGF stimulates much greater phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr1045 than does AR. Moreover, the EGFR Y1045F mutation and z-cbl dominant-negative mutant of the c-cbl ubiquitin ligase potentiate the effect of EGF but not of AR. Both EGF and AR stimulate phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr992. However, the EGFR Y992F mutation and phospholipase C gamma inhibitor U73122 reduce the effect of AR much more than that of EGF. Expression of TGF\u03b1 in 32D/EGFR cells causes greater EGFR coupling to cell proliferation than does expression of EGF. Moreover, expression of EGF in 32D/EGFR cells causes these cells to be largely refractory to stimulation with soluble EGF. Thus, EGFR ligands are functionally distinct in models of paracrine and autocrine signaling and EGFR coupling to biological responses may be specified by competition among functionally distinct EGFR ligands."

INTRODUCTION: Warfarin is an anticoagulant that is difficult to administer because of its narrow therapeutic margin and the numerous factors that influence patient response. OBJECTIVE: Demographic, clinical and genetic variables were characterized to establish the appropriate maintenance dosages of warfarin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Colombian patients consisted of 145 adults of both sexes. They were in stable anticoagulation status with international normalized ratio between 2 and 3 for at least two months, and without changes in the warfarin commercial preparation or in the dosage. After signing the informed consent, the following data was recorded for each volunteer: age, gender, weight, height, smoker status, co-morbidity, co-medication, International Normalized Ratio (INR), warfarin dose, and commercial brand. Each patient was typed for genes CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2 and PROC; for 59 patients, the serum levels of warfarin were quantified. The genotyping and the blood quantification were performed by mini-sequencing and HPLC methods, respectively. RESULTS: Age, co-medication with enzymatic inhibitors (amiodarone, sertraline, fluoxetine) or inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine), and the alleles rs1799853 (*2) and rs1057910 (*3) of the CYP2C9 gene, as well as rs9923231 of the VKORC1 gene were associated with warfarin dose required to achieve anticoagulation with INR of 2-3. These variables were included in a multiple linear regression model for predicting the optimum dose/week of warfarin. This resulted in an algorithm that explained 47.4% of the variability in the dose responses. CONCLUSION: Clinical and pharmacogenetic variables provided a basis for improving the safety and effective dosage of warfarin; however, the use of a pharmacogenetic algorithm will require patient data obtained during clinical trials."

RESULTS: We performed a whole-genome integrative analysis of methylation and gene expression profiles in 40 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. We also screened for associations between the level of methylation of CpG sites and overall survival in a cohort of 50 patients uniformly treated by surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (STUPP protocol).

Thirteen of the genes with concordant CpG sites displayed an inverse correlation between promoter methylation and expression level in glioblastomas: B3GNT5, FABP7, ZNF217, BST2, OAS1, SLC13A5, GSTM5, ME1, UBXD3, TSPYL5, FAAH, C7orf13, and C3orf14. Survival analysis identified six CpG sites associated with overall survival. SOX10 promoter methylation status (two CpG sites) stratified patients similarly to MGMT status, but with a higher Area Under the Curve (0.78 vs. 0.71, p-value < 5e-04). The methylation status of the FNDC3B, TBX3, DGKI, and FSD1 promoters identified patients with MGMT-methylated tumors that did not respond to STUPP treatment (p-value < 1e-04). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first genome-wide integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles obtained from the same GBM cohort. We also present a methylome-based survival analysis for one of the largest uniformly treated GBM cohort ever studied, for more than 27,000 CpG sites. We have identified genes whose expression may be tightly regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and markers that may guide treatment decisions."

RESULTS: Striae are documented to cause Koebner phenomenon in patients with preexisting vitiligo, psoriasis and lichen planus, the three conditions where 'true kobenerisation' has been suggested according to Boyd and Nelder classification. CONCLUSIONS: Striae distensae and striae gravidarum are examples of blunt trauma. Just as happens with penetrating trauma, striae too are shown to be responsible for causing the Koebner phenomenon."

Escherichia coli K12 mutant strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) were submitted to increasing concentrations of cisplatin, and the results revealed that uvrA and uvrB mutants are sensitive to this agent, while uvrC and cho mutants remain as the wild type strain. The time required for both gene expression turn-off and return to normal weight DNA in wild-type E. coli was not accomplished even after 4 h post-treatment with cisplatin, while the same process takes place within 1.5 h after ultraviolet radiation (UV). Besides, a heavily damaging action of cisplatin can be seen not only by persistent nicks on genomic DNA, but also by NER gene expression exceeding manifold that seen after equivalent lethal doses of UV. Moreover, cisplatin caused an increase in uvrB gene expression from its putative upstream promoter P3 in an SOS-independent manner."

Molecular tools that can provide an estimate of the in situ growth rate of Geobacter species could improve understanding of dissimilatory metal reduction in a diversity of environments. Whole-genome microarray analyses of a subsurface isolate of Geobacter uraniireducens, grown under a variety of conditions, identified a number of genes that are differentially expressed at different specific growth rates. Expression of two genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rpsC and rplL, was further evaluated with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in cells with doubling times ranging from 6.56 h to 89.28 h. Transcript abundance of rpsC correlated best (r(2) = 0.90) with specific growth rates. Therefore, expression patterns of rpsC were used to estimate specific growth rates of Geobacter species during an in situ uranium bioremediation field experiment in which acetate was added to the groundwater to promote dissimilatory metal reduction. Initially, increased availability of acetate in the groundwater resulted in higher expression of Geobacter rpsC, and the increase in the number of Geobacter cells estimated with fluorescent in situ hybridization compared well with specific growth rates estimated from levels of in situ rpsC expression. However, in later phases, cell number increases were substantially lower than predicted from rpsC transcript abundance. This change coincided with a bloom of protozoa and increased attachment of Geobacter species to solid phases. These results suggest that monitoring rpsC expression may better reflect the actual rate that Geobacter species are metabolizing and growing during in situ uranium bioremediation than changes in cell abundance."

BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), in 1924 first described by Moschcowitz, is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome associated with thrombocytopenia, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, neurologic changes, renal impairment, and fever. TTP is found after various bacterial or viral infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and also in association with different drugs. PATHOGENESIS: After initial endothelial cell injury unusually large von Willebrand factors (vWF) are found in plasma of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Because of impaired proteolysis these large forms lead to thrombosis of the small vessels. The microangiopathy is followed by mechanical destruction of red cells. In peripheral blood smears these fragmentocytes are important for diagnosis and clinical course. THERAPY: The therapy of choice is plasma exchange against fresh frozen plasma, whereupon the mortality could be dramatically reduced in the past decades. In case of treatment resistance to plasma exchange there exists no common treatment schedule. One therapy option is immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and vincristine. In case of chronic relapsing TTP splenectomy should be discussed. In spite of severe thrombocytopenia substitution of thrombocytes is contraindicated."

Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder which can be classified according to the underlying neuropathology and is associated with disturbances of respiration, laryngeal function, airflow direction, and articulation resulting in difficulties of speech quality and intelligibility. There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system. The sixth is generally termed a mixed dysarthria and is associated with damage in more than one area, resulting in speech characteristics of at least two groups. The features of the speech disturbance of these six major types of dysarthria are distinctive and can assist with diagnosis. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom of many neurological conditions and is commonly associated with progressive neurological disease. It has a profound effect upon the patient and their families as communication is integrally related with expressing personality and social relationships. Speech and language therapy can be used to encourage the person to use the speech that is already available to them more effectively, can increase the range and consistency of sound production, can teach strategies for improving intelligibility and communicative effectiveness, can guide the individual to use methods that are less tiring and more successful, and can introduce the appropriate Augmentative and Alternative Communication approaches as and when required."

Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, encompassing several intrinsic subtypes with various morphological and molecular features, natural history and response to therapy. Currently, molecular targeted therapies are available for estrogen receptor (ER)(-) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-positive breast tumors. However, a significant proportion of primary breast cancers are negative for ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), and Her2, comprising the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) group. Women with TNBC have a poor prognosis because of the aggressive nature of these tumors and current lack of suitable targeted therapies. As a consequence, the identification of novel relevant protein targets for this group of patients is of great importance. Using a systematic two dimensional (2D) gel-based proteomic profiling strategy, applied to the analysis of fresh TNBC tissue biopsies, in combination with a three-tier orthogonal technology (two dimensional PAGE/silver staining coupled with MS, two dimensional Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry) approach, we aimed to identify targetable protein markers that were present in a significant fraction of samples and that could define therapy-amenable sub-groups of TNBCs. We present here our results, including a large cumulative database of proteins based on the analysis of 78 TNBCs, and the identification and validation of one specific protein, Mage-A4, which was expressed in a significant fraction of TNBC and Her2-positive/ER negative lesions. The high level expression of Mage-A4 in the tumors studied allowed the detection of the protein in the tumor interstitial fluids as well as in sera. The existence of immunotherapeutics approaches specifically targeting this protein, or Mage-A protein family members, and the fact that we were able to detect its presence in serum suggest novel management options for TNBC and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive/estrogen receptor negative patients bearing Mage-A4 positive tumors."

We analyzed COL5A1 and COL5A2 in 126 patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of classic EDS. In 93 patients, a type V collagen defect was found, of which 73 were COL5A1 mutations, 13 were COL5A2 mutations and seven were COL5A1 null-alleles with mutation unknown. The majority of the 73 COL5A1 mutations generated a COL5A1 null-allele, whereas one-third were structural mutations, scattered throughout COL5A1. All COL5A2 mutations were structural mutations. Reduced availability of type V collagen appeared to be the major disease-causing mechanism, besides other intra- and extracellular contributing factors. All type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102 patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. No COL5A1/COL5A2 mutation was detected in 24 patients who displayed skin and joint hyperextensibility but lacked dystrophic scarring.

Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5). A preceding screening transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) with an aortic diameter of 3.2 cm; at the time of moyamoya diagnosis, the aorta was 3.5 cm with mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. Four years later, the patient had had an acute aortic dissection, Stanford type A, which was repaired successfully. This case report is the third individual with TS associated with moyamoya disease and the first associated with dissection. The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with BAV).

An increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms, leiomyomas, adrenal cortical hyperplasia, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and renal angiomyolipoma has been noted in the MEN1 population. The pathogenesis of non-neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1 is unknown. We report a complex clinical course and a detailed morphologic and genetic analysis of a series of tumors that developed in a patient with MEN1. All tumors were microdissected and analyzed for loss of heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene. A germline mutation of the MEN1 gene was detected, and deletions of the MEN1 gene were consistently detected in multiple neuroendocrine tumors involving the parathyroid glands and the pancreas and a hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastasis, as predicted by Knudson's \"two hit\" hypothesis. Two hits of the MEN1 gene were also detected in esophageal leiomyoma tissue, suggesting that tumorigenesis was directly related to the patient's underlying MEN1. In contrast, follicular thyroid adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, and adrenal cortical hyperplasia consistently showed retained heterozygosity of the MEN1 gene with flanking markers and an intragenic marker. Therefore, these tumors appear to develop along pathogenetic pathways that are different from classical MEN1-associated tumors."

DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification and plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Within the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt3a and 3b establish methylation marks during early development, while Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns after DNA replication. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. Gelfiltration analysis showed that purified Dnmt1 elutes at an apparent molecular weight corresponding to the size of a dimer. With protein interaction assays we could show that Dnmt1 interacts with itself through its N-terminal regulatory domain. By deletion analysis and co-immunoprecipitations we mapped the dimerization domain to the targeting sequence TS that is located in the center of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 310-629) and was previously shown to mediate replication independent association with heterochromatin at chromocenters. Further mutational analyses suggested that the dimeric complex has a bipartite interaction interface and is formed in a head-to-head orientation. Dnmt1 dimer formation could facilitate the discrimination of hemi-methylated target sites as has been found for other palindromic DNA sequence recognizing enzymes. These results assign an additional function to the TS domain and raise the interesting question how these functions are spatially and temporarily co-ordinated."

Through the movement of their motile cilia, ependymal cells control the cerebrospinal fluid flow within the ventricular system from which they receive secreted molecules and morphogens controlling self-renewal and differentiation decisions of adult neural stem cells. Multiciliated ependymal cells become fully differentiated at postnatal stages however they are specified during mid to late embryogenesis from a population of radial glial cells. Here we discuss recent findings suggesting that 2 novel molecules, Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players on radial glial specification to ependymal cells. Both proteins were initially described as cell cycle regulators revealing sequence similarity to Geminin. They are expressed in radial glial cells committed to the ependymal cell lineage during embryogenesis, while overexpression and knock down experiments showed that are sufficient and necessary for ependymal cell generation. We propose that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key components of the molecular cascade that promotes radial glial cells fate commitment toward multiciliated ependymal cell lineage operating upstream of c-Myb and FoxJ1."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a tumor microenvironment (TME) that overexpresses vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), which can lead to neovascularization, tumor growth and metastasis. Therapeutic strategies inhibiting these signaling pathways might lead to innovative HNSCC treatments. Five HNSCC cell lines were characterized based on VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression by sqRT-PCR and treated with three different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nintedanib, dovitinib and pazopanib), all of which are effective against VEGFR and FGFR family members. Crystal violet assays were performed to analyze the effect of the treatments on cell growth (viability). Additionally, VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and statistical analyses were performed to investigate the receptor expression level in the different cell lines and the efficacy of the single-agent treatments. A correlation analysis was performed to quantify the degree of relationship between receptor expression and drug efficacy. With the exception of VEGFR2, the targeted receptors were expressed at different levels in all of the cell lines. The cell lines exhibited concentration-dependent responses with cell line-specific differences toward two of the three TKIs (nintedanib and dovitinib). Notably, all of the cell lines were resistant to pazopanib. TKIs have potential as therapeutic agents for HNSCC. Cell line-specific differences were observed in our in\u00a0vitro experiments. The observed pazopanib resistance could be explained by receptor expression. Further investigation is required to determine TKI efficacy in HNSCC."

The aim of this study was to describe the findings of routine clinical, auditory and vestibular tests in patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's and Lyme disease and to use electrocochleography (ECoG) to assess the presence of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in both diseases.

There was one case with isolated hearing loss in the Lyme disease group. Typical clinical manifestations of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease (vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) were found in 6/11 patients (54.5%) in the Lyme disease group. The ECoG results indicated that there were 65/91 patients (71.4%) with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and 5 patients (45.5%) with Lyme disease who presented with EH. No statistically significant difference was found between the incidence of different symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's and Lyme disease. On the basis of these results, patients with Lyme disease should undergo careful examination and investigation, especially in endemic regions.

Most of families with EDMD show X-linked recessive inheritance with mutations in the STA gene on chromosome Xq28, which encodes a protein named emerin. A rare autosomal dominant form of EDMD (AD-EDMD) is caused by mutations in lamin A/C gene (LMNA) on chromosome 1q21. Both emerin and lamin A/C are located in the inner surface membrane of the nucleus. A 49-year-old woman was skinny and slow runner from childhood and suspected as having a certain muscular disorder. At 35 years, she was found to have the second degree atrioventricular block. At 45 years, she was admitted to a hospital for right-side hemiplegia after cerebral infarction. Cardiac involvement was also observed including high degree atrioventricular block with chronic atrial fibrillation and frequent paroxysmal ventricular contraction on the electrocardiogram. At 49 years, she was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. She had possible dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction block. She also had muscular atrophy and weakness in all extremities, predominantly in the right-side, and contracture of bilateral Achilles tendon, knee and elbow joints, and postcervical muscles. Biopsied skeletal muscle and electromyogram showed myopathic changes. Since a novel point mutation of Ser303Pro was found in exon 5 of LMNA gene, she was diagnosed as having AD-EDMD and had a permanent pacemaker implantation. Her daughter also had some abnormalities on electrocardiogram. This is the first Japanese case of AD-EDMD. Amiodaron was effective for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Early diagnosis and following cardiological examinations and treatments are important and necessary to improve the prognosis of the patients with EDMD."

BACKGROUND: Although recent studies have identified genes expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that induce pluripotency, the molecular underpinnings of normal stem cell function remain poorly understood. The high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) gene is highly expressed in hESCs and poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers; however, its role in these settings has been unclear. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that HMGA1 is highly expressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs and hESCs, with intermediate levels in ECCs and low levels in fibroblasts. When hESCs are induced to differentiate, HMGA1 decreases and parallels that of other pluripotency factors. Conversely, forced expression of HMGA1 blocks differentiation of hESCs. We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM). HMGA1 increases the number and size of iPSC colonies compared to OSKM controls. Surprisingly, there was normal differentiation in vitro and benign teratoma formation in vivo of the HMGA1-derived iPSCs. During the reprogramming process, HMGA1 induces the expression of pluripotency genes, including SOX2, LIN28, and cMYC, while knockdown of HMGA1 in hESCs results in the repression of these genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that HMGA1 binds to the promoters of these pluripotency genes in vivo. In addition, interfering with HMGA1 function using a short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative construct blocks cellular reprogramming to a pluripotent state. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming from a somatic cell to a fully pluripotent stem cell. These findings identify a novel role for HMGA1 as a key regulator of the stem cell state by inducing transcriptional networks that drive pluripotency. Although further studies are needed, these HMGA1 pathways could be exploited in regenerative medicine or as novel therapeutic targets for poorly differentiated, stem-like cancers."

The overall organization of cell division in Plasmodium is unique compared to that observed in model organisms because DNA replicates more than once per cell cycle at several points of its life cycle. The sequencing of the Plasmodium genome has also revealed the apparent absence of many key components (e.g. Cdt1, DDK and Cdc45) of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery that are responsible for the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). We have characterized the Plasmodium falciparum minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM) that plays a key role in the transition of pre-RC to the RC. Similar to other eukaryotes, the Plasmodium genome encodes six MCM subunits. Here, we show that expression levels of at least three of the PfMCM subunits, the homologues of MCM2, MCM6 and MCM7, change during the intraerythrocytic development cycle, peaking in schizont and decreasing in the ring and trophozoite stages. PfMCM2, 6 and 7 subunits interact with each other to form a developmentally regulated complex: these interactions are detectable in rings and schizonts, but not in trophozoites. PfMCM2, 6 and 7 subunits are localized in both cytosolic and nucleosolic fractions during all intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum development, with increased nuclear localization in schizonts. Only PfMCM6 is associated with the chromatin fraction at all stages of growth. No phosphorylation of PfMCM2, 6 and 7 was detected, but two as yet unidentified threonine-phosphosphorylated proteins were present in the complex, whose pattern of phosphorylation varied during parasite development."

The present work proposes alternative methods of DT purification using affinity chromatography and of DT detoxification through conjugating with the polymer methoxypolyethylene glycol activated (mPEG). Tests were performed to evaluate: the formation of edemas and the presence of dermonecrotic activity, in vitro cytotoxicity to Vero cells, the neutralizing activity of serum from guinea pigs immunized with the diphtheria toxoid inactivated with mPEG, and the immunogenic activity of the purified and modified toxin. The results indicated that purification with Blue Sepharose was an efficient method, yielding antigen purity equivalent to 2600 Lf/mg of protein nitrogen. The modification of the Purified Toxin with mPEG did not result in the formation of edema or necrosis although it was immunogenic and stimulated the formation of antibodies that could neutralize the Purified Toxin. The toxoid obtained from the purified toxin maintained its immunogenic characteristics, inducing antibodies with neutralizing activity; edema and necrosis were still observed, however."

However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes.

Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks."

Polycomb repression controls the expression of hundreds of genes involved in development and is mediated by essentially two classes of chromatin-associated protein complexes. The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27, an epigenetic mark that serves as a docking site for the PRC1 protein complex. Drosophila core PRC1 is composed of four subunits: Polycomb (Pc), Posterior sex combs (Psc), Polyhomeotic (Ph) and Sex combs extra (Sce). Each of these proteins has multiple orthologs in vertebrates, thus generating an enormous scope for potential combinatorial diversity. In particular, mammalian genomes encode five Pc family members: CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7 and CBX8. To complicate matters further, distinct isoforms might arise from single genes. Here, we address the functional role of the two human CBX2 isoforms. Owing to different polyadenylation sites and alternative splicing events, the human CBX2 locus produces two transcripts: a 5-exon transcript that encodes the 532-amino acid CBX2-1 isoform that contains the conserved chromodomain and Pc box and a 4-exon transcript encoding a shorter isoform, CBX2-2, lacking the Pc box but still possessing a chromodomain. Using biochemical approaches and a novel in vivo imaging assay, we show that the short CBX2-2 isoform lacking the Pc box, does not participate in PRC1 protein complexes, but self-associates in vivo and forms complexes of high molecular weight. Furthermore, the CBX2 short isoform is still able to repress transcription, suggesting that Polycomb repression might occur in the absence of PRC1 formation."

Junctin and junctate are two important proteins involved in calcium regulation in eukaryotic cells. To understand the regulation of these two proteins, we identified and functionally characterized one of the two promoter sequences of the AbetaH-J-J locus. We demonstrate that the P2 promoter of the AbetaH-J-J locus contains (i) a minimal sequence localized within a region -159 bp from the transcription initiation site, which is sufficient to activate transcription of both mRNAs; (ii) sequences which bind known transcriptional factors such as those belonging to the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2), MEF-3, and NF-kappaB protein families; and (iii) sequences bound by unknown proteins. The functional characterization of the minimal promoter in C2C12 cells and in the rat soleus muscle in vivo model indicates the existence of cis elements having positive and negative effects on transcription. In addition, our data demonstrate that in striated muscle cells the calcium-dependent transcription factor MEF-2 is crucial for the transcription activity directed by the P2 promoter. The transcription directed by the AbetaH-J-J P2 promoter is induced by high expression of MEF-2, further stimulated by calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, and inhibited by histone deacetylase 4."

          "context": "JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes. Genomic DNA of African trypanosomes contains a hypermodified thymidine residue termed base J (beta-d-glucosyl-HOMedU). This modified base is localized primarily to repetitive DNA, namely the telomeres, and is implicated in the regulation of antigenic variation. The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway. Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH). This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J. Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. We have previously shown that mutations in the TH domain of JBP1 kill its ability to stimulate J synthesis. Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis. While the individual JBP1 null and JBP2 null trypanosomes have reduced J levels, the deletion of both JBP1 and JBP2 generates a cell line that completely lacks base J but still contains glucosyl-transferase activity. Reintroduction of JBP2 in the J-null trypanosome stimulates HOMedU formation and site-specific synthesis of base J. We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis."

The aim of this study was to describe the findings of routine clinical, auditory and vestibular tests in patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's and Lyme disease and to use electrocochleography (ECoG) to assess the presence of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in both diseases. Transtympanic ECoG was performed in 91 patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and in 11 patients with confirmed Lyme disease. In both diseases the majority of patients had more than one complaint. There was one case with isolated hearing loss in the Lyme disease group. Typical clinical manifestations of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease (vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) were found in 6/11 patients (54.5%) in the Lyme disease group. The ECoG results indicated that there were 65/91 patients (71.4%) with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and 5 patients (45.5%) with Lyme disease who presented with EH. No statistically significant difference was found between the incidence of different symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's and Lyme disease. On the basis of these results, patients with Lyme disease should undergo careful examination and investigation, especially in endemic regions. The presence of EH does not exclude the presence of infection with borreliosis as a cause of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease-like symptoms."

This protein recruits the NER lesion-recognition factor UvrA, and then dissociates from the DNA. UvrA binds UvrB, and the assembled UvrAB* complex initiates repair. In mutants lacking active Mfd, TCR is absent. A gene transcribed by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase in E. coli also requires Mfd for TCR. The CSB protein (missing or defective in cells of patients with Cockayne syndrome, complementation group B) is essential for TCR in humans.

Type 1 fimbriae and flagella, two surface organelles critical for colonization of the urinary tract by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), mediate opposing virulence objectives. Type 1 fimbriae facilitate adhesion to mucosal cells and promote bacterial persistence in the urinary tract, while flagella propel bacteria through urine and along mucous layers during ascension to the upper urinary tract. Using a transposon screen of the E. coli CFT073 fim locked-ON (L-ON) mutant, a construct that constitutively expresses type 1 fimbriae and represses motility, we identified six mutants that exhibited a partial restoration of motility. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. When complemented with mutS in trans, motility was again repressed. To determine whether the MMR system, in general, is involved in this reciprocal control, we characterized the effects of gene deletions of other MMR components on UPEC motility. Isogenic deletions of mutS, mutH, and mutL were constructed in both wild-type CFT073 and fim L-ON backgrounds. All MMR mutants showed an increase in motility in the wild-type background, and \u0394mutH and \u0394mutS mutations increased motility in the fim L-ON background. Cochallenge of the wild-type strain with an MMR-defective strain showed a subtle but significant competitive advantage in the bladder and spleen for the MMR mutant using the murine model of ascending urinary tract infection after 48 h. Our findings demonstrate that the MMR system generally affects the reciprocal regulation of motility and adherence and thus could contribute to UPEC pathogenesis during urinary tract infections."

PURPOSE: To investigate the alteration of passive stiffness in the supraspinatus muscle after double-row (DR) and knotless transosseous-equivalent (KL-TOE) repair techniques, using shear wave elastography (SWE) in cadavers with rotator cuff tears. We also aimed to compare altered muscular stiffness after these repairs to that obtained from shoulders with intact rotator cuff tendon. METHODS: Twelve fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders with rotator cuff tear (tear size: small [6], medium-large [6]) were used. Passive stiffness of 4 anatomic regions in the supraspinatus muscle was measured based on an established SWE method. Each specimen underwent DR and KL-TOE footprint repairs at 30\u00b0 glenohumeral abduction. SWE values, obtained at 0\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 abduction, were assessed in 3 different conditions: preoperative (torn) and postoperative conditions with the 2 techniques. The increased ratio of SWE values after repair was compared among the 4 regions to assess stiffness distribution. In addition, SWE values were obtained on 12 shoulders with intact rotator cuff tendons as control. RESULTS: In shoulders with medium-large-sized tears, supraspinatus muscles showed an increased passive stiffness after rotator cuff repairs, and this was significantly observed at adducted positions. KL-TOE repair showed uniform stiffness changes among the 4 regions of the supraspinatus muscle (mean, 189% to 218% increase after repair), whereas DR repair caused a significantly heterogeneous stiffness distribution within the muscle (mean, 187% to 319% after repair, P\u00a0= .002). Although a repair-induced increase in muscle stiffness was observed also in small-sized tears, there were no significant differences in repaired stiffness changes between DR and KL-TOE (mean, 127% to 138% and 127% to 130% after repairs, respectively). Shoulders with intact rotator cuff tendon showed uniform SWE values among the 4 regions of the supraspinatus muscle (mean, 38.2 to 43.0\u00a0kPa). CONCLUSIONS: Passive stiffness of the supraspinatus muscle increases after rotator cuff repairs for medium-large-sized tears. KL-TOE technique for the medium-large-sized tear provided a more uniform stiffness distribution across the repaired supraspinatus muscles compared with the DR technique. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on this insight, investigating rotator cuff muscle stiffness changes, further studies using SWE may determine the optimal repair technique for various sizes of rotator cuff tears."

Tasimelteon (HETLIOZ\u2122) is an orally bioavailable agonist of the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors that has been approved in the US for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. It is the first US FDA-approved medication for this orphan indication. Melatonin is thought to play a role in governing the body's natural sleep-wake cycle through physiological processes regulated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The hormone is secreted by the pineal gland, with onset typically occurring when daylight begins to dim. In healthy, sighted individuals, the endogenous circadian period is a little over 24 hours, but is entrained to the 24-hour day through exposure to environmental cues, such as light and darkness. In the absence of these cues, synchronisation is lost and the circadian rhythm follows the intrinsic non-24-hour clock, resulting in disorders like non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. Because the rhythm of endogenous melatonin is considered to be a measure of the human circadian phase, the carefully timed administration of melatonin analogues, such as tasimelteon, can potentially promote circadian readjustment. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of tasimelteon leading to this first approval for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder."

While CHC has been associated with increases in HCC, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality, being cured of CHC is associated with improvement in these outcomes. Older interferon-based regimens were complex and toxic and required 6-12 months of therapy, with cure rates averaging around 40-45% for HCV genotype 1.

TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing, such as transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization and transport to dendrites. We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. We demonstrated that a specific aminoacidic interval (216-315) in the C-terminal region and the RNA-recognition motif 1 domain are both implicated in TDP-43 participation in SGs as their deletion prevented the recruitment of TDP-43 into SGs. Our data show that TDP-43 is a specific component of SGs and not of processing bodies, although we proved that TDP-43 is not necessary for SG formation, and its gene silencing does not impair cell survival during stress. The analysis of spinal cord tissue from ALS patients showed that SG markers are not entrapped in TDP-43 pathological inclusions. Although SGs were not evident in ALS brains, we speculate that an altered control of mRNA translation in stressful conditions may trigger motor neuron degeneration at early stages of the disease."

The first-generation assays detected IgG antibody and became positive 6 to 12 weeks postinfection. False-positive results occurred; thus, a two-test algorithm was developed using a Western blot or immunofluorescence test as a confirmatory procedure. The second-generation HIV test added recombinant antigens, and the third-generation HIV tests included IgM detection, reducing the test-negative window to approximately 3 weeks postinfection. Fourth- and fifth-generation HIV assays added p24 antigen detection to the screening assay, reducing the test-negative window to 11 to 14 days. A new algorithm addressed the fourth-generation assay's ability to detect both antibody and antigen and yet not differentiate between them. The fifth-generation HIV assay provides separate antigen and antibody results and will require yet another algorithm.

Tissue type plasminogen activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as alteplase. Alteplase is relatively clot specific and should cause less bleeding side effects than the non-specific agents such as streptokinase. Alteplase has been used successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries. It is probably equally effective or superior to streptokinase in opening arteries and reducing mortality in MI. Alteplase is most effective when given early in MI and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms. The effectiveness of alteplase in MI can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting is associated with a greater patency and lower rates of serious bleeding, recurrent ischaemia and death than alteplase in MI and is likely to take over from alteplase as the standard MI treatment. A reduced dose of alteplase to increase coronary artery patency prior to angioplasty may be useful in MI. An exciting new indication for the use of alteplase is in stroke, where it has become the first beneficial intervention. Alteplase is used to reopen occluded cerebral vessels but is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Alteplase is beneficial if given within 3 h of the onset of stroke but not after this time period. Therefore, the next challenge is to increase the percentage of people being diagnosed and treated within this period. Clinical trials have not established a role for alteplase in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes or deep vein thrombosis. However, alteplase is useful in treating pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral vascular disease."

OBJECTIVE: Dracorhodin perchlorate (DP) was a synthetic analogue of the antimicrobial anthocyanin red pigment dracorhodin. It was reported that DP could induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer, human gastric tumor cells and human melanoma, but the cytotoxic effect of DP on human breast cancer was not investigated. This study would investigate whether DP was a candidate chemical of anti-human breast cancer. METHODS: The MTT assay reflected the number of viable cells through measuring the activity of cellular enzymes. Phase contrast microscopy visualized cell morphology. Fluorescence microscopy detected nuclear fragmentation after Hoechst 33258 staining. Flowcytometric analysis of Annexin V-PI staining and Rodamine 123 staining was used to detect cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Real time PCR detected mRNA level. Western blot examined protein expression. RESULTS: DP dose and time-dependently inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells. DP inhibited MCF-7 cell growth through apoptosis. DP regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, which were mitochondrial pathway proteins, to decrease MMP, and DP promoted the transcription of Bax and inhibited Bcl-2. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c which localized in mitochondrial in physiological condition were released into cytoplasm when MMP was decreased. DP activated caspase-9, which was the downstream of mitochondrial pathway. Therefore DP decreased MMP to release AIF and cytochrome c into cytoplasm, further activating caspase 9, lastly led to apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Therefore DP was a candidate for anti-breast cancer, DP induced apoptosis of MCF-7 through mitochondrial pathway."

DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification and plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Within the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt3a and 3b establish methylation marks during early development, while Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns after DNA replication. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. Gelfiltration analysis showed that purified Dnmt1 elutes at an apparent molecular weight corresponding to the size of a dimer. With protein interaction assays we could show that Dnmt1 interacts with itself through its N-terminal regulatory domain. By deletion analysis and co-immunoprecipitations we mapped the dimerization domain to the targeting sequence TS that is located in the center of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 310-629) and was previously shown to mediate replication independent association with heterochromatin at chromocenters. Further mutational analyses suggested that the dimeric complex has a bipartite interaction interface and is formed in a head-to-head orientation. Dnmt1 dimer formation could facilitate the discrimination of hemi-methylated target sites as has been found for other palindromic DNA sequence recognizing enzymes. These results assign an additional function to the TS domain and raise the interesting question how these functions are spatially and temporarily co-ordinated."

BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait associated with risk of sudden death. The majority of cases of sudden death occur in young adults with no or few symptoms, which underlines the importance of risk stratification as a basis for selecting a therapeutic strategy. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are indicated in patients resuscitated following cardiac arrest, and those with sustained ventricular tachycardia or two or more risk factors identified in non-invasive tests. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the number of appropriate therapies (anti-tachycardia pacing and defibrillation) and the risk factors, or association of risk factors, that predict therapies in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. METHODS: We studied 17 consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardioverter-defibrillators implanted between December 1992 and June 2003. The following risk factors were analyzed: 1) previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia; 2) family history of sudden cardiac death; 3) high-risk genetic mutations; 4) syncope; 5) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; 6) hypotensive response to exercise; and 7) marked left ventricular hypertrophy. Appropriate therapies were determined and the predictive value of the different sudden death risk stratification parameters was analyzed. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 40 +/- 29 months, 7 patients (41%) received a total of 293 appropriate therapies. Of the 9 patients with previous cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia, 4 received appropriate therapies. In the remaining 8 patients, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention, 3 received appropriate therapies. Family history of sudden death was associated with a positive predictive value of 25% for appropriate therapies, 40% for syncope and 50% for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The presence of any two risk factors was associated with a positive predictive value of 33% and the presence of three factors with 100%. CONCLUSION: In this group of patients, considered to be at high risk for sudden cardiac death, a considerable percentage had ventricular tachycardias that were correctly identified and treated by the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The percentage of patients with appropriate therapies was slightly higher in the group who had a cardioverter-defibrillator for secondary prevention of sudden death (aborted sudden death or sustained ventricular tachycardia). In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was the risk factor with the highest predictive value. An association of risk factors was also predictive of arrhythmic events."

Causative germline missense mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been associated with over 92% of families with the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). MEN 2A is characterized primarily by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma, both tumors of neural crest origin. Parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma is also seen in MEN 2A, but rarely in MEN 2B, which has additional stigmata, including a marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract. In familial MTC, MTC is the only lesion present. Somatic RET mutations have also been identified in a subset of sporadic MTCs, pheochromocytomas, and rarely, small cell lung cancer, but not in sporadic parathyroid hyperplasias/adenomas or other neuroendocrine tumors. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor molecule GDNFR-alpha, have recently been identified as members of the RET ligand binding complex. Therefore, the genes encoding both GDNF and GDNFR-alpha are excellent candidates for a role in the pathogenesis of those MEN 2 families and sporadic neuroendocrine tumors without RET mutations. No mutations were found in the coding region of GDNF in DNA samples from 9 RET mutation negative MEN 2 individuals (comprising 6 distinct families), 12 sporadic MTCs, 17 sporadic cases of parathyroid adenoma, and 10 small cell lung cancer cell lines. Therefore, we find no evidence that mutation within the coding regions of GDNF plays a role in the genesis of MEN 2 and sporadic neuroendocrine tumors."

Despite some initial publications dating back to the 1950s, TAMs did not develop into an independent area of research until 2004, when they were rediscovered as potential ligands to a class of G protein-coupled receptors called trace-amine associated receptors. Since this discovery, two representatives of TAMs, namely 3-iodothyronamine (3-T(1)AM) and thyronamine (T(0)AM), have been detected in vivo. Intraperitoneal or central injection of 3-T(1)AM or T(0)AM into mice, rats, or Djungarian hamsters caused various prompt effects, such as metabolic depression, hypothermia, negative chronotropy, negative inotropy, hyperglycemia, reduction of the respiratory quotient, ketonuria, and reduction of fat mass. Although their physiological function remains elusive, 3-T(1)AM and T(0)AM have already revealed promising therapeutic potential because they represent the only endogenous compounds inducing hypothermia as a prophylactic or acute treatment of stroke and might thus be expected to cause fewer side effects than synthetic compounds. This review article summarizes the still somewhat scattered data on TAMs obtained both recently and more than 20 yr ago to yield a complete and updated picture of the current state of TAM research."

BACKGROUND: Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-ab)-associated cerebellar ataxia is a rare neurological disorder characterized by cerebellar symptoms concomitant with high GAD-ab levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CASE REPORT: We report on 2 female siblings (aged 74 and 76 years) presenting with gradual progression of rotational vertigo, gait ataxia and vertical diplopia, continuously progressing for 6 months and 6 years, respectively. Autoimmune laboratory examinations showed remarkably increased serum and CSF GAD-ab levels. Their medical histories revealed late-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and other concomitant autoimmune disorders (Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Cerebral MRI and laboratory examinations were unremarkable. The diagnosis of GAD-ab-associated cerebellar ataxia with particular brainstem involvement was established in both women. After the exclusion of an underlying malignancy, immunosuppressive therapy has been initiated in both patients, which resulted in stabilization in one and in clinical improvement in the other patient. DISCUSSION: The unique association of autoantibody-mediated cerebellar ataxia and late-onset T1DM in 2 siblings with similar clinical and paraclinical phenotypes strengthens the concept that hereditary factors might play a relevant role also in autoimmune diseases so far considered to be sporadic. Moreover, the occurrence of continuous vertical diplopia broadens the clinical spectrum of GAD-ab-associated neurological syndromes."

They have an active role in genetic variation, adaptation and evolution through the duplication or deletion of genes or their regulatory elements, and transposable elements themselves can act as alternative promoters for nearby genes, resulting in non-canonical regulation of transcription. However, transposable element activity can lead to detrimental genome instability, and hosts have evolved mechanisms to silence transposable element mobility appropriately. Recent studies have demonstrated that a subset of transposable elements, endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) containing long terminal repeats (LTRs), are silenced through trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by ESET (also known as SETDB1 or KMT1E) and a co-repressor complex containing KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1; also known as TRIM28) in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here we show that the replacement histone variant H3.3 is enriched at class I and class II ERVs, notably those of the early transposon (ETn)/MusD family and intracisternal A-type particles (IAPs). Deposition at a subset of these elements is dependent upon the H3.3 chaperone complex containing \u03b1-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and death-domain-associated protein (DAXX). We demonstrate that recruitment of DAXX, H3.3 and KAP1 to ERVs is co-dependent and occurs upstream of ESET, linking H3.3 to ERV-associated H3K9me3. Importantly, H3K9me3 is reduced at ERVs upon H3.3 deletion, resulting in derepression and dysregulation of adjacent, endogenous genes, along with increased retrotransposition of IAPs. Our study identifies a unique heterochromatin state marked by the presence of both H3.3 and H3K9me3, and establishes an important role for H3.3 in control of ERV retrotransposition in embryonic stem cells."

Here we examined the role of km23-1 in TGF\u03b21 autoinduction in TGF\u03b2-sensitive epithelial cells. siRNA blockade of km23-1 reduced TGF\u03b21 mRNA expression, as well as DNA binding and transcriptional activation of the relevant activator protein-1 site in the human TGF\u03b21 promoter. Further, knockdown of km23-1 inhibited TGF\u03b2-mediated activation of ERK and JNK, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and transactivation of the c-Jun promoter. Sucrose gradient analyses indicate that km23-1 was present in lipid rafts together with Ras and T\u03b2RII after TGF\u03b2 treatment. Immunoprecipitation/blot analyses revealed the formation of a TGF\u03b2-inducible complex between Ras and km23-1 in vivo within minutes of TGF\u03b2 addition. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that km23-1 is required for Ras activation by TGF\u03b2. Our results indicate that km23-1 is required for TGF\u03b21 autoinduction through Smad2-independent Ras/ERK/JNK pathways. More importantly, our findings demonstrate that km23-1 functions as a critical adaptor coupling T\u03b2R activation to activation of Ras effector pathways downstream."

However, it remains a difficult drug to manage mostly because of its narrow therapeutic index and wide interpatient variability in anticoagulant effects. Over the past decade, there has been substantial progress in our understanding of genetic contributions to variable warfarin response, particularly with regard to warfarin dose requirements. The genes encoding for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) are the major genetic determinants of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively. Numerous studies have demonstrated significant contributions of these genes to warfarin dose requirements. The CYP2C9 gene has also been associated with bleeding risk with warfarin. The CYP4F2 gene influences vitamin K availability and makes minor contributions to warfarin dose requirements. Less is known about genes influencing warfarin response in African-American patients compared with other racial groups, but this is the focus of ongoing research. Several warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms and United States Food and Drug Administration-cleared genotyping tests are available for clinical use. Clinical trials are ongoing to determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of genotypeguided warfarin dosing. Results from these trials will likely influence clinical uptake and third party payer reimbursement for genotype-guided warfarin therapy. There is still a lack of pharmacogenetic data for the newly approved oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, and with other oral anticoagulants in the research and development pipeline. These data, once known, could be of great importance as routine monitoring parameters for these agents are not available."

From single cell organisms to the most complex life forms, the 24-hour circadian rhythm is important for numerous aspects of physiology and behavior such as daily periodic fluctuations in body temperature and sleep-wake cycles. Influenced by environmental cues - mainly by light input -, the central pacemaker in the thalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) controls and regulates the internal clock mechanisms which are present in peripheral tissues. In order to correlate modifications in the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythm with the pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia, this study aimed to investigate the dynamics of the expression of circadian clock genes in dermal fibroblasts of idiopathic hypersomniacs (IH) in comparison to those of healthy controls (HC). Ten clinically and polysomnographically proven IH patients were recruited from the department of sleep medicine of the University Hospital of Muenster. Clinical diagnosis was done by two consecutive polysomnographies (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Fourteen clinical healthy volunteers served as control group. Dermal fibroblasts were obtained via punch biopsy and grown in cell culture. The expression of circadian clock genes was investigated by semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR qRT-PCR analysis, confirming periodical oscillation of expression of the core circadian clock genes BMAL1, PER1/2 and CRY1/2. The amplitude of the rhythmically expressed BMAL1, PER1 and PER2 was significantly dampened in dermal fibroblasts of IH compared to HC over two circadian periods whereas the overall expression of only the key transcriptional factor BMAL1 was significantly reduced in IH. Our study suggests for the first time an aberrant dynamics in the circadian clock in IH. These findings may serve to better understand some clinical features of the pathophysiology in sleep - wake rhythms in IH."

We present EP-DNN, a protocol for predicting enhancers based on chromatin features, in different cell types. Specifically, we use a deep neural network (DNN)-based architecture to extract enhancer signatures in a representative human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and a differentiated lung cell type (IMR90). We train EP-DNN using p300 binding sites, as enhancers, and TSS and random non-DHS sites, as non-enhancers. We perform same-cell and cross-cell predictions to quantify the validation rate and compare against two state-of-the-art methods, DEEP-ENCODE and RFECS. We find that EP-DNN has superior accuracy with a validation rate of 91.6%, relative to 85.3% for DEEP-ENCODE and 85.5% for RFECS, for a given number of enhancer predictions and also scales better for a larger number of enhancer predictions. Moreover, our H1 \u2192 IMR90 predictions turn out to be more accurate than IMR90 \u2192 IMR90, potentially because H1 exhibits a richer signature set and our EP-DNN model is expressive enough to extract these subtleties. Our work shows how to leverage the full expressivity of deep learning models, using multiple hidden layers, while avoiding overfitting on the training data. We also lay the foundation for exploration of cross-cell enhancer predictions, potentially reducing the need for expensive experimentation."

BACKGROUND: Studying protein complexes is very important in biological processes since it helps reveal the structure-functionality relationships in biological networks and much attention has been paid to accurately predict protein complexes from the increasing amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Most of the available algorithms are based on the assumption that dense subgraphs correspond to complexes, failing to take into account the inherence organization within protein complex and the roles of edges. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the possibility of discovering protein complexes using the topological information hidden in edges. RESULTS: To provide an investigation of the roles of edges in PPI networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar vertices in topology are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity, indicating the weak ties phenomenon in PPI networks. We further demonstrate that there is a negative relation between the weak tie strength and the topological similarity. By using the bridges, a reliable virtual network is constructed, in which each maximal clique corresponds to the core of a complex. By this notion, the detection of the protein complexes is transformed into a classic all-clique problem. A novel core-attachment based method is developed, which detects the cores and attachments, respectively. A comprehensive comparison among the existing algorithms and our algorithm has been made by comparing the predicted complexes against benchmark complexes. CONCLUSIONS: We proved that the weak tie effect exists in the PPI network and demonstrated that the density is insufficient to characterize the topological structure of protein complexes. Furthermore, the experimental results on the yeast PPI network show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. The analysis of detected modules by the present algorithm suggests that most of these modules have well biological significance in context of complexes, suggesting that the roles of edges are critical in discovering protein complexes."

INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma is the most frequent type of embryonal tumor in the pediatric population, accounting for 20-25% of all brain tumors in children. Recently, the suspected contribution of the Polycomb group (PcG) genes in medulloblastoma development was described. PcG genes play an important role in developmental processes; they are also involved in the self-renewal of hematopoietic and neural stem cells as well as in malignant transformation. PURPOSE: In this study, we evaluated the expression of BMI1and PCGF2, members of family of PcG genes, and their potential target, MYC oncogene, and analyzed their association with demographic and clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (18 males and 13 females, aged from 0.4 to 17\u00a0years) with medulloblastoma were included in this study. The gene's expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, obtained using the two-color multiplexing technique. RESULTS: We found that the higher expression levels of BMI1 and PCGF2 genes were associated with significantly decreased patient survival (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). Significant differences between gender were found, with a higher expression level of the PCGF2 gene observed among females (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed correlation between BMI1 and PCGF2 gene's expression and survival in children with medulloblastoma."

We used immunocytochemistry to study the ontogeny of leu-enkephalin and the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes dopamine beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in adjacent sections of 14 fetal rhesus and 31 fetal human adrenal glands. The adrenal medulla of a 24-week-old human fetus as well as medullas of 11 134- to 172-day-old rhesus fetuses were immunopositive with all 3 antisera employed. Furthermore, in thin serial sections of these glands, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and leu-enkephalin appeared to be colocalized in the same cells of the adrenal medulla. Twenty-six adrenals from fetuses 15-26 weeks stained lightly with one or more of the antisera. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase could be detected at 15 weeks, followed by leu-enkephalin and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase at 18-19 weeks. The role of the enkephalins during fetal life or in the adaptation to extrauterine life is not yet clear. In adults, enkephalins are cosecreted with catecholamines in response to stress. Our results suggest that the fetal adrenal may be capable of cosecretion of catecholamines and enkephalins, at least by the end of the second trimester of gestation."

Regulation of DNA replication initiation is essential for the faithful inheritance of genetic information. Replication initiation is a multi-step process involving many factors including ORC, Cdt1p, Mcm2-7p and other proteins that bind to replication origins to form a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). As a prerequisite for pre-RC assembly, Cdt1p and the Mcm2-7p heterohexameric complex accumulate in the nucleus in G1 phase in an interdependent manner in budding yeast. However, the nature of this interdependence is not clear, nor is it known whether Cdt1p is required for the assembly of the MCM complex. In this study, we provide the first evidence that Cdt1p, through its interaction with Mcm6p with the C-terminal regions of the two proteins, is crucial for the formation of the MCM complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. We demonstrate that disruption of the interaction between Cdt1p and Mcm6p prevents the formation of the MCM complex, excludes Mcm2-7p from the nucleus, and inhibits pre-RC assembly and DNA replication. Our findings suggest a function for Cdt1p in promoting the assembly of the MCM complex and maintaining its integrity by interacting with Mcm6p."

PURPOSE: Preclinical and early clinical studies have demonstrated that initial therapy with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is more effective in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma than single-agent BRAF inhibitors. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in patients who had received prior BRAF inhibitor treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label phase I/II study, we evaluated the pharmacology, safety, and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib. Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45). RESULTS: In parts B and C, confirmed objective response rates (ORR) were 15% (95% CI, 4% to 35%) and 13% (95% CI, 5% to 27%), respectively; an additional 50% and 44% experienced stable disease > 8 weeks, respectively. In part C, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2 to 4), and median overall survival was 11.8 months (95% CI, 8 to 25) from cross-over. Patients who previously received dabrafenib > 6 months had superior outcomes with the combination compared with those treated < 6 months; median PFS was 3.9 (95% CI, 3 to 7) versus 1.8 months (95% CI, 2 to 4; hazard ratio, 0.49; P = .02), and ORR was 26% (95% CI, 10% to 48%) versus 0% (95% CI, 0% to 15%). CONCLUSION: Dabrafenib plus trametinib has modest clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma. This regimen may be a therapeutic strategy for patients who previously benefited from BRAF inhibitor monotherapy > 6 months but demonstrates minimal efficacy after rapid progression with BRAF inhibitor therapy."

It is currently approved for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is being considered for licensing for multiple sclerosis (MS).When first used, alemtuzumab successfully reduced relapses and new lesion formation based on magnetic resonance imaging in people with progressive MS, but this cohort continued to accumulate disability, associated with progressive cerebral atrophy, presumably due to axonal degeneration. From this experience, we advocated that immunotherapies should be given early in the course of the disease. Since then, one phase II and two phase III trials have shown that alemtuzumab reduces the relapse rate, compared with the active comparator interferon beta-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a), in treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced MS up to 10 years from disease onset. Furthermore, in two of these trials, alemtuzumab reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with IFN\u03b2-1a; indeed alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and reduction in cerebral atrophy. Safety issues are infusion-associated reactions, mainly controlled by methyl-prednisolone, antihistamines, and antipyretics; mild to moderate infections; and autoimmunity. After 5 years, 30 to 40% of alemtuzumab patients have developed autoimmunity, largely against the thyroid gland, but rarely (2%) against platelets in immune thrombocytopenia, and in a few cases, Goodpasture's renal syndrome.Alemtuzumab is an effective therapy for early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, offering disability improvement at least to 5 years after treatment.

However, different checkpoint inhibitors were tested, different IHC assays were used, different targets were considered (tumor cells, immune infiltrates or both) and different expression thresholds were employed in clinical trials. In some trials the assay was used prospectively to select the patients, while in other trials it was evaluated retrospectively. Some confusion emerges, which makes it difficult to easily compare the literature data and to translate them in practice management.

Most frequent is a mutation of the gene for TREX-1. However, as well cases of families with mutations in the SAMHD1 gene and, recently, with one for the gene that codes for the protein stimulator of interferon genes have been described. These genes are involved in the process of the detection of intracellular DNA, and their mutation results in an increased production of type I interferons and their gene products, resulting in auto-inflammation and auto-immunity. JAK inhibitors have been successfully used to treat this disorder. Familial chilblain is a rare disorder with very distinct clinical signs.

CONCLUSION: After a long-term follow-up in an adjuvant setting, the benefit of six cycles of FEC 50 compared with three cycles, whatever the dose, is highly significant in terms of DFS. As regards OS, the group receiving six cycles of FEC 50 has significantly better results than the group receiving three cycles of FEC 50."

          "context": "Antipurinergic therapy corrects the autism-like features in the poly(IC) mouse model. BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Mitochondria act to connect genes and environment by regulating gene-encoded metabolic networks according to changes in the chemistry of the cell and its environment. Mitochondrial ATP and other metabolites are mitokines-signaling molecules made in mitochondria-that undergo regulated release from cells to communicate cellular health and danger to neighboring cells via purinergic signaling. The role of purinergic signaling has not yet been explored in autism spectrum disorders. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We used the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model of gestational poly(IC) exposure and treatment with the non-selective purinergic antagonist suramin to test the role of purinergic signaling in C57BL/6J mice. RESULTS: We found that antipurinergic therapy (APT) corrected 16 multisystem abnormalities that defined the ASD-like phenotype in this model. These included correction of the core social deficits and sensorimotor coordination abnormalities, prevention of cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, correction of the ultrastructural synaptic dysmorphology, and correction of the hypothermia, metabolic, mitochondrial, P2Y2 and P2X7 purinergic receptor expression, and ERK1/2 and CAMKII signal transduction abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperpurinergia is a fundamental and treatable feature of the multisystem abnormalities in the poly(IC) mouse model of autism spectrum disorders. Antipurinergic therapy provides a new tool for refining current concepts of pathogenesis in autism and related spectrum disorders, and represents a fresh path forward for new drug development."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess possible correlations between ultrasound findings and maternal serum biochemical ('triple test') markers among fetuses with trisomy 21 in the second trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort study of 72 pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 who had a second trimester ultrasound and biochemical screen performed at a single center between 1990 and 1999. The biochemical screen consisted of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), total beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and estriol (uE(3)). Marker levels were expressed in multiples of the median (MoM). The ultrasound findings assessed were major structural anomalies, short humerus length, short femur length, increased nuchal fold thickness (NF), hyperechoic bowel, echogenic intracardiac focus (EIF), ventriculomegaly, choroid plexus cysts and renal pyelectasis. RESULTS: Second trimester maternal serum biochemical markers and ultrasound findings appeared to be largely independent of each other. However, some significant correlations were observed. Estriol was significantly lower when a fetal cystic hygroma was detected on ultrasound compared to those with no cystic hygroma (0.40 vs. 0.70 MoM, p<0.05). The median hCG level was significantly lower in those pregnancies with a normal second trimester fetal ultrasound compared to those with positive ultrasound findings (2.07 vs. 2.87 MoM, p<0.05). Median hCG levels were also significantly higher in those cases with NF> or =5 mm as compared to those with NF<5 mm (2.99 vs. 2.49 MoM, p<0.05). This difference persisted after exclusion of the five cases with cystic hygromas (2.99 vs. 2.49 MoM, p<0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between log(10) hCG and log(10) NF MoM (Spearman's rho=0.252, p<0.05). NF was significantly greater among fetuses with an identifiable cardiac defect compared with those without a detectable cardiac defect (median of 7.0 mm vs. 3.8 mm, p<0.01). This difference persisted when expressed as multiples of the median (2.8 vs. 1.3 MoM, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Second trimester ultrasound and biochemical markers are largely independent in fetuses with trisomy 21, however significant correlations between the two were observed in the present series. These may be important in screening protocols that combine second trimester ultrasound and biochemical markers."

Uptake rates for the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine have been below the required 95% in the UK since a retracted and discredited article linking the MMR vaccine with autism and inflammatory bowel disease was released in 1998. This study undertook semi-structured telephone interviews among parents or carers of 47 unvaccinated measles cases who were aged between 13 months and 9 years, during a large measles outbreak in Merseyside. Results showed that concerns over the specific links with autism remain an important cause of refusal to vaccinate, with over half of respondents stating this as a reason. A quarter stated child illness during scheduled vaccination time, while other reasons included general safety concerns and access issues. Over half of respondents felt that more information or a discussion with a health professional would help the decision-making process, while a third stated improved access. There was clear support for vaccination among respondents when asked about current opinions regarding MMR vaccine. The findings support the hypothesis that safety concerns remain a major barrier to MMR vaccination, and also support previous evidence that experience of measles is an important determinant in the decision to vaccinate."

An inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide, leading to cross-reaction between the two types of predictions. To improve predictions further, it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes. In addition, topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the N terminus of the mature protein must be on the non-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Here, we present Phobius, a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor. The predictor is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states. Training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset. Compared to TMHMM and SignalP, errors coming from cross-prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by Phobius. False classifications of signal peptides were reduced from 26.1% to 3.9% and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from 19.0% to 7.7%. Phobius was applied to the proteomes of Homo sapiens and Escherichia coli. Here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to TMHMM/SignalP, suggesting that Phobius is well suited for whole-genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions.

One reason is that only very few high-resolution structures for transmembrane beta-barrel (TMB) proteins have been determined thus far. Here we introduced the design, statistics and results of a novel profile-based hidden Markov model for the prediction and discrimination of TMBs. The method carefully attempts to avoid over-fitting the sparse experimental data. While our model training and scoring procedures were very similar to a recently published work, the architecture and structure-based labelling were significantly different. In particular, we introduced a new definition of beta- hairpin motifs, explicit state modelling of transmembrane strands, and a log-odds whole-protein discrimination score. The resulting method reached an overall four-state (up-, down-strand, periplasmic-, outer-loop) accuracy as high as 86%. Furthermore, accurately discriminated TMB from non-TMB proteins (45% coverage at 100% accuracy). This high precision enabled the application to 72 entirely sequenced Gram-negative bacteria. We found over 164 previously uncharacterized TMB proteins at high confidence. Database searches did not implicate any of these proteins with membranes. We challenge that the vast majority of our 164 predictions will eventually be verified experimentally. All proteome predictions and the PROFtmb prediction method are available at http://www.rostlab.org/ services/PROFtmb/."

Previous work has demonstrated that lineage-specific transcription factors play essential roles in red blood cell development. More recent studies have shown that these factors participate in critical protein-protein interactions in addition to binding DNA. The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-1, a central mediator of erythroid gene expression, interacts with multiple proteins including FOG-1, EKLF, SP1, CBP/p300 and PU.1. The mechanisms by which these interactions influence GATA-1 function, as well as any possible relationships between these seemingly disparate complexes, remain incompletely understood. However, several new findings have provided further insight into the functional significance of some of these interactions. Studies involving point mutants of GATA-1 have shown that a direct physical interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is essential for normal human erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation in vivo. In addition, evidence has emerged that physical interaction between GATA-1 and the myeloid/lymphoid specific factor PU.1, an oncogene implicated in murine erythroleukemia, acts to functionally cross-antagonize one another. This provides a possible mechanism by which dysregulated expression of hematopoietic transcription factors leads to lineage maturation arrest in leukemias."

In this subanalysis, we investigated the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban and warfarin in relation to patients' CHADS2 scores. RESULTS: The mean CHADS2 score was 3.25, and the most frequent scores were 3 and 4. No statistically significant interactions were observed between principal safety outcome event rates and CHADS2 scores with respect to treatment groups (P value for interaction\u00a0=\u00a0.700). Irrespective of stratification into moderate- and high-risk groups based on CHADS2 scores of 2 and 3 or more, respectively, no differences in principal safety outcome event rates were observed between rivaroxaban- and warfarin-treated patients (moderate-risk group: hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], .58-1.95; high-risk group: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, .86-1.45; P value for interaction\u00a0=\u00a0.488).

Individuals with the same genetic disorder often show remarkable differences in clinical severity, a finding generally attributed to the genetic background. We identified two patients with genetically proven Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) who followed an unusual course and had uncommon clinicopathological findings. We hypothesized digenic inheritance and looked for additional molecular explanations. Mutations in additional separate genes were identified in both patients. The first patient was a member of a family with molecularly proven X-linked EDMD. However, the clinical features were unusually severe for this condition in the propositus: he presented at 2.5 years with severe proximal weakness and markedly elevated serum creatine kinase. Muscle weakness rapidly progressed, leading to loss of independent ambulation by the age of 12. In addition, the patient developed cardiac conduction system disease requiring pacing at the age of 11 and severe dilated cardiomyopathy in the early teens. Despite pacing, he had several syncopal episodes attributed to ventricular dysrhythmias. As these resemble the cardiac features of patients with the autosomal dominant variant of EDMD, we examined the lamin A/C gene, identifying a de-novo mutation in the propositus. The second patient had a cardioskeletal myopathy, similar to his mother who had died more than 20 years previously. Because of the dominant family history, a laminopathy was suspected and a mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene was identified. This mutation, however, was not present in his mother, but instead, surprisingly, was identified in his virtually asymptomatic father. Unusual accumulations of desmin found in the cardiac muscle of the propositus prompted us to examine the desmin gene in this patient, and in so doing, we identified a desmin mutation, in addition to the LMNA mutation in the propositus. These cases suggest that separate mutations in related proteins that are believed to interact, or that represent different parts of a presumed functional pathway, may synergistically contribute to disease severity in autosomal dominant EDMD. Furthermore, digenic inheritance may well contribute to the clinical severity of many other neuromuscular disorders."

While CHC has been associated with increases in HCC, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality, being cured of CHC is associated with improvement in these outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common health problems for children and adolescents. If not successfully treated, it can impact patients and families with significant disability due to loss of school, work, and social function. When headaches become frequent, it is essential to try to prevent the headaches. For children and adolescents, this is guided by extrapolation from adult studies, a limited number of small studies in children and adolescents and practitioner preference. The aim of the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) study is to determine the most effective preventive agent to use in children and adolescents. METHODS: CHAMP is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, comparative effectiveness study of amitriptyline and topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, designed to mirror real-world practice, sponsored by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institutes of Health (U01NS076788). The study will recruit 675 subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years old, inclusive, who have migraine with or without aura or chronic migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, with at least 4 headaches in the 28 days prior to randomization. The subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 (amitriptyline: topiramate: placebo) ratio. Doses are weight based and will be slowly titrated over an 8-week period to a target dose of 1 mg/kg of amitriptyline and 2 mg/kg of topiramate. The primary outcome will be a 50% reduction in headache frequency between the 28-day baseline and the final 28 days of treatment (weeks 20-24). CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the CHAMP study is to obtain level 1 evidence for the effectiveness of amitriptyline and topiramate in the prevention of migraine in children and adolescents. If this study proves to be positive, it will provide information to the practicing physician as how to best prevent migraine in children and adolescents and subsequently improve the disability and outcomes."

OBJECTIVE: To review available studies of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved in 2014 by the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched using the search terms empagliflozin, BI 10773, and BI10773, for entries between January 1, 2000, and December 1, 2014. Reference lists from retrieved articles were searched manually for additional peer-reviewed publications. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All publications reporting clinical trials of empagliflozin were eligible for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Empagliflozin is a new once-daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor with a mechanism of action that is independent of \u03b2-cell function and the insulin pathway. Data from a comprehensive phase III clinical trial program have demonstrated its efficacy as monotherapy, as add-on to other glucose-lowering agents, and in different patient populations. In these studies, empagliflozin resulted in improvements in blood glucose levels as well as reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Empagliflozin was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo. CONCLUSION: The oral antidiabetes agent, empagliflozin, can be used as monotherapy or alongside other glucose-lowering treatments, including insulin, to treat T2DM."

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score). However, some patients have strokes despite a low predicted risk according to these scores. We designed the ABCDE+ score by adding the variables 'etiology' and ischaemic lesion visible on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) -'DWI-positivity'- to the ABCD-score. We hypothesized that this refinement increases the predictability of recurrent ischaemic events. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study amongst all consecutive TIA patients in a university hospital emergency department. Area under the computed receiver-operating curves (AUCs) were used to compare the predictive values of the scores with regard to the outcome stroke or recurrent TIA within 90 days. RESULTS: Amongst 248 patients, 33 (13.3%, 95%-CI 9.3-18.2%) had a stroke (n = 13) or a recurrent TIA (n = 20). Patients with recurrent ischaemic events more often had large-artery atherosclerosis as the cause for TIA (46% vs. 14%, P < 0.001) and positive DWI (61% vs. 35%; P = 0.01) compared with patients without recurrent events. Patients with and those without events did not differ with regard to age, clinical symptoms, duration, blood pressure, risk factors, and stroke preventive treatment. The comparison of AUCs [95%CI] showed superiority of the ABCDE+ score (0.67[0.55-0.75]) compared to the ABCD(2) -score (0.48[0.37-0.58]; P = 0.04) and a trend toward superiority compared to the ABCD-score (0.50[0.40-0.61]; P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: In TIA patients, the addition of the variables 'etiology' and 'DWI-positivity' to the ABCD-score seems to enhance the predictability of subsequent cerebral ischaemic events."

African Americans (AAs) have higher mortality rate from breast cancer than that of Caucasian Americans (CAs) even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for. To better understand the driving biological factors of this health disparity, we performed a comprehensive differential gene expression analysis, including subtype- and stage-specific analysis, using the breast cancer data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In total, 674 unique genes and other transcripts were found differentially expressed between these two populations. The numbers of differentially expressed genes between AA and CA patients increased in each stage of tumor progression: there were 26 in stage I, 161 in stage II, and 223 in stage III. Resistin, a gene that is linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and breast cancer, was expressed more than four times higher in AA tumors. An uncharacterized, long, non-coding RNA, LOC90784, was down-regulated in AA tumors, and its expression was inversely related to cancer stage and was the lowest in triple negative AA breast tumors. Network analysis showed increased expression of a majority of components in p53 and BRCA1 subnetworks in AA breast tumor samples, and members of the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways were also highly expressed. Higher gene expression diversity was observed in more advanced stage breast tumors suggesting increased genomic instability during tumor progression. Amplified resistin expression may indicate insulin-resistant type II diabetes and obesity are associated with AA breast cancer. Expression of LOC90784 may have a protective effect on breast cancer patients, and its loss, particularly in triple negative breast cancer, could be having detrimental effects. This work helps elucidate molecular mechanisms of breast cancer health disparity and identifies putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets such as resistin, and the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways for treating AA breast cancer patients."

Neoplastic diseases are proliferative disorders characterized by uncoordinated cell growth. Cellular proliferation follows an orderly progression through the cell cycle, which is governed by different cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Recently, CDK-inhibitors, which are a new class of small proteins involved in the negative regulation of the cell cycle, have been identified by virtue of their ability to interact physically with cyclin/CDK-complexes. As the genes encoding the CDK4- and CDK6-inhibitors (CDK4/6-inhibitors) p16INK4A/CDKN2/MTS1 and p15INK4B/MTS2 have been found to be altered in many cancer cell lines and primary neoplastic tissues, CDK-inhibitors in general and CDK4/6-inhibitors in particular are now a se: of candidate tumor suppressors. The p15 and p16 genes map to a region frequently deleted in lymphoid neoplasms. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to determine the role of CDK4/6-inhibitors in hematologic malignancies: This article will review alterations of components of the cell-cycle machinery in brief and summarize the role of the CDK4/6-inhibitors p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C and p19INK4D in leukemias and lymphomas."

However, genomic DNA sequencing combined to large rearrangement screening fails to detect a mutation in 5% of those cases. We report a family in which CCM lesions were discovered fortuitously because of the investigation of a developmental delay in a boy. Three members of the family on three generations had typical multiple CCM lesions and no clinical signs related to CCM. No mutation was detected using genomic DNA sequencing and quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). cDNA sequencing showed a 99-nucleotide insertion between exons 5 and 6 of CCM1, resulting from a mutation located deep into intron 5 (c.262+132_262+133del) that activates a cryptic splice site. This pseudoexon leads to a premature stop codon. These data highly suggest that deep intronic mutations explain part of the incomplete mutation detection rate in CCM patients and underline the importance of analyzing the cDNA to provide comprehensive CCM diagnostic tests. This kind of mutation may be responsible for apparent sporadic presentations due to a reduced penetrance."

They play a major role in the translocation machinery, pore formation, membrane anchoring and ion exchange. TMBs are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and vaccines. Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination, computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology of TMBs are important. RESULTS: Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences, respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, BOCTOPUS performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of 87%. Further, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct number of strands for 83% proteins in the dataset. BOCTOPUS might also help in reliable identification of TMBs by using it as an additional filter to methods specialized in this task.

RATIONALE: Mutations in the cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) have been linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations cause fatal ventricular arrhythmias in young individuals during \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the effects of a novel RyR2-G230C mutation and whether this mutation and RyR2-P2328S alter the sensitivity of the channel to luminal calcium (Ca(2+)). METHODS AND RESULTS: Functional characterizations of recombinant human RyR2-G230C channels were performed under conditions mimicking stress. Human RyR2 mutant channels were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells together with calstabin2. RyR2 channels were measured to examine the regulation of the channels by cytosolic versus luminal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+). A 50-year-old white man with repeated syncopal episodes after exercise had a cardiac arrest and harbored the mutation RyR2-G230C. cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated RyR2-G230C channels exhibited a significantly higher open probability at diastolic Ca(2+) concentrations, associated with a depletion of calstabin2. The luminal Ca(2+) sensitivities of RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels were WT-like. CONCLUSIONS: The RyR2-G230C mutant exhibits similar biophysical defects compared with previously characterized CPVT mutations: decreased binding of the stabilizing subunit calstabin2 and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation under conditions that simulate exercise, consistent with a \"leaky\" channel. Both RyR2-G230C and RyR2-P2328S channels exhibit normal luminal Ca(2+) activation. Thus, diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak caused by reduced calstabin2 binding and a leftward shift in the Ca(2+) dependence for activation by diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) is a common mechanism underlying CPVT."

The classic triad is infrequent and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more frequently. CTS is a rare complication of facial nerve paralysis characterised by inappropriate lacrimation on the side of the palsy in response to salivary stimuli. It results from aberrant reinnervation of the lacrimal gland by salivary parasympathetic fibres.

Agents Chemother. 39, 714-719]. Here, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursors. In vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction of Bacillus megaterium KM demonstrated that mersacidin did not prevent the synthesis of lipid II [undecaprenyl-diphosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-(pentapeptide)-N-ac ety lglucosamine] but specifically the subsequent conversion of this intermediate into polymeric nascent glycan strands by transglycosylation. Comparison with other inhibitors of transglycosylation shows that the effective concentration of mersacidin in vitro is in the range of that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin but 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the competitive enzyme inhibitor moenomycin. The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. This indicates that the molecular target site of mersacidin differs from that of vancomycin and that no cross-resistance exists between the two antibiotics."

To address this issue, we examined sensitivity to genotoxic agents in chicken DT40 cells lacking specific H1 variants. Among the six H1 variant mutants, only H1R(-/-) DT40 cells exhibited increased sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS). The MMS sensitivity of H1R(-/-) cells was not enhanced by inactivation of Rad54. H1R(-/-) DT40 cells also exhibited: (i) a reduction in gene targeting efficiencies, (ii) impaired sister chromatid exchange, and (iii) an accumulation of IR-induced chromosomal aberrations at the G2 phase, all of which indicate the involvement of H1R in the Rad54-mediated homologous recombination (HR) pathway. The mobility of H1R but not H1L in the nucleus decreased after MMS treatment and the repair of double-stranded breaks generated by I-SceI was unaffected in H1R(-/-) cells, suggesting that H1R integrates into HR-mediated repair pathways at the chromosome structure level. Together, these findings provide the first genetic evidence that a specific H1 variant plays a unique and important role in the DNA damage response in vertebrates."

However, TNF toxicity suggests a need for better-tolerated drugs. Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel cyclic inhibitor of alpha-V integrins, has both anti-angiogenic and direct anti-tumor effects and is a possible alternative to TNF in ILP. In this study, rats bearing a hind limb soft tissue sarcoma underwent ILP using different combinations of melphalan, TNF and cilengitide in the perfusate. Further groups had intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injections of cilengitide or saline 2 hr before and 3 hr after ILP. A 77% response rate (RR) was seen in animals treated i.p. with cilengitide and perfused with melphalan plus cilengitide. The RR was 85% in animals treated i.p. with cilengitide and ILP using melphalan plus both TNF and cilengitide. Both RRs were significantly greater than those seen with melphalan or cilengitide alone. Histopathology showed that high RRs were accompanied by disruption of tumor vascular endothelium and tumor necrosis. Compared with ILP using melphalan alone, the addition of cilengitide resulted in a three to sevenfold increase in melphalan concentration in tumor but not in muscle in the perfused limb. Supportive in vitro studies indicate that cilengitide both inhibits tumor cell attachment and increases endothelial permeability. Since cilengitide has low toxicity, these data suggest the agent is a good alternative to TNF in the ILP setting."

Escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair (NER) is responsible for removing bulky DNA adducts by dual incisions of the UvrABC endonuclease. Although the activity of the UvrAB complex which can induce DNA conformational change is employed in NER, the involvement of DNA topology and DNA topoisomerases remains unclear. We examined the effect of topoisomerase inhibitions on a NER in vivo system. The repair analysis of intracellular plasmid revealed that the DNA damage on positive supercoils generated by gyrase inhibition remained unrepaired, whereas the DNA damage was repaired in topoisomerase I mutants. These results suggest that DNA topology affects the NER process and the removal of positive supercoils by gyrase is vital for the efficiency of the E. coli NER system."

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification regulating various biological phenomena, including genomic imprinting and transposon silencing. It is known that methylation of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with paternally imprinted genes and of some repetitive elements occurs during male germ cell development in the mouse. We have performed a detailed methylation analysis of the paternally methylated DMRs (H19, Dlk1/Gtl2 and Rasgrf1), interspersed repeats [SineB1, intracisternal A particle (IAP) and Line1] and satellite repeats (major and minor) to determine the timing of this de novo methylation in male germ cells. Furthermore, we have examined the roles of the de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and related protein (Dnmt3L) in this process. We found that methylation of all DMRs and repeats occurred progressively in fetal prospermatogonia and was completed by the newborn stage. Analysis of newborn prospermatogonia from germline-specific Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b knockout mice revealed that Dnmt3a mainly methylates the H19 and Dlk1/Gtl2 DMRs and a short interspersed repeat SineB1. Both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were involved in the methylation of Rasgrf1 DMR and long interspersed repeats IAP and Line1. Only Dnmt3b was required for the methylation of the satellite repeats. These results indicate both common and differential target specificities of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in vivo. Finally, all these sequences showed moderate to severe hypomethylation in Dnmt3L-deficient prospermatogonia, indicating the critical function and broad specificity of this factor in de novo methylation."

The parasite has since been found to be capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals including humans making it one of the most successful parasitic organisms worldwide. The pathogenic potential of T. gondii was recognized in the 1920s and 1930s, in congenitally infected children presenting with the classic triad of symptoms, namely hydrocephalus, retinochoroiditis and encephalitis. In addition, around the same time T. gondii parasites were found to be associated with severe intraocular inflammation. In the 1980s, T. gondii emerged as a major cause of death in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, illustrating the importance of the immune system in controlling T. gondii infection. T. gondii was reported as a major cause of abortion in sheep in New Zealand in the 1950s, which raised questions about potential new transmission routes for the parasite. The discovery of the cat as the definitive host in the 1960s was a very important finding as it helped to complete our understanding of the parasite's life cycle, and the oocyst stage of T. gondii shed in the faeces of infected cats was found to be an important source of infection for many intermediate hosts and helped to explain infection in herbivorous animals and people with a vegetarian diet. In addition, this stage of the parasite was very robust and could survive in the environment, depending on the climatic conditions, for up to 12-18 months. Knowledge of the parasite's life cycle, transmission routes, risk groups and host immune responses has helped in the development of strategies to control the disease, reduce transmission of the parasite and limit environmental contamination."

Direct conversion of fibroblasts to induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) has great potential for regenerative medicine. Recent publications have reported significant progress, but the evaluation of reprogramming has relied upon non-functional measures such as flow cytometry for cardiomyocyte markers or GFP expression driven by a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter. The issue is one of practicality: the most stringent measures - electrophysiology to detect cell excitation and the presence of spontaneously contracting myocytes - are not readily quantifiable in the large numbers of cells screened in reprogramming experiments. However, excitation and contraction are linked by a third functional characteristic of cardiomyocytes: the rhythmic oscillation of intracellular calcium levels. We set out to optimize direct conversion of fibroblasts to iCMs with a quantifiable calcium reporter to rapidly assess functional transdifferentiation. We constructed a reporter system in which the calcium indicator GCaMP is driven by the cardiomyocyte-specific Troponin T promoter. Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors. HNGMT is also significantly more effective than previously published factor combinations for the transdifferentiation of adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts to iCMs. Quantification of calcium function is a convenient and effective means for the identification and evaluation of cardiomyocytes generated by direct reprogramming. Using this stringent outcome measure, we conclude that HNGMT produces iCMs more efficiently than previously published methods."

Triadin and junctin are integral sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins that form a macromolecular complex with the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) but their roles in skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis remain incompletely understood. Here we report that delivery of siRNAs specific for triadin or junctin into C2C12 skeletal myoblasts reduced the expression of triadin and junctin in 8-day-old myotubes by 80 and 100%, respectively. Knocking down either triadin or junctin in these cells reduced Ca2+ release induced by depolarization (10mM KCl) by 20-25%. Unlike triadin knockdown myotubes, junctin knockdown and junctin/triadin double knockdown myotubes also had reduced Ca2+ release induced by 400 microM 4-chloro-m-cresol, 10mM caffeine, 400 microM UTP, or 1 microM thapsigargin. Thus, knocking down junctin compromised the Ca2+ stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of these cells. Our subsequent studies showed that in junctin knockdown myotubes at least two sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins (RyR1 and skeletal muscle calsequestrin) were down-regulated while these proteins' mRNA expression was not affected. The results suggest that triadin has a role in facilitating KCl depolarization-induced Ca2+ release in contrast to junctin which has a role in maintaining sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store size in C2C12 myotubes."

The components of the replisome that preserve genomic stability by controlling the progression of eukaryotic DNA replication forks are poorly understood.

RPC components include the essential initiation and elongation factor, Cdc45, the checkpoint mediator Mrc1, the Tof1-Csm3 complex that allows replication forks to pause at protein-DNA barriers, the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) and Ctf4, which helps to establish sister chromatid cohesion. RPCs also interact with Mcm10 and topoisomerase I. During initiation, GINS is essential for a specific subset of RPC proteins to interact with MCM. GINS is also important for the normal progression of DNA replication forks, and we show that it is required after initiation to maintain the association between MCM and Cdc45 within RPCs."

We reviewed electrophysiological data in 20 patients with POEMS syndrome and 36 matched patients with CIDP to compare the electrophysiological features of POEMS syndrome and CIDP. Compared with CIDP controls, POEMS patients demonstrated (1) less prolonged distal motor latency and less reduced motor nerve and sensory nerve conduction velocities, (2) greater reduction of amplitudes of compound motor action potentials (CMAP) in distal stimulation, and similar reduction of amplitudes of CMAP in proximal stimulation, (3) similar reduction of amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) in median and ulnar nerves, and a greater reduction of amplitudes of SNAP in tibial and peroneal nerves, (4) less temporal dispersion, (5) less frequent conduction block, (6) more frequent neurogenic injury in the muscles of the upper and lower limbs, and more frequent neurogenic injury in the muscles of the lower than upper limbs, (7) similar F wave and H reflex abnormalities, and (8) less frequent skin sympathetic response abnormalities.

The first component is a C-terminal pattern typical of many integral beta-barrel proteins. The second component calculates an integral beta-barrel score of the sequence based on the extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of transmembrane beta-strands. The precision of the predictions was found to be 80% with a recall of 88% when tested on the proteins with SwissProt annotated subcellular localization in Escherichia coli K 12 (788 sequences) and Salmonella typhimurium (366 sequences). When tested on the predicted proteome of E.coli, BOMP found 103 of a total of 4346 polypeptide sequences to be possible integral beta-barrel proteins.

BACKGROUND: Certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., rofecoxib [Vioxx]) increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and should be avoided in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. Rates of cardiovascular disease are high and rising in many low- and middle-income countries. We studied the extent to which evidence on cardiovascular risk with NSAIDs has translated into guidance and sales in 15 countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data on the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular events with individual NSAIDs were derived from meta-analyses of randomised trials and controlled observational studies. Listing of individual NSAIDs on Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) was obtained from the World Health Organization. NSAID sales or prescription data for 15 low-, middle-, and high-income countries were obtained from Intercontinental Medical Statistics Health (IMS Health) or national prescription pricing audit (in the case of England and Canada). Three drugs (rofecoxib, diclofenac, etoricoxib) ranked consistently highest in terms of cardiovascular risk compared with nonuse. Naproxen was associated with a low risk. Diclofenac was listed on 74 national EMLs, naproxen on just 27. Rofecoxib use was not documented in any country. Diclofenac and etoricoxib accounted for one-third of total NSAID usage across the 15 countries (median 33.2%, range 14.7-58.7%). This proportion did not vary between low- and high-income countries. Diclofenac was by far the most commonly used NSAID, with a market share close to that of the next three most popular drugs combined. Naproxen had an average market share of less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Listing of NSAIDs on national EMLs should take account of cardiovascular risk, with preference given to low risk drugs. Diclofenac has a risk very similar to rofecoxib, which was withdrawn from worldwide markets owing to cardiovascular toxicity. Diclofenac should be removed from EMLs."

AIM: To report the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of a series of 15 adult patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 15 patients aged 52 \u00b1 17 years (40% males) diagnosed at our echocardiography laboratory between January 2001 and July 2010. RESULTS: The form of presentation was heart failure in 53% of subjects, syncope in 20%o, ventricular arrhythmias in 13%o and stroke in 7%>. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 66 \u00b1 11 mm and estimated ejection fraction was 27 \u00b1 10%>. Apical and/or mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle were involved in all the cases. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 40%o. The average follow-up was 19 months and no patient died during this period. Sixty seven percent of the patients had manifestations of heart failure, 27%o presented sustained ventricular arrhythmias and 20%> had atrial fibrillation or flutter, whereas 13%o had cerebral embolic events. An automated internal cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in 47%o of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Non-compaction cardiomyopathy is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity.

Proteins from decalcified rat bone were captured on a sclerostin-maltose binding protein (MBP) amylose column, or on a MBP amylose column. The columns were extensively washed with low ionic strength buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 1M sodium chloride.

Several previously unidentified full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase, gremlin-1, fetuin A, midkine, annexin A1 and A2, and collagen \u03b11, which have established roles in bone formation or resorption processes, were bound to the sclerostin-MBP amylose resin but not to the MBP amylose resin. Other full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as casein kinase II and secreted frizzled related protein 4 that modulate Wnt signaling were identified. Several peptides derived from proteins such as Phex, asporin and follistatin that regulate bone metabolism also bound sclerostin.

The glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptors alpha (GFRalpha) are cell surface bound glycoproteins that mediate interactions of the GDNF ligand family with the RET receptor. These interactions are crucial to the development of the kidney and some peripheral nerve lineages. In humans, mutations of RET or RET ligands are associated with the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) in which nerves and ganglia of the hind gut are absent. As the GFRalpha family are required for normal activation of the RET receptor, they are also candidates for a role in HSCR. The GFRA2 gene, which is required for the development of the myenteric nerve plexus, is an excellent candidate gene for HSCR. In this study, we cloned the human GFRA2 locus, characterized the gene structure, and compared it with other GFRA family members. We further investigated the GFRA2 gene for mutations in a panel of HSCR patients. GFRA2 has nine coding exons that are similar in size and organization to those of other GFRA family genes. We identified six sequence variants of GFRA2, four of which did not affect the amino acid sequence of the GFRalpha-2 protein. Two further changes that resulted in amino acid substitutions were found in exon 9 and were predicted to lie in the amino acid sequence encoding the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linkage signal of GFRalpha-2. There was no difference in frequency of any of the sequence variants between control and HSCR populations. Our data indicate that members of the GFRA gene family are closely related in intron/exon structure and in sequence. We have not detected any correlation between sequence variants of GFRA2 and the HSCR phenotype."

BACKGROUND: Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) constitute one of the smallest subgroups of sSMC in general. Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome. In 2008 we speculated that complex sSMC could be part of an underestimated entity. RESULTS: Here, the overall yet reported 412 complex sSMC are summarized. They constitute 8.4% of all yet in detail characterized sSMC cases. The majority of the complex sSMC is contributed by patients suffering from Emanuel syndrome (82%). Besides there are a der(22)t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.1) and a der(13)t(13;18)(q11;p11.21) or der(21)t(18;21)(p11.21;q11.1) = der(13 or 21)t(13 or 21;18) syndrome. The latter two represent another 2.6% and 2.2% of the complex sSMC-cases, respectively. The large majority of complex sSMC has a centric minute shape and derives from an acrocentric chromosome. Nonetheless, complex sSMC can involve material from each chromosomal origin. Most complex sSMC are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non-mosaic. Interestingly, there are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved. CONCLUSIONS: Complex sSMC need to be considered in diagnostics, especially in non-mosaic, centric minute shaped sSMC. As yet three complex-sSMC-associated syndromes are identified. As recurrent breakpoints in the complex sSMC were characterized, it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of sSMC. Overall, complex sSMC emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses, especially in patients with idiopathic mental retardation."

Possible causes for a normocytic hyperregeneratory anemia are beside an incomplete treatment of iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency or folic acid deficiency notably a hemolysis. After exclusion of other causes of hemolysis like immune hemolytic anemias, microangiopathic hemolytic anemias and hemoglobinopathies, an enzyme deficiency of erythrocytes should be considered. By far the most common form worldwide is the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency. In the most frequent variants of this disease hemolysis occurs only during stress, imposed for example by infection, \"oxidative\" drugs or after ingestion of fava beans. The most serious clinical complication of the Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency is the rarely observed neonatal icterus. Some enzyme variants can cause chronic hemolysis which is described as chronic nonsperocytic hemolytic anemia. This form of chronic anemia can also be caused by other enzyme deficiencies, most frequently by the Pyruvate kinase deficiency. All other deficiencies of glycolytic enzymes are even rarer. It should be noted that in some of these very rare forms neurological rather than hematological symptoms predominate the clinical syndrome. If there is suspicion, on the basis of clinical symptoms and/or familial history, diagnosis of an enzyme deficiency can be achieved relatively easy by measurement of the enzyme activity. Accurate diagnosis might be helpful in therapeutic decisions (e.g. splenectomy in certain forms) and it is essential for genetic counseling, since certain deficiencies are transmitted as autosomal recessive disorders (e.g. pyruvate kinase deficiency), while the most common form, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is linked to the X-chromosome."

Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. In this paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of CUTs. In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation. Dissection of a CUT terminator reveals a minimal element sufficient for Nrd1- and Nab3-directed termination. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome."

PURPOSE: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a developmental disorder caused by a failure of neural crest cells to migrate, proliferate, and/or differentiate during the enteric nervous system development. It presents a multifactorial, nonmendelian pattern of inheritance, with several genes playing some role in its pathogenesis. Its major susceptibility gene is the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase activating several key signaling pathways in the enteric nervous system development. Given the pivotal role of RET in HSCR, the genes encoding their ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN) are also good candidates for the disease. METHODS: We have performed a case-control study using Taqman technology to evaluate 10 polymorphisms within these genes, as well as haplotypes comprising them, as susceptibility factors for HSCR. RESULTS: No differences were found in the allelic frequencies of the variants or in the haplotype distribution between patients and controls. In addition, no particular association was detected of the variants/haplotypes to any demographic/clinical parameters within the group of patients. CONCLUSION: These data would be consistent with the lack of association between these polymorphisms and HSCR, although they do not permit to completely discard a possible role of other variants within these genes in the disease. Moreover, because the gene-by-gene approach does not take into account the polygenic nature of HSCR disease, it would be interesting to investigate sets of variants in many other different susceptibility loci described for HSCR, which may permit to consider possible interactions among susceptibility genes."

BACKGROUND: Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a treatment target in neurodegenerative illness and mood disorders that increases oxidative stress and predisposition toward apoptosis. Increased MAO-A levels in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) occur in rodent models of depressive behavior and human studies of depressed moods. Extreme dysphoria is common in borderline personality disorder (BPD), especially when severe, and the molecular underpinnings of severe BPD are largely unknown. We hypothesized that MAO-A levels in PFC and ACC would be highest in severe BPD and would correlate with symptom magnitude. METHODS: [(11)C] Harmine positron emission tomography measured MAO-A total distribution volume (MAO-A VT), an index of MAO-A density, in severe BPD subjects (n = 14), moderate BPD subjects (n = 14), subjects with a major depressive episode (MDE) only (n = 14), and healthy control subjects (n = 14). All subjects were female. RESULTS: Severe BPD was associated with greater PFC and ACC MAO-A VT compared with moderate BPD, MDE, and healthy control subjects (multivariate analysis of variance group effect: F6,102 = 5.6, p < .001). In BPD, PFC and ACC MAO-A VT were positively correlated with mood symptoms (PFC: r = .52, p = .005; ACC: r = .53, p = .004) and suicidality (PFC: r = .40, p = .037; ACC: r = .38, p = .046), while hippocampus MAO-A VT was negatively correlated with verbal memory (r = -.44, p = .023). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that elevated MAO-A VT is associated with multiple indicators of BPD severity, including BPD symptomatology, mood symptoms, suicidality, and neurocognitive impairment."

BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas. METHODS: The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation. RESULTS: Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSIONS: People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles. The limitations of the principles in predicting ethical decision making are discussed."

Therefore, a new functional taxonomy of breast cancer and new targets for therapeutic development are urgently needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we have analyzed the proteome of TNBC applying a high-throughput proteomics approach to routinely archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: We have been able to identify and quantify more than 1000 protein groups. Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1.

Lrictor(KO) mice had defects in insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation, leading to decreased phosphorylation of Akt substrates FoxO, GSK-3\u03b2, PRAS40, AS160, and Tsc2. Lrictor(KO) mice also manifest defects in insulin-activated mTORC1 activity, evidenced by decreased S6 kinase and Lipin1 phosphorylation. Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance of Lrictor(KO) mice could be fully rescued by hepatic expression of activated Akt2 or dominant negative FoxO1. However, in the absence of mTORC2, forced Akt2 activation was unable to drive hepatic lipogenesis. Thus, we have identified an Akt-independent relay from mTORC2 to hepatic lipogenesis that separates the effects of insulin on glucose and lipid metabolism."

          "context": "Bupropion for the treatment of nicotine withdrawal and craving. Over the past decade, bupropion has become a major pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in the Western world. Unlike other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, bupropion is a non-nicotine treatment. Compared with a placebo control, bupropion approximately doubles smoking quit rates. Most smoking cessation pharmacotherapies are thought to work, in part, by reducing nicotine withdrawal and craving. This article reviews preclinical, human laboratory and clinical trial studies of the effect of bupropion on nicotine withdrawal and craving. Preclinical studies demonstrate that in rats undergoing nicotine withdrawal, bupropion can dose-dependently lower changes in brain-reward threshold and somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal. Human laboratory studies have demonstrated that bupropion can alleviate some nicotine withdrawal symptoms, including depressed mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating and increased appetite. Moreover, bupropion has shown some efficacy in alleviating craving to smoke. Clinical trials of bupropion have offered mixed support of its ability to reduce nicotine withdrawal, weight gain during treatment and craving. Strong mediational evidence of bupropion's action through relief of withdrawal and craving in smoking cessation is growing. Greater understanding of the psychological mechanisms of bupropion action will likely be obtained through advances in the conceptualization and measurement of withdrawal and craving. Improvements in the efficacy of bupropion may be achieved through pharmacogenetic studies, with particular emphasis on its metabolites. Ultimately, the efficacy of bupropion may be augmented by combination with other agents that target withdrawal and craving through complementary neurobiological processes."

Lower limb lymphoscintigraphy confirmed lymphedema and duodenal biopsies lymphangiectasia. Hypoproteinemia, lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia were also noted. Treatment of lymphedema included low stretch bandaging and elastic stocking. No dietary management with a low-fat diet was added. Search for primary intestinal lymphangiectasia with biological parameters would be useful when primary lymphedema is present. Especially since primary intestinal lymphangiectasia may be complicated by occurrence of B cell lymphoma."

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genetic variation within genes related to the Toll-like receptor, inflammasome and interferon-\u03b3 pathways contributes to the differences in treatment response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In a retrospective case-case study, we assessed 23 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15 genes. We included 538 anti-TNF na\u00efve Danish RA patients from the nationwide DANBIO database. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to detect associations (p-value<0.05) between genotypes and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) treatment responses. False Discovery Rate corrections for multiple testing (q-value) and stratified analyses were performed to investigate association with individual therapies and IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) status. RESULTS: Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally associated with EULAR treatment response. Three of these were in weak to moderate linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms previously reported associated with anti-TNF treatment response. TLR5(rs5744174) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 1.7(1.1-2.5),p = 0.010,q = 0.46) and TLR1(rs4833095) homozygous variant carriers (OR = 2.8(1.1-7.4),p = 0.037,q = 0.46) had higher odds for a positive treatment response. NLRP3(rs10754558) variant allele carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 0.6(0.4-1.0),p = 0.045,q = 0.46) were more likely to have a negative treatment response. The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative for RF (OR = 6.2(2.4-16.3),p = 0.0002,q = 0.024). No other association withstood correction for multiple testing. Post hoc analyses showed that change in Patient Global score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and change in pain VAS were the main factors responsible for the association. CONCLUSIONS: We reproduced previously reported associations between genetic variation in the TLR10/1/6 gene cluster, TLR5, and NLRP3 loci and response to anti-TNF treatment in RA. Changes in VAS pain and patient global scores were the main contributors to the association found for TLR5. Furthermore, we identified other candidate genes that require replication in independent cohorts."

BACKGROUND: There are approximately 2 million adoptive parents in the United States and some struggle with depressive symptoms postplacement. We know little about personality traits that may be associated with depression in adoptive parents. OBJECTIVES: This study describes the relationships between personality traits, unmet expectations, and maternal postadoption depression. DESIGN: Adoptive mothers (N = 136) were surveyed for depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Analyses included correlations and a regression analysis between depressive symptoms and unmet expectations with the Five-Factor Model personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness to experience) as measured by the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. RESULTS: Both the CES-D and EPDS were significantly, negatively correlated with all five personality dimensions. Mothers whose expectations of themselves as parents matched pre- and postplacement were more likely to be emotionally stable and extraverted. Approximately 36% of the variance in depressive symptoms was explained by personality traits (emotional stability: p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The postadoption period is a crucial time of transition for mothers and their children. Maternal emotional stability, depressive symptoms, and unmet expectations may affect this period. Mothers who are lower in emotional stability may be at risk for postadoptive depressive symptoms. In planning and providing innovative care that promotes positive mother-child relationships, nurses should assess adoptive mothers for depressive symptoms, emotional stability, and unmet expectations."

OBJECTIVE: To review the literature pertaining to the efficacy of alteplase for restoration of patency of occluded venous and dialysis catheters in pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted and cross-referenced with an EMBASE search through November 2012. Search terms included alteplase, tissue plasminogen activator, and catheter. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Search results were limited to humans, English language, and ages from neonates to 18 years. Pertinent studies discussing efficacy of alteplase for restoration of occluded venous or dialysis catheter function were included. Case reports, review articles, and studies that specified inclusion of hemophilia patients or more than 75% of children with malignancy were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fibrinolytics are the drug class of choice for restoration of patency (defined as the ability to withdraw a blood sample) of thrombus-occluded catheters. The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children. Alteplase doses of 0.5-2 mg instilled into the lumen of a CVC with dwell times ranging from 30 to more than 240 minutes plus the potential for repeat dosing were reported. Overall efficacy ranged from approximately 50% to 90%, with greater efficacy generally reported with larger doses and longer dwell times. Alteplase doses of 2-2.5 mg with dwell times of 60-120 minutes were observed in 2 studies of occluded peritoneal or hemodialysis catheters, in which efficacy was reported in 57-100% of cases. Limitations of current studies of alteplase for catheter occlusion in children include small study populations and relative lack of pediatric-specific prospective trials. CONCLUSIONS: Alteplase appears to show efficacy for treatment of thrombus-related venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients; however, data regarding its use in occluded dialysis catheters are limited."

INTRODUCTION: Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are used in sudden cardiac death (SCD) prevention in high-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), long-term results as well as precise risk stratification are discussed in a limited number of reports. The aim of the study was to assess the incidence of ICD intervention in HCM patients with relation to clinical risk profile. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 104 consecutive patients with HCM implanted in a single center. The mean age of study population was 35.6 (SD, 16.2) years with the average follow-up of 4.6 (SD, 2.6) years. ICD was implanted for secondary (n = 26) and primary (n = 78) prevention of SCD. In the secondary prevention group, 14 patients (53.8%) experienced at least 1 appropriate device intervention (7.9%/year). In the primary prevention (PP) group appropriate ICD discharges occurred in 13 patients (16.7%) and intervention rate was 4.0%/year. Nonsustained VT was the only predictive risk factor (RF) for an appropriate ICD intervention in the PP (positive predictive value 22%, negative predictive value 96%). No significant difference was observed in the incidence of appropriate ICD discharges between PP patients with 1, 2, or more RF. Complications of the treatment included: inappropriate shocks (33.7%), lead dysfunction (12.5%), and infections: 4.8% of patients. Four patients died during follow-up. CONCLUSION: ICD therapy is effective in SCD prevention in patients with HCM, although the complication rate is significant. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia seems to be the most predictive RF for appropriate device discharges. Number of RF did not impact the incidence of appropriate ICD interventions."

OBJECTIVE: We report a detailed description of a family affected by a hereditary multisystem disorder associated with moyamoya syndrome. METHODS: In this family case report, we evaluated 9 members of the same family originating from Algeria. Investigations included neuroimaging, cardiologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, hormonal testing, hemoglobin electrophoresis, chromosomal karyotyping, muscle biopsy for morphology, immunohistochemistry and enzyme assays, mtDNA mutation screening, and haplotype analysis of 2 loci previously linked to moyamoya, on chromosomes 10 (ACTA2) and 17. RESULTS: Five males related through a maternal lineage were affected, suggesting an X-linked inheritance. Four of them had symptomatic moyamoya syndrome with an onset of acute neurologic manifestations between 4 and 32 years. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, azoospermia, short stature of postnatal onset (-2 to -4 SD in adulthood), premature graying of hair, and dysmorphism were present in all patients. The other features of the disease included early cataract in 4, dilated cardiomyopathy in 3, and partial growth hormone deficiency in 2 members. Muscle biopsy data did not reveal signs of a mitochondrial disorder. All conditions known to be associated with moyamoya syndrome such as Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and sickle cell disease were excluded. We also excluded linkage to the 2 loci previously reported to be involved in autosomal dominant syndromic and nonsyndromic moyamoya. Carrier females had normal phenotype and clinical history.

Their main role is to control fluid flow and defects in their differentiation are implicated in many human disorders, such as hydrocephalus, accompanied by defects in adult neurogenesis and mucociliary disorder in the airway system. Here we show that Mcidas, which is mutated in human mucociliary clearance disorder, and GemC1 (Gmnc or Lynkeas), previously implicated in cell cycle progression, are key regulators of multiciliated ependymal cell generation in the mouse brain. Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that Mcidas and GemC1 are sufficient and necessary for cell fate commitment and differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated ependymal cells. Furthermore, we show that GemC1 and Mcidas operate in hierarchical order, upstream of Foxj1 and c-Myb transcription factors, which are known regulators of ependymal cell generation, and that Notch signaling inhibits GemC1 and Mcidas function. Our results suggest that Mcidas and GemC1 are key players in the generation of multiciliated ependymal cells of the adult neurogenic niche."

Recent clinical studies have raised the clinically important question of the relationship between dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and prostate cancer (PCa) progression. The significance of DHT or 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) in PCa development and progression has not yet been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to determine whether the initiation of DNA replication was influenced by DHT in PCa. Three cell lines were used. LNCaP: a human PCa cell line that exhibits androgen-dependent proliferation, C4-2: a human PCa cell line that exhibits androgen-independent proliferation, and C4-2AT6: a castration resistant prostate cancer cell line. Two 5ARIs, finasteride and dutasteride, were used. We examined the mRNA expression of the components of pre-replication complex (Pre-RC), CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7. DHT induced cell proliferation of LNCaP accompanied by significantly increased CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7 expression. In contrast to LNCaP, DHT inhibited cell proliferation in C4-2AT6 cells accompanied by decreased expression of CDC6, CDT1, and MCM2-7. These reverse effects resemble the effects of 5ARIs in Pre-RC. Treatment with finasteride or dutasteride inhibited CDC6 expression in LNCaP, but both 5ARIs induced CDC6 expression in C4-2 and C4-2AT6 cells.These results indicate that DHT showed reversal effects on PCa cell proliferation among prostate cancer cells based on androgen-dependence, accompanied by regulation of the initiation of DNA replication. 5ARIs may modulate the DNA replication system in someaggressive PCa through up-regulation of CDC6 expression."

The 8p11-p12 amplicon occurs in approximately 15% of breast cancers in aggressive luminal B-type tumors. Previously, we identified WHSC1L1 as a driving oncogene from this region. Here, we demonstrate that over-expression of WHSC1L1 is linked to over-expression of ER\u03b1 in SUM-44 breast cancer cells and in primary human breast cancers. Knock-down of WHSC1L1, particularly WHSC1L1-short, had a dramatic effect on ESR1 mRNA and ER\u03b1 protein levels. SUM-44\u00a0cells do not require exogenous estrogen for growth in\u00a0vitro; however, they are dependent on ER\u03b1 expression, as ESR1 knock-down or exposure to the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant resulted in growth inhibition. ChIP-Seq experiments utilizing ER\u03b1 antibodies demonstrated extensive ER\u03b1 binding to chromatin in SUM-44\u00a0cells under estrogen-free conditions. ER\u03b1 bound to ERE and FOXA1 motifs under estrogen-free conditions and regulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Short-term treatment with estradiol enhanced binding of ER\u03b1 to chromatin and influenced expression of many of the same genes to which ER\u03b1 was bound under estrogen-free conditions. Finally, knock-down of WHSC1L1 in SUM-44\u00a0cells resulted in loss of ER\u03b1 binding to chromatin under estrogen-free conditions, which was restored upon exposure to estradiol. These results indicate the SUM-44\u00a0cells are a good model of a subset of luminal B breast cancers that have the 8p11-p12 amplicon, over-express WHSC1L1, and over-express ER\u03b1, but are independent of estrogen for binding to chromatin and regulation of gene expression. Breast cancers such as these, that are dependent on ER\u03b1 activity but independent of estradiol, are a major cause of breast cancer mortality."

BACKGROUND: The melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene regulates human pigmentation and is highly polymorphic in populations of European origins. The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between MC1R variants and the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and to investigate whether risk estimates differed by phenotypic characteristics. METHODS: Data on 3527 NMSC cases and 9391 controls were gathered through the M-SKIP Project, an international pooled-analysis on MC1R, skin cancer and phenotypic characteristics. We calculated summary odds ratios (SOR) with random-effect models, and performed stratified analyses. RESULTS: Subjects carrying at least one MC1R variant had an increased risk of NMSC overall, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): SOR (95%CI) were 1.48 (1.24-1.76), 1.39 (1.15-1.69) and 1.61 (1.35-1.91), respectively. All of the investigated variants showed positive associations with NMSC, with consistent significant results obtained for V60L, D84E, V92M, R151C, R160W, R163Q and D294H: SOR (95%CI) ranged from 1.42 (1.19-1.70) for V60L to 2.66 (1.06-6.65) for D84E variant. In stratified analysis, there was no consistent pattern of association between MC1R and NMSC by skin type, but we consistently observed higher SORs for subjects without red hair. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled-analysis highlighted a role of MC1R variants in NMSC development and suggested an effect modification by red hair colour phenotype."

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of clinical conditions, including central obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. The long-term inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction associated with MetS may contribute to osteoarthritic processes leading up to total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The purpose of this study was to investigate levels of metabolic biomarkers and the prevalence of MetS in patients undergoing TJA. METHODS: Under IRB approval, citrated plasma samples were collected from 41 patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) preoperatively and day 1 postoperatively. Control group consisted of 25 healthy human plasma samples (female and male, 18-35 years old) purchased from George King Biomedical Inc. (Overland Park, KS, USA). Samples were profiled for c-peptide, ferritin, IL-6, insulin, resistin, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1a, leptin, and PAI-1 using metabolic biochips purchased from RANDOX Co. (Antrim, Northern Ireland). NCEP/ATP III guidelines were used to evaluate which patients met MetS criteria. RESULTS: Levels of IL-6, resistin, TNF-a, IL-1a, leptin, and PAI-1 were significantly elevated in patients undergoing TJA compared to normal. C-peptide and insulin were both decreased in TJA compared to normal. No significance was found when comparing TJA to normal for ferritin. TNF\u03b1 was significantly lower in TJA+MetS compared to TJA-MetS, while other biomarkers showed no difference in TJA\u00b1MetS populations. Insulin & c-peptide both showed a significant decrease in TJA-MetS compared to normal, but levels in TJA+MetS patients were not significantly different from controls. Resistin showed significant increases in TJA+MetS vs. normal, but not in TJA-MetS vs. normal. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the differing metabolic profile seen in patients undergoing TJA suggest ongoing metabolic dysfunction. Insulin and c-peptide patterns among the different test groups hint toward a complex and dysfunctional metabolic process involved, with leptin and underlying insulin resistance playing a role. Increased resistin in TJA+MetS, but not in TJA-MetS, compared to normal, suggests that while elevated resistin levels may be associated with the osteoarthritic process, levels are further attenuated by MetS, which is highly prevalent in this population. Increased TNF\u03b1 in TJA-MetS compared to TJA+MetS may be an artifact of differing sample populations or a true complication of the complex pathophysiology and medical regimen seen in patients with both OA and MetS. The lack of difference seen in the remaining biomarkers suggest that having MetS as a comorbidity does not contribute to the elevated levels seen in patients undergoing TJA."

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Choosing appropriate surgical patients in the setting of spinal metastases can be challenging. Existing scoring systems focus primarily on patient selection or operative techniques. These scores are limited in their capacity to predict postoperative survival. PURPOSE: The aim was to model survival after spine surgery for metastastic disease. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective multicenter study. PATIENT SAMPLE: All patients who had undergone surgery for the treatment of metastatic spinal disease at one of four tertiary care centers between 2007 and 2013 were included. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome measure was 1-year survival after surgery. METHODS: Demographic, medical, oncologic, surgical, and survival data were abstracted from medical records. The effect of predictor variables on survival was evaluated alone and in combination using stepwise logistic regression. Multivariable logistic regression was subsequently used to adjust for confounders. A predictive score was then developed and compared against that of the modified Bauer score alone in terms of prognosticating 1-year survival after surgery. RESULTS: In the time period under investigation, 318 patients underwent surgical intervention for metastastic disease involving the spine, with 307 having data available for analysis. The survival rate at 1 year was 48% (n=142), with a median survival of 10 months. In final adjusted analysis, preoperative modified Bauer score (odds ratio [OR] 3.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80-5.01; p<.001), ambulatory status (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.48-4.14; p=.001), and serum albumin (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.66-4.72; p<.001) were all independent predictors of 1-year survival. The most parsimonious model weighted the modified Bauer score with 2 points and intact ambulatory status and normal serum albumin level with 1 point each, with a ceiling score of 3. The final model using the predictive score was able to explain 74% of the variation in 1-year survival. In contrast, the modified Bauer score alone was only able to explain 64% of the variation in 1-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of including factors related to the overall health of a patient, in addition to parameters surrounding their cancer diagnosis, to better prognosticate survival. Our predictive score performed better than the modified Bauer alone and may be used to predict survival after surgical intervention for metastatic disease. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III."

BACKGROUND: Hemolytic uremic syndrome consists of a triad of acquired hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure. AIM: Our objectives were to determine epidemiology, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to determine the relationship between the complement protein deficit and aHUS in the Tunisian population. METHODS: We studied retrospectively four cases of atypical HUS in adults admitted in the Nephrology Department of Fattouma Bourguiba Universitary Hospital in Monastir between 2000 and 2008. RESULTS: Three patients had renal failure that required dialysis. One of them received kidney transplantation with no further recurrence of aHUS. Three patients had normal C3, C4, CFH, and FB levels, and in all patients anti-FH autoantibodies were absent. The kidney biopsy of one patient showed in addition to lupus glomerulonephritis histological findings consistent with TMA. A decrease in C3, C4 and CFH levels in this patient was found both before and after the cure. CONCLUSION: Nephrologists should be aware of autoimmune conditions and genetic abnormalities of the complement regulatory genes as possible pathogenic mechanisms in atypical HUS patients."

The Dnmt3 family of de novo DNA methyltransferases has recently been characterized in animals. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. The N termini of these methyltransferases contain a series of ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. UBA domains are found in several ubiquitin pathway proteins and in DNA repair enzymes such as Rad23, and they may be involved in ubiquitin binding. The presence of UBA domains provides a possible link between DNA methylation and ubiquitin/proteasome pathways."

In the present study, the isolation and characterization of two distinct cDNAs that code for carrot DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNA-METase) are reported. The screening of a cDNA library with a carrot genomic DNA fragment, previously obtained by PCR using degenerate primers, has led to the isolation of clones that belong to two distinct classes of genes (Met1 and Met2) which differ in sequence and size. Met1-5 and Met2-21 derived amino acid sequences are more than 85% identical for most of the polypeptide and completely diverge at the N-terminus. The larger size of the Met2-21 cDNA is due to the presence of nearly perfect fivefold repeat of a 171 bp sequence present only once in the Met1-5 cDNA. Northern and in situ hybridization analyses with young carrot plants and somatic embryos indicate that both genes are maximally expressed in proliferating cells (suspension cells, meristems and leaf primordia), but differ quantitatively and spatially in their mode of expression. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit using fusion proteins corresponding to the regulatory and catalytic regions of the most highly expressed gene (Met1-5). In nuclear carrot extracts, both antibodies were found to recognize a band of about 200 kDa along with some additional bands of lower size. These results provide the first direct demonstration that DNA-METases of a higher eukaryote are encoded by a gene family."

African Americans (AAs) have higher mortality rate from breast cancer than that of Caucasian Americans (CAs) even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for. To better understand the driving biological factors of this health disparity, we performed a comprehensive differential gene expression analysis, including subtype- and stage-specific analysis, using the breast cancer data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In total, 674 unique genes and other transcripts were found differentially expressed between these two populations. The numbers of differentially expressed genes between AA and CA patients increased in each stage of tumor progression: there were 26 in stage I, 161 in stage II, and 223 in stage III. Resistin, a gene that is linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and breast cancer, was expressed more than four times higher in AA tumors. An uncharacterized, long, non-coding RNA, LOC90784, was down-regulated in AA tumors, and its expression was inversely related to cancer stage and was the lowest in triple negative AA breast tumors. Network analysis showed increased expression of a majority of components in p53 and BRCA1 subnetworks in AA breast tumor samples, and members of the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways were also highly expressed. Higher gene expression diversity was observed in more advanced stage breast tumors suggesting increased genomic instability during tumor progression. Amplified resistin expression may indicate insulin-resistant type II diabetes and obesity are associated with AA breast cancer. Expression of LOC90784 may have a protective effect on breast cancer patients, and its loss, particularly in triple negative breast cancer, could be having detrimental effects. This work helps elucidate molecular mechanisms of breast cancer health disparity and identifies putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets such as resistin, and the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling pathways for treating AA breast cancer patients."

BACKGROUND: We sought to identify preoperative factors significantly correlated with survival. We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems. Moreover, we suggest modified criteria for selecting treatment strategies. METHODS: In total, the outcomes of 112 patients with spinal metastasis who underwent surgery between January 2006 and June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The validity of the prognostic scores was assessed on the basis of their correlation with survival. For various primary malignancies, new scoring criteria were applied in each system according to the survival results obtained in this study. Each revised scoring system was adjusted with a similar principle of scoring as described previously. Patient survival according to each preoperative factor was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive value of each scoring system was evaluated by the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The interval from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to that of spinal metastasis (p = 0.023) and the interval from the diagnosis of spinal metastasis to surgery (p = 0.039) were significantly correlated with survival. Regarding Tokuhashi scores, the correlation coefficient was 0.790 before adjustment (p = 0.001) and 0.853 after adjustment (p < 0.001). For Tomita scores, the correlation coefficient was -0.994 (p < 0.001) both before and after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores.

RIP1 is an adaptor kinase originally identified as being able to associate with TNFR1 and Fas, and is later shown to be involved in signaling induced by TLRs. Major signaling pathways regulated by RIP1 include necroptosis, apoptosis, and pro-survival/inflammation NF-\u03baB activation. Previous studies show that RIP1 deficiency has no effect on mouse embryogenesis, but blocks postnatal development. This phenotype could not readily be explained, since mice lacking TNFR1, Fas, or TLRs show no apparent developmental defect. Certain types of RIP1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. However, in our previous study, deletion of the apoptotic adaptor protein, FADD, provides marginal improvement of postnatal development of rip1 (-/-) mice. Remarkably, the current data shows that haploid insufficiency of RIP3, a known mediator of necroptosis, allowed survival of rip1 (-/-) fadd (-/-) mice beyond weaning age, although the resulting rip1(-/-)fadd(-/-) rip3(+/-) mice were significant smaller in size and weight. Moreover, complete absence of RIP3 further improved postnatal development of the resulting rip1 (-/-) fadd (-/-) rip3 (-/-) mice, which display normal size and weight. In such triple knockout (TKO) mice, lymphocytes underwent normal development, but progressively accumulated as mice age. This lymphoproliferative (lpr) disease in TKO mice is, however, less severe than that of fadd(-/-)rip3 (-/-) double knockout mice. In total, the data show that the postnatal developmental defect in rip1 (-/-) mice is due in part to FADD-mediated apoptosis as well as RIP3-dependent necroptosis. Moreover, the function of RIP1 contributes to development of lpr diseases."

A genome-wide association study of 785,720 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed, comparing 72 Japanese MMD patients with 45 Japanese controls and resulting in a strong association of chromosome 17q25-ter with MMD risk. This result was further confirmed by a locus-specific association study using 335 SNPs in the 17q25-ter region. A single haplotype consisting of seven SNPs at the RNF213 locus was tightly associated with MMD (P = 5.3 \u00d7 10(-10)). RNF213 encodes a really interesting new gene finger protein with an AAA ATPase domain and is abundantly expressed in spleen and leukocytes. An RNA in situ hybridization analysis of mouse tissues indicated that mature lymphocytes express higher levels of Rnf213 mRNA than their immature counterparts. Mutational analysis of RNF213 revealed a founder mutation, p.R4859K, in 95% of MMD families, 73% of non-familial MMD cases and 1.4% of controls; this mutation greatly increases the risk of MMD (P = 1.2 \u00d7 10(-43), odds ratio = 190.8, 95% confidence interval = 71.7-507.9). Three additional missense mutations were identified in the p.R4859K-negative patients. These results indicate that RNF213 is the first identified susceptibility gene for MMD."

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) has been challenging over decades, mostly due to a number of difficulties associated with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), which have been the most effective stroke prevention treatment for a long time. The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran) and oral direct inhibitors of factor Xa (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban) have emerged recently as an alternative to VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. These drugs act rapidly, and have a predictable and stable dose-related anticoagulant effect with a few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The novel oral anticoagulants are used in fixed doses with no need for regular laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation intensity. However, each of these drugs has distinct pharmacological properties that could influence optimal use in clinical practice. The following phase 3 randomized trials with novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for stroke prevention in AF have been completed: the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) trial with dabigatran, the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial with rivaroxaban, and the Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolism Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial with apixaban. Moreover, the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to prevent Strokes (AVERROES) trial included patients with AF who have failed or were unsuitable for warfarin, and compared apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Overall, apixaban has two large trials for stroke prevention in AF showing benefits not only over warfarin, but also over aspirin among those patients who have failed or refused warfarin. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin in the reduction of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality, with a similar reduction in the rate of ischemic stroke and better tolerability. When compared with aspirin in the AVERROES trial, apixaban was associated with more effective reduction of stroke, a similar risk of major bleeding, and better tolerability. In this review article, the authors summarize the current knowledge on novel oral anticoagulants and discuss the clinical aspects of their use for stroke prevention in AF, with particular emphasis on apixaban."

Citrate synthase (gltA) is a key enzyme in Geobacter central metabolism that controls flux into the TCA cycle. Here, we utilize shotgun proteomic methods to demonstrate that the measurement of gltA peptides can be used to track Geobacter activity and strain evolution during in situ biostimulation. Abundances of conserved gltA peptides tracked Fe(III) reduction and changes in U(VI) concentrations during biostimulation, whereas changing patterns of unique peptide abundances between samples suggested sample-specific strain shifts within the Geobacter population. Abundances of unique peptides indicated potential differences at the strain level between Fe(III)-reducing populations stimulated during in situ biostimulation experiments conducted a year apart at the Rifle IFRC. These results offer a novel technique for the rapid screening of large numbers of proteomic samples for Geobacter species and will aid monitoring of subsurface bioremediation efforts that rely on metal reduction for desired outcomes."

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification regulating various biological phenomena, including genomic imprinting and transposon silencing. It is known that methylation of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with paternally imprinted genes and of some repetitive elements occurs during male germ cell development in the mouse. We have performed a detailed methylation analysis of the paternally methylated DMRs (H19, Dlk1/Gtl2 and Rasgrf1), interspersed repeats [SineB1, intracisternal A particle (IAP) and Line1] and satellite repeats (major and minor) to determine the timing of this de novo methylation in male germ cells. Furthermore, we have examined the roles of the de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and related protein (Dnmt3L) in this process. We found that methylation of all DMRs and repeats occurred progressively in fetal prospermatogonia and was completed by the newborn stage. Analysis of newborn prospermatogonia from germline-specific Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b knockout mice revealed that Dnmt3a mainly methylates the H19 and Dlk1/Gtl2 DMRs and a short interspersed repeat SineB1. Both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were involved in the methylation of Rasgrf1 DMR and long interspersed repeats IAP and Line1. Only Dnmt3b was required for the methylation of the satellite repeats. These results indicate both common and differential target specificities of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in vivo. Finally, all these sequences showed moderate to severe hypomethylation in Dnmt3L-deficient prospermatogonia, indicating the critical function and broad specificity of this factor in de novo methylation."

UNLABELLED: Cell division in bacteria is driven by a cytoskeletal ring structure, the Z ring, composed of polymers of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ. Z-ring formation must be tightly regulated to ensure faithful cell division, and several mechanisms that influence the positioning and timing of Z-ring assembly have been described. Another important but as yet poorly understood aspect of cell division regulation is the need to coordinate division with cell growth and nutrient availability. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that cell division is intimately linked to central carbon metabolism in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We showed that a deletion of the gene encoding pyruvate kinase (pyk), which produces pyruvate in the final reaction of glycolysis, rescues the assembly defect of a temperature-sensitive ftsZ mutant and has significant effects on Z-ring formation in wild-type B.\u00a0subtilis cells. Addition of exogenous pyruvate restores normal division in the absence of the pyruvate kinase enzyme, implicating pyruvate as a key metabolite in the coordination of bacterial growth and division. Our results support a model in which pyruvate levels are coupled to Z-ring assembly via an enzyme that actually metabolizes pyruvate, the E1\u03b1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase. We have shown that this protein localizes over the nucleoid in a pyruvate-dependent manner and may stimulate more efficient Z-ring formation at the cell center under nutrient-rich conditions, when cells must divide more frequently. IMPORTANCE: How bacteria coordinate cell cycle processes with nutrient availability and growth is a fundamental yet unresolved question in microbiology. Recent breakthroughs have revealed that nutritional information can be transmitted directly from metabolic pathways to the cell cycle machinery and that this can serve as a mechanism for fine-tuning cell cycle processes in response to changes in environmental conditions. Here we identified a novel link between glycolysis and cell division in Bacillus\u00a0subtilis. We showed that pyruvate, the final product of glycolysis, plays an important role in maintaining normal division. Nutrient-dependent changes in pyruvate levels affect the function of the cell division protein FtsZ, most likely by modifying the activity of an enzyme that metabolizes pyruvate, namely, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1\u03b1. Ultimately this system may help to coordinate bacterial division with nutritional conditions to ensure the survival of newborn cells."

This updated case report of one of the originally described patients with Carney's triad highlights several clinically important features of this unusual syndrome: (1) the multicentricity of both the paragangliomas and the epithelioid leiomyosarcomas, (2) the often indolent progression of metastatic leiomyosarcoma, (3) the potential for late recurrences, and (4) the importance of distinguishing intra-adrenal from periadrenal catecholamine-producing tumors (paragangliomas). Localization of paragangliomas is facilitated by two relatively new techniques--131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning (a scintigraphic technique with high specificity for catecholamine-producing tumors) and two-dimensional echocardiography (which can noninvasively localize and demonstrate the anatomic relationships of aorticopulmonary paragangliomas). In patients with this syndrome, new or recurrent tumors frequently manifest after unusually long asymptomatic intervals. We outline an approach for continued follow-up of patients with one or more of the three neoplasms that constitute the syndrome.

As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug. Because warfarin undergoes hepatic metabolism and is highly protein bound, it is particularly prone to drug interactions; in addition, its relatively narrow therapeutic window places patients at risk of either hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Although warfarin's interactions with other drugs have long been studied, the most recent review of the literature of warfarin's interactions with psychotropics was over a decade ago. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature documenting the interaction between warfarin and psychotropics, with a focus on interactions mediated through the cytochrome P450 system and protein binding. A search of the MEDLINE database was performed, and reports of warfarin interactions with psychotropics were identified. The results suggest that interactions between warfarin and psychotropic drugs are important and likely underrecognized. They also have notable implications for both safety and drug compliance. When certain psychotropics are started or discontinued in patients receiving warfarin therapy, or when warfarin is introduced to a patient receiving a stable dose of a psychotropic, clinicians should monitor a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) closely to ensure it remains within therapeutic range. Psychotropics that pose a particular risk of increasing the INR when used with warfarin include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, quetiapine, and valproic acid. Psychotropics that may significantly decrease the INR when used with warfarin include trazodone, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, and the polycyclic aromatic carbons in tobacco cigarettes; however, nicotine itself, as in nicotine replacement strategies, is not known to alter warfarin's anticoagulant effect. In certain cases, the need for anticoagulation may also necessitate switching to a different psychotropic."

BACKGROUND: Proliferation markers and profiles have been recommended for guiding the choice of systemic treatments for breast cancer. However, the best molecular marker or test to use has not yet been identified. We did this study to identify factors that drive proliferation and its associated features in breast cancer and assess their association with clinical outcomes and response to chemotherapy. METHODS: We applied an artificial neural network-based integrative data mining approach to data from three cohorts of patients with breast cancer (the Nottingham discovery cohort (n=171), Uppsala cohort (n=249), and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium [METABRIC] cohort; n=1980). We then identified the genes with the most effect on other genes in the resulting interactome map. Sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) featured prominently in our interactome map of proliferation and we chose to take it forward in our analysis on the basis of its fundamental role in the function and dynamic regulation of mitotic spindles, mitotic progression, and chromosome segregation fidelity. We investigated the clinicopathological relevance of SPAG5 gene copy number aberrations, mRNA transcript expression, and protein expression and analysed the associations of SPAG5 copy number aberrations, transcript expression, and protein expression with breast cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, pathological complete response, and residual cancer burden in the Nottingham discovery cohort, Uppsala cohort, METABRIC cohort, a pooled untreated lymph node-negative cohort (n=684), a multicentre combined cohort (n=5439), the Nottingham historical early stage breast cancer cohort (Nottingham-HES; n=1650), Nottingham early stage oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT; n=697), the Nottingham anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (Nottingham-NeoACT; n=200), the MD Anderson taxane plus anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (MD Anderson-NeoACT; n=508), and the multicentre phase 2 neoadjuvant clinical trial cohort (phase 2 NeoACT; NCT00455533; n=253). FINDINGS: In the METABRIC cohort, we detected SPAG5 gene gain or amplification at the Ch17q11.2 locus in 206 (10%) of 1980 patients overall, 46 (19%) of 237 patients with a PAM50-HER2 phenotype, and 87 (18%) of 488 patients with PAM50-LumB phenotype.

In multivariable analysis, high SPAG5 transcript and SPAG5 protein expression were associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival at 10 years compared with lower concentrations (Uppsala: HR 1\u00b762, 95% CI 1\u00b703-2\u00b753, p=0\u00b7036; METABRIC: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b702-1\u00b758, p=0\u00b7034; untreated lymph node-negative cohort: 2\u00b734, 1\u00b724-4\u00b742, p=0\u00b70090; and Nottingham-HES: 1\u00b773, 1\u00b723-2\u00b746, p=0\u00b70020). In patients with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer with high SPAG5 protein expression, anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy increased breast cancer-specific survival overall compared with that for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (Nottingham-oestrogen receptor-negative-ACT cohort: HR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b720-0\u00b760, p=0\u00b70010). Multivariable analysis showed high SPAG5 transcript concentrations to be independently associated with longer distant relapse-free survival after receiving taxane plus anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: HR 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7031). In multivariable analysis, both high SPAG5 transcript and high SPAG5 protein concentrations were independent predictors for a higher proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response after combination cytotoxic chemotherapy (MD Anderson-NeoACT: OR 1\u00b771, 95% CI, 1\u00b707-2\u00b774, p=0\u00b7024; Nottingham-ACT: 8\u00b775, 2\u00b742-31\u00b762, p=0\u00b70010). INTERPRETATION: SPAG5 is a novel amplified gene on Ch17q11.2 in breast cancer. The transcript and protein products of SPAG5 are independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers that might have clinical utility as biomarkers for combination cytotoxic chemotherapy sensitivity, especially in oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: The four principles of Beauchamp and Childress--autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice--have been extremely influential in the field of medical ethics, and are fundamental for understanding the current approach to ethical assessment in health care. This study tests whether these principles can be quantitatively measured on an individual level, and then subsequently if they are used in the decision making process when individuals are faced with ethical dilemmas. METHODS: The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used as a tool for the measurement of the principles. Four scenarios, which involved conflicts between the medical ethical principles, were presented to participants who then made judgments about the ethicality of the action in the scenario, and their intentions to act in the same manner if they were in the situation. RESULTS: Individual preferences for these medical ethical principles can be measured using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This technique provides a useful tool in which to highlight individual medical ethical values. On average, individuals have a significant preference for non-maleficence over the other principles, however, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this preference does not seem to relate to applied ethical judgements in specific ethical dilemmas. CONCLUSIONS: People state they value these medical ethical principles but they do not actually seem to use them directly in the decision making process. The reasons for this are explained through the lack of a behavioural model to account for the relevant situational factors not captured by the principles. The limitations of the principles in predicting ethical decision making are discussed."

The mammalian high mobility group proteins HMG1 and HMG2 are abundant, chromatin-associated proteins whose cellular function is not known. In this study we show that these proteins can substitute for the prokaryotic DNA-bending protein HU in promoting the assembly of the Hin invertasome, an intermediate structure in Hin-mediated site-specific DNA inversion. Formation of this complex requires the assembly of the Hin recombinase, the Fis protein, and three cis-acting DNA sites, necessitating the looping of intervening DNA segments. Invertasome assembly is strongly stimulated by HU or HMG proteins when one of these segments is shorter than 104 bp. By use of ligase-mediated circularization assays, we demonstrate that HMG1 and HMG2 can bend DNA extremely efficiently, forming circles as small as 66 bp, and even 59-bp circles at high HMG protein concentrations. In both invertasome assembly and circularization assays, substrates active in the presence of HMG1 contain one less helical turn of DNA compared with substrates active in the presence of HU protein. Analysis of different domains of HMG1 generated by partial proteolytic digestion indicate that DNA-binding domain B is sufficient for both bending and invertasome assembly. We suggest that an important biological function of HMG1 and HMG2 is to facilitate cooperative interactions between cis-acting proteins by promoting DNA flexibility. A general role for HMG1 and HMG2 in chromatin structure is also suggested by their ability to wrap DNA duplexes into highly compact forms."

STUDY DESIGN: Proof of concept revealing novel methods for bioscaffold production with in vitro and in vivo animal data. SETTING: Multidisciplinary effort encompassing 2 academic institutions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) computed tomography scans were segmented and utilized in image-based CAD to create porous, anatomic structures. Bioresorbable polycaprolactone scaffolds with spherical and random porous architecture were produced using a laser-based 3D printing process. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds was performed in a porcine model. Auricular scaffolds were seeded with chondrogenic growth factors in a hyaluronic acid/collagen hydrogel and cultured in vitro over 2 months' duration. RESULTS: Auricular and nasal constructs with several types of microporous architecture were rapidly manufactured with high fidelity to human patient anatomy. Subcutaneous in vivo implantation of auricular and nasal scaffolds resulted in an excellent appearance and complete soft tissue ingrowth. Histological analysis of in vitro scaffolds demonstrated native-appearing cartilaginous growth that respected the boundaries of the scaffold. CONCLUSION: Integrated, image-based CAD and 3D printing processes generated patient-specific nasal and auricular scaffolds that supported cartilage regeneration."

This paper argues that the four prima facie principles-beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice-afford a good and widely acceptable basis for 'doing good medical ethics'. It confronts objections that the approach is simplistic, incompatible with a virtue-based approach to medicine, that it requires respect for autonomy always to have priority when the principles clash at the expense of clinical obligations to benefit patients and global justice. It agrees that the approach does not provide universalisable methods either for resolving such moral dilemmas arising from conflict between the principles or their derivatives, or universalisable methods for resolving disagreements about the scope of these principles-long acknowledged lacunae but arguably to be found, in practice, with all other approaches to medical ethics. The value of the approach, when properly understood, is to provide a universalisable though prima facie set of moral commitments which all doctors can accept, a basic moral language and a basic moral analytic framework. These can underpin an intercultural 'moral mission statement' for the goals and practice of medicine."

Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is a rare form of diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life. Heterozygous activation mutations in KCNJ11, encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, which acts as a key role in insulin secretion regulation, account for about half of the cases of PNDM. The majority of the patients represent isolated cases resulting from de novo mutations. Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome. Individuals with KCNJ11 mutations have been successfully transitioned from insulin to sulfonylurea (SU) therapy. Furthermore, there have been cases reported with variable improvement in neurological function following a successful switching. We describe a 12-year-old Portuguese girl with PNDM due to the previously reported R201C mutation in the KCNJ11 gene. Her medical history includes prematurity and moderate developmental delay. The mutation was inherited from her mother who has isolated PNDM. The patient was successfully transferred from insulin to SU, whereas her mother showed SU resistance. Despite good glycemic control, no improvements in the cognitive performance were verified. We present our experience in switching treatment from insulin to oral SUs in this family, and also discuss whether or not the girl's developmental delay is related with the Kir6.2 mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first Portuguese patient reported with successful transition to SU treatment."

Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4) Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO). Due to the clinical heterogeneity, time-dependent evolution of symptoms, overlapping phenotypes, and inconsistencies in muscle pathology findings, definitive diagnosis relies on the molecular finding of deleterious mutations. We sequenced the exons and flanking intron region from approximately 350 patients displaying a phenotype consistent with POLG related mitochondrial disease and found informative mutations in 61 (17%). Two mutant alleles were identified in 31 unrelated index patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders. Among them, 20 (67%) had Alpers syndrome, 4 (13%) had arPEO, and 3 (10%) had ANS. In addition, 30 patients carrying one altered POLG allele were found. A total of 25 novel alterations were identified, including 6 null mutations. We describe the predicted structural/functional and clinical importance of the previously unreported missense variants and discuss their likelihood of being pathogenic. In conclusion, sequence analysis allows the identification of mutations responsible for POLG-related disorders and, in most of the autosomal recessive cases where two mutant alleles are found in trans, finding deleterious mutations can provide an unequivocal diagnosis of the disease."

Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a cellular process by which some forms of DNA damage are repaired more rapidly from transcribed strands of active genes than from nontranscribed strands or the overall genome. In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. However, its contribution to the restoration of transcription and to global repair of oxidative damage has not been examined. Here, we report the first direct study of transcriptional recovery following UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage in E. coli. We observed that mutations in mfd or uvrA reduced the rate that transcription recovered following UV-induced damage. In contrast, no difference was detected in the rate of transcription recovery in mfd, uvrA, fpg, nth, or polB dinB umuDC mutants relative to wild-type cells following oxidative damage. mfd mutants were also fully resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and removed oxidative lesions from the genome at rates comparable to wild-type cells. The results demonstrate that Mfd promotes the rapid recovery of gene expression following UV-induced damage in E. coli. In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage."

BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury leads to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, which contributes to cell death. The aim of this study is to determine whether ischemic or pharmacological postconditioning with cyclosporine A (CsA) might protect the kidney from lethal reperfusion injury. METHODS: Male mice underwent a unilateral (right) nephrectomy followed by 30 minutes of contralateral (left) clamping of the renal artery. We studied 4 groups at 20 minutes and 24 hours of reperfusion: a sham group (n = 4), an ischemic group (n = 6), CsA-postconditioned group (postcond-CsA, injection of 3 mg/kg of CsA 5 minutes before the end of ischemia, (n = 6), and an ischemic postconditioning (IPC) group (n = 6), consisting of 3 cycles of 30 seconds of renal ischemia with 30 seconds intervening reperfusion. After 24 hours of reperfusion, we measured plasma creatinine, urea, and histological kidney injury. The kidney mitochondria were isolated to assess the mitochondria calcium retention capacity and oxidative phosphorylation. RESULTS: At 24 hours after reperfusion, serum creatinine decreased in postcond-CsA and IPC compared to ischemic group. The histological score was also significantly improved with postcond-CsA and IPC. At 20 minutes and 24 hours of reperfusion, calcium retention capacity was decreased significantly in the ischemic group. The mitochondrial respiration stay decreased in the ischemic group at 24 hours of reperfusion, whereas the respiration was improved significantly in the postcond-CsA and IPC group. Bax and cleaved caspase 3 decreased in PostCsA and IPC group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IPC and CsA, administered immediately before reperfusion, protect the kidney from lethal injury."

In addition, citrullination has been shown to be associated with several diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. To get more insight into the role of PAD enzymes and citrullination in both health and disease, experimental strategies to study PAD activity and to characterize citrullinated proteins in complex biological samples are crucial. Here, we describe the chemical, proteomic and antibody-based procedures that are currently available and discuss their applicability for the analysis of complex samples. The methods that have been developed can be used to provide more insight in the substrate specificity of PAD enzymes. Because the evidence that PADs play a pathophysiological role in the diseases mentioned above is increasing, they become attractive targets for therapeutic interventions.

Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy. In this study, 239 samples obtained from 215 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were tested for the presence of the seven most common mutations in the KRAS gene and the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Among the tested patients, 53.8% of patients had wt-KRAS genotype and 46.2% were KRAS mutants. Around five percent (5.1%) of the tested patients bore the V600E mutation in BRAF gene. All the patients showing to have the V600E mutation in BRAF were wt-KRAS. The concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status between primary and metastatic tumor tissue samples was 100%. We have shown that the proportions of mutated and non-mutated KRAS in Slovene patients, as well as the proportion of V600E mutations in BRAF is similar to genotyping results reported by other authors. The tested seven KRAS mutations on codons 12 and 13 were mutually exclusive with the V600E mutation in the BRAF gene. Summing up the results about the KRAS and the BRAF mutation carriers from our study, the portion of potentially non-responsive patients for the anti-EGFR treatment is 51.3%."

However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown. METHODS: We previously showed that the inheritance pattern of MMD is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families. We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad. Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and age-dependent penetrance of the disease. RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704. Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in all families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes.

          "context": "Identification of tumour-specific epigenetic events in medulloblastoma development by hypermethylation profiling. Medulloblastoma arises in the cerebellum and is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood, however its molecular basis is not well understood. To assess the role of aberrant epigenetic events in medulloblastoma and identify critical genes in its development, we profiled the promoter methylation status of 11 candidate tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs; p14(ARF), p15(INK4b), p16(INK4a), CASP8, HIC1, EDNRB, TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1, RIZ1 and RASSF1A) in medulloblastoma cell lines, primary tumours and the normal cerebellum. Gene-specific TSG methylation was a significant feature of both medulloblastomas and the cerebellum. Extensive hypermethylation of RASSF1A was detected frequently in medulloblastomas but not in the normal cerebellum (41/44 primary tumours versus 0/5 normal cerebella). In contrast, complete methylation of HIC1 and CASP8 in a subset of primary tumours (17/44 and 14/39) occurred against a consistent background of partial methylation in the normal cerebellum. These data therefore indicate that extensive methylation of RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 are tumour-specific events in medulloblastoma. Moreover, methylation of these genes in medulloblastoma cell lines was associated with their epigenetic transcriptional silencing and methylation-dependent re-expression following treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3, TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation."

Imprinted genes play important roles in the regulation of growth and development, and several have been shown to influence behavior. Their allele-specific expression depends on inheritance from either the mother or the father, and is regulated by \"imprinting control regions\" (ICRs). ICRs are controlled by DNA methylation, which is present on one of the two parental alleles only. These allelic methylation marks are established in either the female or the male germline, following the erasure of preexisting DNA methylation in the primordial germ cells. After fertilization, the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is maintained in all somatic cells of the developing embryo. This epigenetic \"life cycle\" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) can be disrupted in several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome and Hydatidiform mole. In the neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, the way the ICR mediates imprinted expression is perturbed. Recent studies indicate that assisted reproduction technologies (ART) can sometimes affect the epigenetic cycle of imprinting as well, and that this gives rise to imprinting disease syndromes. This finding warrants careful monitoring of the epigenetic effects, and absolute risks, of currently used and novel reproduction technologies."

Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1, consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1 (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1, Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2, but further work is required to establish its role."

EXPERT OPINION: Antiretroviral treatment prevents the progressive destruction of the immune system by the HIV, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. The efficacy and tolerability of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF compared to current standard of care as a single-tablet treatment choice has been shown in study 102 and study 103. Its use is restricted to patients without significant pre-existing renal impairment and may be limited by concomitant medications but undoubtedly increases treatment choice for HIV-1-infected adults."

Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the development of a safe and effective anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will require therapeutic levels of anti-Abeta antibodies, while avoiding proinflammatory adjuvants and autoreactive T cells which may increase the incidence of adverse events in the elderly population targeted to receive immunotherapy. The first active immunization clinical trial with AN1792 in AD patients was halted when a subset of patients developed meningoencephalitis. The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers. The proposed remedy is to treat future patients with lower doses, particularly in the ApoE4 carriers. Currently there are at least five ongoing anti-Abeta immunotherapy clinical trials. Three of the clinical trials use humanized monoclonal antibodies, which are expensive and require repeated dosing to maintain therapeutic levels of the antibodies in the patient. However in the event of an adverse response to the passive therapy antibody delivery can simply be halted, which may provide a resolution to the problem. Because at this point we cannot readily identify individuals in the preclinical or prodromal stages of AD pathogenesis, passive immunotherapy is reserved for those that already have clinical symptoms. Unfortunately those individuals have by that point accumulated substantial neuropathology in affected regions of the brain. Moreover, if Abeta pathology drives tau pathology as reported in several transgenic animal models, and once established if tau pathology can become self propagating, then early intervention with anti-Abeta immunotherapy may be critical for favorable clinical outcomes. On the other hand, active immunization has several significant advantages, including lower cost and the typical immunization protocol should be much less intrusive to the patient relative to passive therapy, in the advent of Abeta-antibody immune complex-induced adverse events the patients will have to receive immuno-supperssive therapy for an extended period until the anti Abeta antibody levels drop naturally as the effects of the vaccine decays over time. Obviously, improvements in vaccine design are needed to improve both the safety, as well as the efficacy of anti-Abeta immunotherapy. The focus of this review is on the advantages of DNA vaccination for anti-Abeta immunotherapy, and the major hurdles, such as immunosenescence, selection of appropriate molecular adjuvants, universal T cell epitopes, and possibly a polyepitope design based on utilizing existing memory T cells in the general population that were generated in response to childhood or seasonal vaccines, as well as various infections. Ultimately, we believe that the further refinement of our AD DNA epitope vaccines, possibly combined with a prime boost regime will facilitate translation to human clinical trials in either very early AD, or preferably in preclinical stage individuals identified by validated AD biomarkers."

Over the last few years, genetic findings have changed our views on Parkinson's disease (PD), as mutations in a growing number of genes are found to cause monogenic forms of the disorder. Point mutations in the gene for alpha-synuclein, as well as duplications and triplications of the wild-type gene cause a dominant form of PD in rare families, pointing towards mishandling of this protein as a crucial step in the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder. Mutations in the gene for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have recently been identified as a much more common cause for dominant PD, while mutations in the parkin gene, in DJ-1, PINK1 and ATP13A2 all cause autosomal-recessive parkinsonism of early onset. Mutations in recessive genes probably are pathogenic through loss-of-function mechanisms, suggesting that their wild-type products protect dopaminergic cells against a variety of insults. Evidence is emerging that at least some of these genes may play a direct role in the etiology of the common sporadic form of PD. Further, it is likely that the cellular pathways identified in rare monogenic variants of the disease also shed light on the molecular pathogenesis in typical sporadic PD."

Yeast RNA binding proteins Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. In this paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of CUTs. In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components for degradation. Dissection of a CUT terminator reveals a minimal element sufficient for Nrd1- and Nab3-directed termination. These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome."

Previous studies have shown that the breakpoints are consistently located within specific regions of the proximal short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, and 21. The high prevalence of these translocations, the consistent breakpoints found, and the fact that roughly 50% of cases occur sporadically suggest that the sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangement and that the rearrangements occur through a specific mechanism. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed hamster-human somatic cell hybrids derived from de novo rob(14q21q) patients that contained the translocated chromosome segregated from the other acrocentric chromosomes. We determined the physical order of five satellite III subfamilies on 14p, and investigated their involvement in formation of these de novo translocations."

We identify a new mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes. Human breast and colorectal cancer cells release exosomes containing full-length, signaling-competent EGFR ligands. Exosomes isolated from MDCK cells expressing individual full-length EGFR ligands displayed differential activities; AREG exosomes increased invasiveness of recipient breast cancer cells 4-fold over TGF\u03b1 or HB-EGF exosomes and 5-fold over equivalent amounts of recombinant AREG. Exosomal AREG displayed significantly greater membrane stability than TGF\u03b1 or HB-EGF. An average of 24\u00a0AREG molecules are packaged within an individual exosome, and AREG exosomes are rapidly internalized by recipient cells. Whether the composition and behavior of exosomes differ between nontransformed and transformed cells is unknown. Exosomes from DLD-1\u00a0colon cancer cells with a mutant KRAS allele exhibited both higher AREG levels and greater invasive potential than exosomes from isogenically matched, nontransformed cells in which mutant KRAS was eliminated by homologous recombination.

Five genes have been implicated in Romano-Ward syndrome, the autosomal dominant form of LQTS: KVLQT1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2. Mutations in KVLQT1 and KCNE1 also cause the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, a form of LQTS associated with deafness, a phenotypic abnormality inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used mutational analyses to screen a pool of 262 unrelated individuals with LQTS for mutations in the 5 defined genes. We identified 134 mutations in addition to the 43 that we previously reported. Eighty of the mutations were novel. The total number of mutations in this population is now 177 (68% of individuals). CONCLUSIONS: KVLQT1 (42%) and HERG (45%) accounted for 87% of identified mutations, and SCN5A (8%), KCNE1 (3%), and KCNE2 (2%) accounted for the other 13%. Missense mutations were most common (72%), followed by frameshift mutations (10%), in-frame deletions, and nonsense and splice-site mutations (5% to 7% each).

Weaver syndrome, first described in 1974, is characterized by tall stature, a typical facial appearance, and variable intellectual disability. In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome. To date, we have identified 48 individuals with EZH2 mutations. The mutations were primarily missense mutations occurring throughout the gene, with some clustering in the SET domain (12/48). Truncating mutations were uncommon (4/48) and only identified in the final exon, after the SET domain. Through analyses of clinical data and facial photographs of EZH2 mutation-positive individuals, we have shown that the facial features can be subtle and the clinical diagnosis of Weaver syndrome is thus challenging, especially in older individuals. However, tall stature is very common, reported in >90% of affected individuals. Intellectual disability is also common, present in ~80%, but is highly variable and frequently mild. Additional clinical features which may help in stratifying individuals to EZH2 mutation testing include camptodactyly, soft, doughy skin, umbilical hernia, and a low, hoarse cry. Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes. As mutation testing becomes increasingly accessible and larger numbers of EZH2 mutation-positive individuals are identified, knowledge of the clinical spectrum and prognostic implications of EZH2 mutations should improve."

X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the transcriptional silencing of one X in female mammals, balancing expression of X genes between females (XX) and males (XY). In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) and recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications, including the histone mark H3K27me3. In marsupials, where XIST is missing, H3K27me3 association seems to have different degrees of stability, depending on cell-types and species. However, the complete suite of histone marks associated with the Xi and their stability throughout cell cycle remain a mystery, as does the evolution of an ancient mammal XCI system. Our extensive immunofluorescence analysis (using antibodies against specific histone modifications) in nuclei of mammals distantly related to human and mouse, revealed a general absence from the mammalian Xi territory of transcription machinery and histone modifications associated with active chromatin. Specific repressive modifications associated with XCI in human and mouse were also observed in elephant (a distantly related placental mammal), as was accumulation of XIST RNA. However, in two marsupial species the Xi either lacked these modifications (H4K20me1), or they were restricted to specific windows of the cell cycle (H3K27me3, H3K9me2). Surprisingly, the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated with constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3, H3K9me3). We propose that marsupial XCI is comparable to a system that evolved in the common therian (marsupial and placental) ancestor. Silent chromatin of the early inactive X was exapted from neighbouring constitutive heterochromatin and, in early placental evolution, was augmented by the rise of XIST and the stable recruitment of specific histone modifications now classically associated with XCI."

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of treatment for obesity despite the lack of substantial long-term efficacy. For many who do not respond to lifestyle therapy and are not candidates for weight loss surgery, pharmacotherapy is a viable treatment option. Advances in understanding mechanisms of appetite control, nutrient sensing, and energy expenditure have not only helped shape current drug development but have also changed the way in which antiobesity medications are prescribed. Current antiobesity medications and pharmacological strategies will be reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Two new antiobesity drugs - naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) and liraglutide (Saxenda) - were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and join four other approved obesity medications, including phentermine/topiramate XR (Qsymia) and lorcaserin (Belviq), to form the largest number of medications available for the treatment of obesity. In addition, investigational drugs, like belnoranib, show promise in early clinical trials, brightening the outlook on drug development. SUMMARY: To combat the complex physiological system of energy regulation and the known variation of treatment response, combinatory therapies for obesity, including pharmacotherapy, are needed. Now six US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiobesity medications, including two combination medications, will allow providers to tailor obesity treatment in combination with lifestyle modification for a great number of individuals with obesity."

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents the most prevalent cause of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal infections in health care facilities in the developed world. Disease symptoms are caused by the two homologous exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Standard therapy for CDI involves administration of antibiotics that are associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment paradigms that target the toxins rather than the organism itself. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the antitoxin antibodies are protective in multiple murine models of CDI, including systemic and local (gut) toxin challenge models, as well as primary and recurrent models of infection in mice. Systemically administered actoxumab-bezlotoxumab prevents both the damage to the gut wall and the inflammatory response, which are associated with C. difficile in these models, including in mice challenged with a strain of the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Furthermore, mutant antibodies (N297Q) that do not bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors provide a level of protection similar to that of wild-type antibodies, demonstrating that the mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins and does not involve host effector functions. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the prevention of recurrent disease observed in CDI patients in clinical trials."

VinaMPI efficiently handles multiple proteins in a ligand screen, allowing for high-throughput inverse docking that presents new opportunities for improving the efficiency of the drug discovery pipeline. VinaMPI successfully ran on 84,672 cores with a continual decrease in job completion time with increasing core count.

In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which Bnip3 induces autophagy in adult cardiac myocytes. Overexpression of Bnip3 induced extensive autophagy in adult cardiac myocytes. Fluorescent microscopy studies and ultrastructural analysis revealed selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy in myocytes overexpressing Bnip3. Oxidative stress and increased levels of intracellular Ca(2+) have been reported by others to induce autophagy, but Bnip3-induced autophagy was not abolished by antioxidant treatment or the Ca(2+) chelator BAPT A-AM. We also investigated the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in Bnip3-induced autophagy. Although the mPTP has previously been implicated in the induction of autophagy and selective removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes, mitochondria sequestered by autophagosomes in Bnip3-treated cardiac myocytes had not undergone permeability transition and treatment with the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A did not inhibit mitochondrial autophagy in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, cyclophilin D (cypD) is an essential component of the mPTP and Bnip3 induced autophagy to the same extent in embryonic fibroblasts isolated from wild-type and cypD-deficient mice. These results support a model where Bnip3 induces selective removal of the mitochondria in cardiac myocytes and that Bnip3 triggers induction of autophagy independent of Ca(2+), ROS generation, and mPTP opening."

Conjoined twinning, however, only arises when the twinning event occurs at about the primitive streak stage of development, at about 13-14 days after fertilisation in the human, and is exclusively associated with the monoamniotic monochorionic type of placentation. It is believed that the highest incidence of conjoined twinning is encountered in the human. While monozygotic twinning may be induced experimentally following exposure to a variety of agents, the mechanism of induction of spontaneous twinning in the human remains unknown. All agents that are capable of acting as a twinning stimulus are teratogenic, and probably act by interfering with the spindle apparatus. DISCUSSION: The incidence of the various types of conjoined twinning is discussed. Information from the largest study to date indicates that the spontaneous incidence is about 10.25 per million births. The most common varieties encountered were thoraco-omphalopagus (28%), thoracopagus (18.5%), omphalopagus (10%), parasitic twins (10%) and craniopagus (6%). Of these, about 40% were stillborn, and 60% liveborn, although only about 25% of those that survived to birth lived long enough to be candidates for surgery. Conjoined twinning occurs by the incomplete splitting of the embryonic axis and, with the exception of parasitic conjoined twins, all are symmetrical and \"the same parts are always united to the same parts\". Fusion of monozygotic twins is no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning. Accounts are provided of the anatomical features of each of the commonly encountered varieties."

P-cadherin is a member of the classical cadherin family that forms the transmembrane core of adherens junctions.

The common features of both diseases are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina, while only EEM syndrome shows the additional finding of split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). We identified five consanguineous Pakistani families with either HJMD or EEM syndrome, and detected pathogenic mutations in the CDH3 gene of all five families. In order to define the role of P-cadherin in hair follicle and limb development, we performed expression studies on P-cadherin in the mouse embryo, and demonstrated the predominant expression of P-cadherin not only in the hair follicle placode, but also at the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud. Based on the evidence that mutations in the p63 gene also result in hypotrichosis and SHFM, and that the expression patterns of p63 and P-cadherin overlap in the hair follicle placode and AER, we postulated that CDH3 could be a direct transcriptional target gene of p63. We performed promoter assays and ChIP, which revealed that p63 directly interacts with two distinct regions of the CDH3 promoter. We conclude that P-cadherin is a newly defined transcriptional target gene of p63, with a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the AER during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in mice."

In oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), approximately 5% of somatic embryo-derived regenerants show homeotic changes during floral development, involving an apparent feminization of male parts in flowers of both sexes, called the 'mantled' phenotype. This variant phenotype is associated with a reduction in the level of global DNA methylation. To explore possible relationships between DNA methylation level and accumulation of DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase (DNMT) transcripts, the full-length coding sequences corresponding to three different DNMT families in oil palm, namely the MET, CMT, and DRM classes, have been isolated and characterized. The corresponding genes were designated as EgMET1, EgCMT1, and EgDRM1, and encode predicted polypeptides of 1543, 925, and 591 amino acid residues, respectively. Expression of oil palm DNMTs was compared between normal and variant calli and inflorescence tissues using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. A consistent increase in transcript levels of EgMET1 and EgCMT1 was found in variant fast-growing calli relative to nodular-compact calli. Nodular-compact calli give rise to about 5% of abnormal regenerants whereas fast-growing calli generate 95% of 'mantled' palms in their clonal offspring and were previously demonstrated as having markedly hypomethylated DNA. In immature abnormal inflorescences only EgMET1 transcript levels were increased, while no changes in relative abundance of the EgCMT1 or EgDRM1 transcripts were observed. Therefore, the genome-wide hypomethylation previously described in 'mantled' material cannot be explained by a decrease in expression levels of the de novo or maintenance DNMTs, a paradox which has been previously reported in tumour cells, where there is evidence for global hypomethylation of DNA."

          "context": "Weaver syndrome and EZH2 mutations: Clarifying the clinical phenotype. Weaver syndrome, first described in 1974, is characterized by tall stature, a typical facial appearance, and variable intellectual disability. In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome. To date, we have identified 48 individuals with EZH2 mutations. The mutations were primarily missense mutations occurring throughout the gene, with some clustering in the SET domain (12/48). Truncating mutations were uncommon (4/48) and only identified in the final exon, after the SET domain. Through analyses of clinical data and facial photographs of EZH2 mutation-positive individuals, we have shown that the facial features can be subtle and the clinical diagnosis of Weaver syndrome is thus challenging, especially in older individuals. However, tall stature is very common, reported in >90% of affected individuals. Intellectual disability is also common, present in ~80%, but is highly variable and frequently mild. Additional clinical features which may help in stratifying individuals to EZH2 mutation testing include camptodactyly, soft, doughy skin, umbilical hernia, and a low, hoarse cry. Considerable phenotypic overlap between Sotos and Weaver syndromes is also evident. The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes. As mutation testing becomes increasingly accessible and larger numbers of EZH2 mutation-positive individuals are identified, knowledge of the clinical spectrum and prognostic implications of EZH2 mutations should improve."

The receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 is a breast cancer biomarker whose posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are a key indicator of its activation. Quantifying the expression and PTMs of biomarkers such as ErbB2 by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry has several limitations, including minimal coverage and extensive assay development time. Therefore, we assessed the utility of two high resolution, full scan mass spectrometry approaches, MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2, for targeted ErbB2 proteomics. Endogenous ErbB2 immunoprecipitated from SK-BR-3 cells was in-gel digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, Asp-N, or trypsin plus Asp-N in triplicate. Data-dependent acquisition with an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600 and MS1 Filtering data processing was used to assess peptide and PTM coverage as well as the reproducibility of enzyme digestion. Data-independent acquisition (SWATH) was also performed for MS2 quantitation. MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2 allow quantitation of all detected analytes after acquisition, enabling the use of multiple proteases for quantitative assessment of target proteins. Combining high resolution proteomics with multiprotease digestion enabled quantitative mapping of ErbB2 with excellent reproducibility, improved amino acid sequence and PTM coverage, and decreased assay development time compared to typical SRM assays. These results demonstrate that high resolution quantitative proteomic approaches are an effective tool for targeted biomarker quantitation."

BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1 monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation. Adults with uncontrolled persistent asthma who are receiving medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting \u03b22 agonist require additional treatment options as add-on therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma on medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting \u03b22 agonist, irrespective of baseline eosinophil count. METHODS: We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, pivotal phase 2b clinical trial at 174 study sites across 16 countries or regions. Adults (aged > 18 years) with an asthma diagnosis for 12 months or more based on the Global Initiative for Asthma 2009 Guidelines receiving treatment with medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting \u03b22 agonist were eligible for participation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks, or placebo, over a 24-week period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline at week 12 in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 in L) in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at least 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients that received at least one dose or part of a dose of study drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01854047, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-000856-16. FINDINGS: 769 patients (158 in the placebo group and 611 in the dupilumab groups) received at least one dose of study drug. In the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL, the greatest increases (200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70008; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70063) in FEV1 compared with placebo were observed at week 12 with doses every 2 weeks in the 300 mg group (mean change 0\u00b739 L [SE 0\u00b705]; mean difference 0\u00b721 [95% CI 0\u00b706-0\u00b736; p=0\u00b70063]) and in the 200 mg group (mean change 0\u00b743 L [SE 0\u00b705]; mean difference 0\u00b726 [0\u00b711-0\u00b740; p=0\u00b70008]) compared with placebo (0\u00b718 L [SE 0\u00b705]). Similar significant increases were observed in the overall population and in the fewer than 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL subgroup (overall population: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p<0\u00b70001; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p<0\u00b70001; <300 eosinophils per \u03bcL: 200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70034; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0\u00b70086), and were maintained to week 24. Likewise, dupilumab every 2 weeks produced the greatest reductions in annualised rates of exacerbation in the overall population (70-70\u00b75%), the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL (71\u00b72-80\u00b77%), and the subgroup with fewer than 300 eosinophils per \u03bcL (59\u00b79-67\u00b76%). The most common adverse events with dupilumab compared with placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (33-41% vs 35%) and injection-site reactions (13-26% vs 13%). INTERPRETATION: Dupilumab increased lung function and reduced severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma irrespective of baseline eosinophil count and had a favourable safety profile, and hence in addition to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting \u03b22-agonist therapy could improve the lives of patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma compared with standard therapy alone.

X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the transcriptional silencing of one X in female mammals, balancing expression of X genes between females (XX) and males (XY). In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) and recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications, including the histone mark H3K27me3. In marsupials, where XIST is missing, H3K27me3 association seems to have different degrees of stability, depending on cell-types and species. However, the complete suite of histone marks associated with the Xi and their stability throughout cell cycle remain a mystery, as does the evolution of an ancient mammal XCI system. Our extensive immunofluorescence analysis (using antibodies against specific histone modifications) in nuclei of mammals distantly related to human and mouse, revealed a general absence from the mammalian Xi territory of transcription machinery and histone modifications associated with active chromatin. Specific repressive modifications associated with XCI in human and mouse were also observed in elephant (a distantly related placental mammal), as was accumulation of XIST RNA. However, in two marsupial species the Xi either lacked these modifications (H4K20me1), or they were restricted to specific windows of the cell cycle (H3K27me3, H3K9me2). Surprisingly, the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated with constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3, H3K9me3). We propose that marsupial XCI is comparable to a system that evolved in the common therian (marsupial and placental) ancestor. Silent chromatin of the early inactive X was exapted from neighbouring constitutive heterochromatin and, in early placental evolution, was augmented by the rise of XIST and the stable recruitment of specific histone modifications now classically associated with XCI."

          "context": "A novel fully automated molecular diagnostic system (AMDS) for colorectal cancer mutation detection. BACKGROUND: KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations are frequently observed in colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, KRAS mutations are strong predictors for clinical outcomes of EGFR-targeted treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). For mutation analysis, the current methods are time-consuming, and not readily available to all oncologists and pathologists. We have developed a novel, simple, sensitive and fully automated molecular diagnostic system (AMDS) for point of care testing (POCT). Here we report the results of a comparison study between AMDS and direct sequencing (DS) in the detection of KRAS, BRAF and PI3KCA somatic mutations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: DNA was extracted from a slice of either frozen (n = 89) or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) CRC tissue (n = 70), and then used for mutation analysis by AMDS and DS. All mutations (n = 41 among frozen and 27 among FFPE samples) detected by DS were also successfully (100%) detected by the AMDS. However, 8 frozen and 6 FFPE samples detected as wild-type in the DS analysis were shown as mutants in the AMDS analysis. By cloning-sequencing assays, these discordant samples were confirmed as true mutants. One sample had simultaneous \"hot spot\" mutations of KRAS and PIK3CA, and cloning assay comfirmed that E542K and E545K were not on the same allele. Genotyping call rates for DS were 100.0% (89/89) and 74.3% (52/70) in frozen and FFPE samples, respectively, for the first attempt; whereas that of AMDS was 100.0% for both sample sets. For automated DNA extraction and mutation detection by AMDS, frozen tissues (n = 41) were successfully detected all mutations within 70 minutes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: AMDS has superior sensitivity and accuracy over DS, and is much easier to execute than conventional labor intensive manual mutation analysis. AMDS has great potential for POCT equipment for mutation analysis."

Constitutional t(11;22)(q23;q11) is the most frequent recurrent non-Robertsonian translocation in humans. Balanced carriers of t(11;22) usually manifest no clinical symptoms, and are often identified after the birth of offspring with an unbalanced form of this translocation, known as Emanuel syndrome. To determine the prevalence of the disorder, we sent surveillance questionnaires to 735 core hospitals in Japan. The observed number of Emanuel syndrome cases was 36 and that of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 40. On the basis of the de novo t(11;22) translocation frequency in sperm from healthy men, we calculated the frequency of the translocations in the general population. Accordingly, the prevalence of Emanuel syndrome was estimated at 1 in 110,000. Based on this calculation, the estimated number of Emanuel syndrome cases in Japan is 1063 and of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 16,604, which are much higher than the numbers calculated from the questionnaire responses. It is possible that this discordance is partly attributable to a lack of disease identification. Further efforts should be made to increase the awareness of Emanuel syndrome to ensure a better quality of life for affected patients and their families."

Trispecific Abs exhibited higher potency and breadth than any previously described single bnAb, showed pharmacokinetics similar to those of human bnAbs, and conferred complete immunity against a mixture of simian-human immunodeficiency\u00a0viruses (SHIVs) in nonhuman primates, in contrast to single bnAbs.
